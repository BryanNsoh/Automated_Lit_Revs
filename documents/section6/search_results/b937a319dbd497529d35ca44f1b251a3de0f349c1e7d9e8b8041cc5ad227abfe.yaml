    23133 Abstract Purpose This paper aims to investigate the way in which blockchain
    technology is likely to influence future supply chain practices and policies.
    Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of both academic and practitioner
    literature was conducted. Multiple accounts of blockchain adoption within industry
    were also consulted to gain further insight. Findings While blockchain technologies
    remain in their infancy, they are gaining momentum within supply chains, trust
    being the predominant factor driving their adoption. The value of such technologies
    for supply chain management lies in four areas: extended visibility and traceability,
    supply chain digitalisation and disintermediation, improved data security and
    smart contracts. Several challenges and gaps in understanding and opportunities
    for further research are identified by this research. How a blockchain-enabled
    supply chain should be configured has also been explored from a design perspective.
    Research limitations/implications This systematic review focuses on the diffusion
    of blockchain technology within supply chains, and great care was taken in selecting
    search terms. However, the authors acknowledge that their choice of terms may
    have excluded certain blockchain articles from this review. Practical implications
    This paper offers valuable insight for supply chain practitioners into how blockchain
    technology has the potential to disrupt existing supply chain provisions as well
    as a number of challenges to its successful diffusion. Social implications The
    paper debates the poential social and economic impact brought by blockchain. Originality/value
    This paper is one of the first studies to examine the current state of blockchain
    diffusion within supply chains. It lays a firm foundation for future research.

    the incumbent industry to smart industry featured with data-driven decision-making.
    However, intrinsic features of IoT result in a number of challenges, such as decentralization,
    poor interoperability, privacy, and security vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology
    brings the opportunities in addressing the challenges of IoT. In this paper, we
    investigate the integration of blockchain technology with IoT. We name such synthesis
    of blockchain and IoT as blockchain of things (BCoT). This paper presents an in-depth
    survey of BCoT and discusses the insights of this new paradigm. In particular,
    we first briefly introduce IoT and discuss the challenges of IoT. Then, we give
    an overview of blockchain technology. We next concentrate on introducing the convergence
    of blockchain and IoT and presenting the proposal of BCoT architecture. We further
    discuss the issues about using blockchain for fifth generation beyond in IoT as
    well as industrial applications of BCoT. Finally, we outline the open research
    directions in this promising area. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal

    Metrics Abstract: Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades,
    there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such
    as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism
    and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications,
    security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open
    channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and
    standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of
    aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based
    upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high
    computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions
    have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness,
    data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To
    handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions.
    Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various
    blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based
    applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored
    the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart
    applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain
    applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits
    of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their
    countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based
    security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers
    about its applicability in various applications. Topic: Deep Learning Algorithms

    With the wide popularity of Internet and related technologies, various Industry
    4.0-based applications have been used across the globe in which sensors and actuators
    sense, compute and communicate the data for industry automation. As in Industry
    4.0-based applications, data between different locations flows using an open channel,
    i.e., Internet, so threats to security and privacy has also increased manyfold
    [1]. Such applications deal with data in large volumes and hence, so it is necessary
    to consider issues such as-data heterogeneity, data integrity, and data redundancy
    alongwith the security and privacy concerns. Moreover, different applications
    require datasets from different domains in different formats. Therefore, it is
    also needed to standardize the data format so that it can be used by different
    Industry 4.0-based applications. The usage of smart phones and smart applications
    for personal, professional, and social activities is increasing exponentially
    across the globe. It results an increase in both the network data traffic (in
    GBs) and overall expenditure (in Billions USD) as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b)
    as per the report mentioned in [2], [3]. According to this report, smart industries
    would spend $40B on IoT by 2020 in various sectors including transportation and
    manufacturing. However, due to the large number of data exchanges over the Internet,
    maintaining confidentiality, privacy, and integrity becomes a major issue in Industry
    4.0 [4]. Moreover, according to the surveys conducted by different agencies [5],
    [6] nearly 60 millions people are affected by identity theft and 12 billion peoples
    records misused in 2018 and expected to increase to 33 billion by 2023 as shown
    in Fig. 2 (a). Fig. 2(b) shows the 10 recent security breaches incidents reported
    till July 2018, which are expected to increase in the years to come. FIGURE 1.
    Statistics of (a) Data traffic per month region wise and (b) Application-wise
    expenditure on Industry 4.0. Show All FIGURE 2. (a) Increase in identity theft
    and (b) Generation of data traffic. Show All Security and privacy preservation
    are important concerns for Industry 4.0 applications [4], [7]. There may be chances
    of unauthorized data breaching or information leakage leading to the financial
    losses to Industry 4.0-based applications. In the absence of robust security architecture,
    the system along with data are prone to various types of attacks (such as DDoS,
    ARP spoofing attacks, data rate alteration, network congestion, manipulation,
    noise interference, phishing and config threats) which can harm the confidentiality
    and integrity of data and can affect the overall functioning of any system. For
    such types of attacks, prevention is better than any reactive defense mechanisms
    to assure confidentiality, integrity, and privacy within the legal compliance
    rules [8]. It has been found in the literature that with an increasing rate of
    automation in Industry 4.0., the probability of violating the security rules and
    launching new type of cyber-attacks is also increasing. Access control, authorization,
    confidentiality, availability, and integrity are the prime concerns in Industry
    4.0. To mitigate the aforementioned threats, current Industry solutions are using
    the centralized, client-server based architecture in which the centralized authority
    holds all the privileges. But, if the centralized authority is compromised then
    the entire system may crash. Conventional security mechanisms such as Data Encryption
    Standard (DES), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and their variants are
    also being used but they have high computation and communication overhead. However,
    a revolution in this area came with the introduction of the concept of “Bitcoins”
    [9]. For example, Authors of [10] illustrated that how blockchain technology can
    be used to deal with privacy & security issues in Industry 4.0 [11]. The blockchain
    technology has the potential to handle various security attacks as it can eliminate
    the need of the centralized authority to perform various operations. In the blockchain
    technology, a number of users participate in transaction verification and validation
    [12]–[17]. It uses a structural distributed database which stores data from all
    the nodes in an encrypted form validated using various checks such as Merkle hash
    tree (MHT) and Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) [17]. As the database is distributed,
    so there is a risk of getting crashed or corrupted. Transactions are linked together
    with cryptographic keys and immutable ledgers which makes it difficult for attackers
    to manipulate or delete the recorded information. Data is always stored in an
    immutable manner using timestamps, public audit and consensus mechanisms [18],
    [19]. The use of these mechanisms makes security architecture a robust and assures
    data integrity and privacy [20]. A. Scope of This Survey Article The blockchain
    reduces the risk of single point of failure and network attacks using the distributed
    network nodes. Use of the decentralized platform reduces fraud by time stamping
    entries, and information of users is stored in immutable ledger across the network
    using the smart contact. Blockchain eliminates manual processes like reconciliation
    between multiple isolated ledger and administrative processes which helps to reduce
    the cost of the system. Due to the use of various cryptographic linked chains,
    the speed of transaction and level of security is enhanced manyfold. Several surveys
    are conducted by the researchers using the blockchain technology for Industry
    4.0 which are summarized as follows [21]. Mettler [22] explored how blockchain
    technology revolutionized the healthcare alongwith various open challenges [23],
    [24]. Yli-Huumo et al. [25] reviewed the current scenario of the blockchain technology
    and its research gaps and challenges. They have also discussed the suitability
    of the blockchain for various smart applications. Ahram et al. [26] discussed
    the various components in blockchains such as decentralized techniques and immutability
    of ledger that makes it difficult to attack the system [27]. Weiss et al. [28]
    discussed about blockchain public healthcare applications. They have also explored
    how the blockchain technology eliminates the centralized authority during the
    verification process, its digital signatures [29] for safe data repository, its
    architecture, and also the challenges. Zhang et al. [30] evaluated the metrics
    of blockchain-based decentralized applications. In this paper, they considered
    the evolution metrics, security, and challenges which are important for various
    applications like healthcare, smart-agriculture, IoT, and tourism & hospitality.
    Krieger et al. [31] explored an advanced blockchain architecture for the electronic
    health systems. They focused on the regulatory compliance for the data privacy
    of blockchain, its architecture, limitations, and benefits [32]. Duan et al. [33]
    explored educational applications of the blockchain technology. In this paper,
    an automated evaluation software as a tool with blocks is proposed, which contains
    graduation marks along with the certificate. They also highlighted how blocks
    are recorded, Merkle hash tree, hash functions, digital signatures, and timestamp
    mechanisms during the verification of various transactions. Radanović and Likić
    et al. [34] explored the opportunity of applying blockchain technology in the
    medical domain. Authors focused on the areas such as supply-chain of drugs, pharmaceuticals,
    and health insurance with associated challenges. They also discussed how the blockchain
    can be used in countries like USA and India for the land registration. Vujičić
    et al. [35] gave an overview of blockchain bitcoin and Etheruem cryptocurrency
    platforms. In this paper, the authors explained the architecture, security parameters,
    and challenges for implementation of blockchain in various applications. Chen
    [36] discussed the tokenization of money that uses the blockchain. In this paper,
    the working of the token and their types such as token, initial coin offering,
    and its currency are discussed. Gatteschi et al. [37] explained whether the adoption
    of the blockchain in different industries can improve their productivity. Authors
    showed the blockchains has been used in various smart applications. Authors also
    described the functionality, architecture, techniques used, security parameters,
    and open research areas. Kumara and Mallickb et al. [38] explored the blockchain
    security, issues and challenges in IoT systems. They discussed various existing
    security and privacy issues related to IoT devices and the possible solutions
    by the adoption of blockchain technology [39]–[41]. Konstantinidis et al. [42]
    presented various blockchain-based smart business applications. From the above-mentioned
    proposals, we found that most of the recent surveys on the blockchain technology
    have concentrated on various smart application areas in Industry 4.0 and its security
    parameters [43], [44]. The comparative analysis of pre-existing surveys on Blockchain
    with the proposed survey is given in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparative Analysis of
    Pre-Existing Surveys on Blockchain With the Proposed Survey B. Research Contributions

    Background and History of Blockchain A. Traditional Security System and Blockchain
    In the present era, most of the database systems use a centralized client-server
    based architecture. In this systems, a client (user) has the authority to modify
    the data stored in the centralized server. The control of the entire server database
    is with the centralized authority who can control and take decisions with respect
    to various access control policies defined on the data stored in the database.
    They also have the authority to authenticate users credentials before they access
    the database. To resolve the issues in the traditional centralized systems, blockchain
    can be an effective solution. A blockchain is a chain of blocks which can be used
    to store and share data in a distributed, transparent and tamper resistant manner.
    Each block consists of data and is linked with other blocks using pointers. Such
    linkages ensure the integrity and tamper resistance in the blockchain. When a
    new data is added to the blockchain, link to the free end is created which extends
    the blockchain by one block or unit. As more data is added to the blockchain,
    it gets longer and chain grwos in size. If one of the blocks is modified in the
    chain, it breaks cryptographic links which disrupts the whole blockchain. It also
    allows the user to verify the integrity of the stored data. The risk of the centralized
    control system can be eliminated with an implementation of decentralized systems.
    The database authority holds the centralized control on the security needed for
    all the users for the required access. The blockchain stores the data and builds
    the structural data storage which makes the network more secure. Due to this,
    the blockchain technology makes easy records or transactions with heterogeneous
    information in the databases. B. Background of Blockchain The idea of blocks connection
    by cryptographic chains was introduced by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in
    1991. They designed a system, in which information or transaction stored with
    timestamps can not be modified or tampered. After that Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta
    proposed verification and validation of various transactions using the Merkle
    tree. In the Merkle tree, recorded data was gathered into a single block with
    an improved quality. Satoshi Nakamoto created the initial blockchain network in
    2008 [9]. He introduced the hash function method to create blocks in the chain.
    The major attempt was to improve the architecture and development of the blockchain
    in which there was no need of sign by the clients or the users. This implementation
    build the network for cryptocurrency recognized as bitcoin. The bitcoin network
    is publicly available ledger for all the transaction records. In his research
    work, blocks and chain were separate words which are combined together known as
    blockchain. They got the bitcoin network file size and the records of its transactions
    reached up to 20 GB by 2014, which went to 30 GB between the last quarter of 2014
    to 2015. The bitcoin network was pushed from 50GB to 100 GB in January 2017. The
    blockchain is used in the finance or cryptocurrency applications as it enhances
    the quality of various applications with respect to speed, security ease of use,
    and confidentiality. To explore the possibilities of applying blockchain technology
    in various industries, many companies have established their research centers
    for growth of this technology. For example, IBM has its research center in Singapore
    which was inaugurated in July 2016. In November 2016, the group of world economic
    forum discussed the development of the governance models for the blockchain technology.
    The global blockchain forum introduced the chamber of digital commerce in 2016
    by Accenture’s trade group. Emma Macclarkin suggested the use of blockchain to
    enhance the trade which was executed by the European parliament’s trade in 2018.
    How blockchain revolutionized: The revolution of blockchain technology from inception
    to till today is explained in detail as shown in Fig 4. FIGURE 4. Generations
    of Blockchain. Show All 1) Blockchain 1.0 The first generation of the technology
    was started with the bitcoin network in 2009, which is known as blockchain 1.0.
    In this generation, the creation of the first cryptocurrencies was introduced.
    The idea was all about payment and its functionalities to generate cryptocurrency.
    2) Blockchain 2.0 In the second level of the blockchain technology, smart contract
    and financial services for various applications were introduced in 2010. The development
    of blockchain with Etheruem and Hyperledger frameworks was proposed in this generation.
    3) Blockchain 3.0 In this generation of blockchains, the convergence towards the
    decentralized applications was introduced. Various research areas such as health,
    governance, IoT, supply-chain, business, and smart city were considered for building
    decentralized applications [46]. In this level, etheruem, hyperledger, and other
    platforms were used which having the ability to code smart contracts for a variety
    of decentralized applications [47], [48]. 4) Blockchain 4.0 This generation mainly
    focused on services such as public ledger and distributed databases in real-time.
    This level has seamless integration of Industry 4.0-based applications. It uses
    the smart contract which eliminates the need for paper-based contracts and regulates
    within the network by its consensus [49]. Blockchain Requirements: Smart Contracts:
    It is a protocol which allows the performance of transactions in absence of third
    party that makes transactions irreversible and traceable. Tokenization: It is
    one of the most important things that must to be included in the blockchain. It
    facilitates digital representation of the goods, services, and rights with the
    help of tokens. It allows the exchange of values and trust for different users
    without involving the central authority. Data security: Security compliance is
    a major and essential requirement of blockchain technology with a legal point
    of view. Decentralised data storage: It is a basic requirement of the distributed
    system. Immutability: All the records on the network should not be modified or
    tampered in the shared ledger. This enables the integrity of the stored data.
    Consensus: Transactions should only be updated when all the verified users in
    the network agree for the same. Typed Blocks: It is required for the smart contract
    and for high speed payment in business transactions. So, data formatting of the
    different types of blocks include its time, consensus algorithm [50], number of
    transaction per blocks, and its content data types. Sharding: It is required for
    the separation of content over subsets of nodes in a way, that not all the nodes
    need to carry all processing load or any burden. Access rights management: Encryption
    based private and public key cryptography and distributed databases with user
    identification is required to assign and manage access rights. Standards used
    to manage permissioned blockchains: Immutability of the blockchain network makes
    the data access in a specific order. The public certificates are available in
    public blockchain, but without having the private key, authorization cannot be
    provided to the users. So, all the data should be managed in order of data elements
    like user’s internet protocol (IP) address, name, its code, and extensible markup
    language. These all are published to the consortium with the communication process.
    Standard data formatting: In the blockchain system, it is also needed to standardize
    the data formats with respect to Application Programming Interfaces (API). Each
    organization in the blockchain network needs to use the same data format or APIs
    to communicate in the same network. Updatability: The need for data updation in
    the distributed ledger is most important for records. In a peer-to-peer network,
    data needs to be structured and systematically updated for each node that transacts
    within the network. P2P encryption between blockchain nodes: Encryption is needed
    to secure the transactions between the end nodes that may link together in the
    blockchain protocol. UX: One of the major factors in a system is the user interface
    design that provides an easy and convenient application environment to the users.
    The main difference between the blockchain-based and non-blockchain-based systems
    is the manner in which the user perceives it. Development operation: The main
    step in the production of the system is the selection of platforms that requires
    less time and the setup complexity. SECTION III. Blockchain Architecture and its
    Components A. Basic Blockchain Based Architecture In the basic architecture of
    the blockchain, each transaction needs to be verified which can not be altered
    as shown in Fig. 5. FIGURE 5. The basic blockchain-based architecture. Show All
    1) Addition of Transactions in the Block Structure A blockchain transaction has
    various steps. First, a network node or user requests for a new transaction. After
    that, the transaction is recorded in the block format or structure. The block
    structure consists of the index, time-stamp, data, previous hash, and current
    block hash. 2) Transmission to Peer Nodes A block of transactions is broadcasted
    to the peer nodes available in the network. 3) Validation of Transactions The
    blockchain network uses SHA-256 algorithm for creating a unique hash. Each block
    in the blockchain is linked with the hash of the previous block which makes an
    unbreakable network of transactions. If someone tries to append a transaction,
    then it must be validated by the network nodes or by smart contracts, and consensus.
    This immutable ledger cannot be modified, it can only be appended to the transaction
    of blocks, which results in a secured and reliable decentralized system. Various
    algorithms are used to validate transactions and user status. 4) Block Added to
    Ledger The new transactions are first verified by the other nodes and then they
    are added in a new block for the ledger or chain. The existing blockchain is extended
    by addition of a new block that is unalterable and undeletable for any other users.
    B. Reference Architecture The blockchain reference architecture consists of three
    different networks which combine together and run the whole blockchain application
    for the users. The three different networks are the public network, cloud network,
    and enterprise network as shown in Fig 6. Each has its own capabilities and functionalities
    for the smooth working of the decentralized applications. FIGURE 6. A blockchain-based
    reference architecture. Show All 1) Public Network In this network, the users,
    edge services, and peer cloud providers are connected or linked together. a: Users
    In the public network, the users manage the distribution and creation of the blockchain
    decentralized application and execute the operations with the help of the blockchain
    network. Users have different roles as follows: b: Developer Developers make various
    types of applications for the client or users with different functionalities.
    They develop the smart contract for the interaction with the users which helps
    to add transactions or records within the blockchain network. The developers can
    also build the inheritance applications for facilitating communication in the
    blockchain. c: Administrator The functionality of the administrator is to produce,
    maintain, and configure decentralized applications for the blockchain network.
    d: Operator Operators have the control to monitor and manage the blockchain network
    and its applications. e: Auditor The blockchain auditors maintain or review the
    history of the transactions over the blockchain network for business and legal
    compliance point of view. f: Edge Services These services authorize the information
    that gets transferred via the internet to the cloud, enterprise applications,
    and client applications. They maintain systems such as domain name systems, content
    delivery networks, firewalls, and load balancers. Domain name systems are used
    to correct the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web sites that are linked
    to the Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (TCP-IP) address for the
    system which is to be used for the resources. The content delivery network carries
    user applications, which gives the geolocation for the distributed systems which
    are installed to minimize the response time for the distributed users in the network.
    The firewall is responsible to maintain and give access control to the incoming
    and outgoing traffic in the network allowing or blocking the access. The load
    balancers are used for the distribution of the network traffic to maintain minimum
    response time, latency, and maximize throughput across the resources such as computers,
    processors, and storage systems. They are needed to balance the load in local
    and global systems. 2) Interaction Option In the blockchain, there are various
    ways through which users can interact with the blockchain network, they are shown
    below as: a: Software Development Kit The SDK is useful for facilitating interaction
    between applications and their platforms. Blockchain application development lifecycle
    has a number of phases such as developing phase, debugging phase, testing phase,
    and production phase. The blockchain applications need to interact and communicate
    with the network when the software development cycle executes. b: Client Software
    Development Kit It is a client-side programming library, which provides API methods
    to be used by the end user program to give access functionality within the blockchain
    network. The programs are written in Java, Python, and other languages and the
    kit also supports development tools. c: Command Line Interface Developers and
    administrator usually need activities such as monitoring, managing accounts of
    users, and importing & exporting some text commands formats. All these activities
    can be executed through the command line interface. 3) Cloud Network The cloud
    network consists of a variety of running nodes, each with its own capability and
    functionality. The cloud network includes the blockchain applications, application
    programming interface, blockchain services, security services, and system integration.
    a: Blockchain Applications There are various types of applications such as web
    application, end-user applications and server-based applications. Users play different
    roles such as business users, administrators, auditors, and operators. The blockchain
    applications use the APIs for the post and get services of the resources like
    databases. A variety of applications such as healthcare, financial sector, insurance,
    energy domain, supply-chain, and IoT can be enabled with the blockchain to minimize
    the cost and time [51]–[56]. b: Application Programming Interface An API is useful
    for the developers and users to reuse the data or information and its analytics
    with their services. It can be called by different cross-platform technologies.
    Blockchain technology provides various APIs for the application interfaces to
    use the components that can be handled in the business transactions. c: Blockchain
    Services For the performance and functional environment of the blockchain systems,
    there is a range of services such as: d: Members This service manages the user
    ids, credentials, and the history of users transactions in a confidential manner
    over the blockchain network. The permissioned network needs to validate the users
    of ongoing transactions and the users identification for the record of transaction
    and verification, so it requires membership in the network. In such networks,
    users have the access control to allow or block the transaction. In a non-permissioned
    network, it does not require the authorization by the user while submitting the
    transaction details. e: Consensus Consensus is a protocol in the blockchain network,
    which must be followed by each node in the network. This protocol specifies time
    validity and rules that need to be followed by all the nodes or users in the network
    to perform various tasks or append transactions in the blockchain network. It
    also maintains a copy of the ledger in the network. f: Ledger All the transactions
    are linked together with a cryptographic hash in the blocks to form a ledger.
    g: Smart Contract In general, a smart contract is a chain of the codes, which
    executes in the blockchain network environment. This code chain communicates the
    conditions or rules for different parties to follow the terms between the nodes
    or users in the network. Smart contract can be developed in the blockchain platform
    with the help of the supported programming languages. h: Secure Runtime In the
    secure runtime environment, blockchain transactions are added in the ledger with
    the secured container such as secure OS, and library of the programming language
    runtime used. i: Event Distribution In the blockchain network, the publisher notifies
    the subscribers for a specific event. The notification is sent in a broadcast
    manner within the network. Subscribers who subscribe to a specific publisher or
    events receive the notification. j: System Integration The blockchain services
    and the enterprise network are combined or integrated together via the application
    programming interface and enterprise service bus. k: Connectivity The connectivity
    between the cloud network and the enterprise network is established by the Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) or the gateway tunnel. It enables the secure connectivity
    and standard data format and filters within the blockchain network. 4) Enterprise
    Network The enterprise network consists of the enterprise directory, its applications,
    and the database. a: Enterprise User Directory In the enterprise applications,
    data or information regarding user authentication, authorization, and personal
    data of users are recorded. The gateway and virtual private network (VPN) maintain
    secured services for the access control of the users. b: Enterprise Applications
    These applications are used for the enterprise that communicates with the blockchain
    network. They also communicate with smart contracts in the network. Hence, smart
    contract collect and store the enterprise data in the network and share that information
    over the applications. They also make requests for availing the services in the
    blockchain network. c: Enterprise Data The enterprise application in the blockchain
    records and maintains the metadata of the system. It also maintains the feedback
    of the system that contains the entire history of the blockchain network. Transactional
    data contains all the records of the network which includes master repository,
    financial information, and business communication. All the data is available via
    data repository and distributed data storage. The second type of blockchain enterprise
    data is application data in which, data is collected and produced by enterprise
    applications and its operations. All the values are added for a better understanding
    of the application performance. The log data is recorded in log files for future
    inspection for the security, governance, or compliance. SECTION IV. Blockchain
    Deployment in Smart Applications The detailed taxonomy of blockchain deployment
    in real-time applications such as energy, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture,
    business, digital content distribution, smart city, IoT [57], supply-chain & logistics,
    and tourism & hospitality [58] is shown in Fig. 7. Table 3 provides the detailed
    relative comparison of the State-of-the-art proposals/Tools used for blockchain-based
    security system. Parameters used for this comparison are objectives, techniques
    used, setup type, programming languages or simulators, pros, and cons of the existing
    tools/frameworks. TABLE 3 State-of-the-Art Proposals/Tools Used for Blockchain-Based
    Security System FIGURE 7. Taxonomy of Blockchain for Industry 4.0. Show All A.
    Supplychain and Logistics Agricultural applications need critical management inputs,
    such as supply-chain management (SCM) which plays a prominent role in human lives.
    Traditional logistic systems used in food-supply and agriculture simply store
    the orders and delivered them to the destination. These conventional systems have
    a lacuna with respect to various features such as auditability, traceability,
    and transparency [59]. However, in the modern digital era, these features can
    improve safety and food quality, and hence, there is a huge demand of good quality
    of food by consumers [60]. Hence, most of the research & development(R&D) organizations
    adopt IoT technologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSN), and radio frequency
    identifications (RFIDs), which remotely observe the food supply-chain. According
    to Caro et al. [61], most of the centralized cloud infrastructures are being used
    as current IoT solutions in SCM. These infrastructures usually have open issues
    like data integrity, lack of transparency, tampering and single point of failure.
    These issues can be handled in an efficient way by using blockchains. Decentralized
    trustful systems can be designed for the same by using the blockchain. A decentralized,
    blockchain-based solution named AgriBlockIoT, was proposed in [61] for Agri-Food
    SPM. It integrated various IoT sensor devices which produced and consumed data
    along the chain. The stored data can be accessed, and autonomous executable smart-contracts
    could be implemented through AgriblockIoT, with the objective of achieving transparency,
    and inflexibility of the records in an environment, that uses modern devices such
    as mini-PC and gateways. The performance and efficiency of AgriblockIoT are quantified
    in terms of CPU load, network traffic, and latency. The performance can be improved
    by working on the constrained hardware architectures. Perboli et al. [62] suggested
    that the blockchain improves the reliability, efficiency, and transparency of
    supply-chain, and speedup inbound processes. Though many IoT technologies are
    used for food safety and SCM, there are some issues which are not properly addressed.
    The major issue is to decide whether the information or data shared among the
    members of other supply-chain is trustworthy or not. To overcome this issue, authors
    of [60] proposed a system called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP),
    which provided real-time food tracing information to all SCM members and has features
    like reliability, openness, neutrality, security, and transparency. Weber et al.
    [69] proposed a blockchain based decentralized solution to solve the problem of
    determining if the information or data shared among the members of the supply-chain
    is trustworthy in collaborative processes. They also discussed various notations
    and process models for business. The prototype model was implemented using blockchain
    and validated through business processes [70]. To execute business transactions
    securely, a model called business process management(BPM) was proposed by Guerreiro
    [71]. This model used the blockchain technology and an Enterprise Operating System
    (EOS). The risk involved in the secured execution of business transactions was
    eliminated in the proposed model by increasing trust, authenticity, robustness,
    and traceability against fraud. An Agricultural Supply Chain (ASC) system was
    presented in [68] by Leng et al. This system was completely dependent on the double
    chain architecture which accelerated the efficiency of the blockchain in the ASC.
    The authors suggested solutions to provide adaptive rent-seeking and matching
    mechanisms for public service platform. These solutions ensured transparency,
    security and privacy of the enterprise information. Moreover, the use of public
    service platform and the efficiency of the system were also improved. The proposed
    system had drawbacks mainly in terms of performance and increased size of the
    blockchain. Mao [72] proposed a credit evaluation system which was based on public
    blockchains. This system helped in the management and supervision especially for
    the food-supply chain to improve the effectiveness. In particular, the authors
    gathered the credit evaluation text from the traders by smart contracts on the
    blockchain, and then analyzed the text using a deep learning method named Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM). Though the authors claimed the effectiveness of their
    method, but they did not consider the overall system costs and benefits. Due to
    these issues, they can not provide a standard methodology to design, develop,
    and validate the overall blockchain solution. Later on, the authors in [62] concentrated
    on one of the most critical issues, i.e, the implementation of the blockchain
    in the supply-chain with the need of including all the different actors. Moreover,
    the sharing of information along the entire blockchain could lead to inertia in
    adopting the solution. For this reason, a correct implementation of the blockchain
    technology in the supply-chain must starts from an analysis of the needs and the
    objectives of the different actors involved. Keeping this objective in mind, the
    authors created a business model capable of highlighting the returns in terms
    of both economic and customer satisfaction. Kshetri [65] presented an early evidence
    of linking the use of the blockchain in supply-chain activities to increase transparency
    and accountability. They also examined how the blockchain is likely to affect
    the key SPM objectives such as cost, quality, speed, dependability, risk reduction,
    sustainability, and flexibility. A public blockchain of the agricultural supply-chain
    system based on the double chain architecture was proposed by Leng et al. [68].
    In this system, the authors mainly focused on the dual chain structure and its
    storage mode, resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism, and consensus algorithm.
    The results exhibited that the double chain structure based agricultural supply-chain
    could take care of the openness and security of transaction information and the
    privacy of the enterprise information. It also had the ability to complete rent-seeking
    and matching of resources self-adaptively. Therefore, the proposed architecture
    greatly enhanced the credibility of the public service platform and the overall
    efficiency of the system. Table 4 provides the detailed relative comparison of
    the existing blockchain based approaches for supply-chain & logistics systems
    using the parameters such as the transparency, reliability, security, architecture,
    consensus mechanism, traceability system, framework, pros, and cons of the existing
    approaches. TABLE 4 Supply Chain Management With Blockchain Technology B. Energy
    Domain Energy is the actual base of our existence. It is essential to the lives
    of humans and all other living organisms on earth. Humans and all the living creatures
    on the earth cannot survive in the absence of energy. We use energy for a variety
    of purposes like food, Communication, transportation, heating/cooling, and lighting.
    All conventional transportation means such as trains, buses, automobiles, and
    airplanes work on energy, which is derived from electricity, and fossil fuels.
    Our food is grown with considerable energy expenditure, and its storage and transportation
    also consume energy. Our modes of communication, such as internet and telephones
    run on electricity. Sun is the major source of all energies available on the earth.
    It is very important to select the type of energy resources carefully, because
    it can lead to adverse effects on the environment such as global warming, and
    pollution. Energy resources are classified into two categories: non-renewable
    resources and renewable resources. The exponential use of non-renewable resources
    may lead to rare existence of these resources. So, it is very important to manage
    them with intense care and proper management. Proper usage of non-renewable resources
    has become mandatory due to their scarcity. The use of renewable energy sources
    such as solar power or wind can leverage energy efficiency to maintain the ecosystem
    [84]. Hence nowadays, most of the countries encourage their people to use renewable
    energy resources for the growth of their industries, agriculture, and transportation.
    1) Distributed Energy System Distributed Energy System (DES) is one of the important
    concepts in the energy domain. DES generates power on decentralized levels. It
    also enhances the overall throughput quality of the energy system by considering
    the parameters like energy production, economics, and environment. DES overcomes
    the many challenges of the centralized energy network systems and maximizes the
    use of renewable sources for a distributed generation of energy. With the use
    of IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), DES has made it
    quite simple to monitor and maintain data and records. With its due popularity,
    DES has brought a significant improvement in the sector of electric utility which
    gives the ambit for the expansion of renewables empowered digital services. Nowadays,
    there are many evolving technologies are available which can simply convert energy
    into a digital. Using such technologies, we can keep a closer watch on a DES which
    is placed at a remote location. Moreover, the IoT plays a vital role in energy
    transitions and hence is adopted by DES. The presence of the blockchain and IoT
    facilitates a wide range of services enabled by the DES. In fact, the blockchain
    technology and IoT get the credit of giving a digital look to DES for energy transitions.
    The application of the blockchain in DES helps it to have a trustworthy data flow
    among emission traders, energy traders, energy producers, and operating staff.
    Digital DES offers a high level of security, and scope for decision making and
    processing based on the real conditions. The blockchain also helps to generate
    energy efficiently. There are numerous scenarios where energy sharing DES is more
    appropriate and better than the conventional DES. The Blockchain technology provides
    a decentralized energy trading platform for the imports and exports of energy,
    which can monitor electricity flows and aid to maintain them by time stamping
    [77]. DES is a truly intelligent system that provides a broad range of services
    in various stages such as the operating stage, development phase, energy trading
    stage, and energy metering phase. Authors of [77] did not highlight the issues
    like old grid infrastructure, reliability, energy loss, stability, environmental
    concerns, obsolete design, less efficiency in transmission, generation and distribution.
    Truby [76] described how to improve environmentally sustainable development of
    the blockchain applications. Their study was based on the fiscal policy and regulatory
    approaches for the digital currencies [54]. This research led them towards the
    proposal and establishment of some new policy tools and legal tools which are
    required for the consumption of energy with the usage of blockchain technologies.
    Authors [76] also came up with the fiscal policy for the same purpose and suggested
    the use of the blockchain technology. 2) Microgrid Small-scale power stations
    which have their own production as well as storage resources are known as microgrids.
    A microgrid always has definite boundaries. It can be perceived as a tiny cluster
    of electricity users who have a local source of electricity supply. The clusters
    are connected to a national grid which operates independently. If a microgrid
    is connected to the main grid, it is known as a hybrid microgrid. Decentralized
    Energy Resources (DER) such as diesel generators, PV Panels and a group of loads
    are integrated with Energy Storage Systems (ESS) like flywheels and batteries
    to form a microgrid and provide electricity [73]. Decentralized flexibility created
    by renewable energy sources can be easily reduced by approach, i.e, microgrids.
    Goranović et al. [85] suggested the two approaches for controlling electric grids,
    i.e, decentralized and centralized monitoring systems. In the centralized monitoring
    systems, an operator is accountable to execute the whole system. The use of centralized
    control devices needs expensive infrastructure. Centralized systems measure and
    process the data and then set proper proceeding in the circumstances. Multiple
    points can be made available in the system through which information is sent and
    received by the communication channels and centralized control devices. The major
    drawback in this mechanism is that the use of multiple points in the centralized
    system increases the probability of system failure. This limitation of the centralized
    system can be conquered by the decentralized system where each device independently
    controls itself. The decentralized system also improves the fault tolerance and
    communication speed of the system. The decentralized blockchain is precisely suitable
    to implement business processes in microgrids using smart contracts [86]. Authors
    of this paper also provided a few examples of the blockchain projects for microgrids
    with certain technical parameters. The type of the blockchain, consensus mechanism
    and availability of parts required in the hardware development or open source
    were the technical parameters considered by the authors for describing the example
    microgrid projects [85]. A brief summary of these projects is given below. PowerLedger:
    It was a blockchain based market clearing & trading mechanism [87]. It included
    the use of private Ethereum with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and public eco-chain that
    employed proof-of-Stack (PoS). This was an open source project. Share&Charge:
    It was a group of Electric Based Vehicle (EBV) charging stations [88] which used
    public Ethereum and consensus algorithm as a PoW. Owners can register his or her
    station to fix charging tariffs. Any charging station could be integrated and
    combined to Share&Charge network [73] through Share&Charge module. NRGcoin: This
    framework was based on energy cryptocurrency developed through a smart contract.
    It operated through gateways which simply calculated the flow of electricity and
    communicated through a smart contract. GrunStromJeton: It was an Ethereum based
    conceptual framework developed to verify the actual use of electricity. It used
    PoA as a consensus mechanism. SolarCoin: It was developed to enhance the mass
    production of solar energy. Due to the lengthy setup process, customers usually
    do not go for solar installations. This project aimed at eliminating this problem
    by giving rewards to buyers. One solarCoin was given as a reward per produced
    MWh. It used PoW as a consensus mechanism and bitcoin as cryptocurrency. GridSingulartiy:
    It was a decentralized data exchange framework specially designed for energy sector
    emphasizing on electricity, water, gas, and heat. In this platform, PoA and PoW
    were the consensus algorithms which used public Ethereum. Electron: It is a Company
    which works in the energy sector and provides Ethereum based better solutions.
    Apart from the above projects, people are currently working on numerous projects
    in the same domain. Table 5 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing
    blockchain-based approaches in the energy domain using parameters such as the
    objective, transparency, reliability, security, architecture, consensus mechanism,
    traceability system, framework, pros, and cons of the existing approaches. TABLE
    5 Energy Applications With Blockchain Technology C. Digital Content Distribution
    Since the commercialization of the internet in 1994, delivery services of digital
    content has been increased exponentially. [89]. Delivery systems are mainly of
    two types: non-protected and protected delivery systems. Generally, digital content
    is protected using the conventional encryption mechanism. Different encryption
    mechanisms use different ways to generate, propagate, and maintain the keys and
    decrypt the encrypted content with keys. Traditional systems such as Conditional
    Access System and Digital Rights Management (DRM) are popular for protecting digital
    content, but face some major issues like network attacks, stealing of keys, and
    pirate attacking. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional centralized system,
    the authors of [89] proposed a decentralized digital content distribution system
    based on the blockchain. In this digital content system, the owner of the actual
    content could supervise and control the security as well as simplicity. The use
    of the mining techniques ensured that the addition of each type of transaction
    to the blockchain. PoW was used as the consensus mechanism to guarantee the security
    and privacy of the transactions stored in the blockchain. Due to some open issues
    such as pirate attacking, it was not possible to entirely control this mechanism.
    Table 6 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches in the digital content distribution domain using parameters such as
    the objective, transparency, reliability, security, architecture, consensus mechanism,
    traceability system, framework, immutability of the blockchain, advantages, and
    drawbacks of the existing approaches. TABLE 6 Distribution With Blockchain Technology
    D. Toursism and Hospitality Industry Tourism is the process of spending time to
    outside station, i.e, away from our home for purposes such as business purpose,
    personal purpose, relaxation and pleasure. Serving travelers is the major functionality
    of the tourism Industry. Nowadays, most of the people search and book their traveling
    tickets, food, and lodging online with the use of the internet. Therefore, the
    worldwide usage of the internet, the tourism and hospitality industry has witnessed
    rapid changes. In this digital world, many tourism companies like Expedia Group,
    BCD Travel, Uber, Ola, and AirBnb have replaced their traditional business models
    by Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) models to achieve transparency and security in transactions.
    There is a huge demand for innovative platforms in the tourism industry, which
    can integrate technology, money, and knowledge. TUI and many other companies have
    already started using the blockchain for implementing the functionalities like
    booking tickets and making payments. Many companies like Expedia, CheapAir, Webjet,
    and One Shot Hotels use bitcoins for the travel purpose, i.e, to book and reserve
    tickets. Digital currencies simply integrate with smart contracts which have enough
    potential to develop highly disruptive technologies for the tourism industry.
    Authors of [99] suggested three prepositions which helped to highlight some open
    issues in the tourism industry. These prepositions mainly focus on the customer’s
    point of view and market implementation’s point of view. The prepositions include:
    I) New Type of evaluation as well as review techniques which can build trustworthy
    systems for rating purpose. II) The extensive adoption of digital cryptocurrencies
    for C2C markets. III) Use of blockchain leads to increase of disintermediation
    in the tourism industry. In the case study part of our paper, we try to highlight
    the above issues in the tourism industry. The detailed explanation of the same
    is available in the case studies section. E. Smart Healthcare Health is the most
    valuable asset of any nation. In traditional healthcare, all patient related data
    is stored in a centralized way and therefore, it is not advisable to give access
    of data to any untrusted third party. Moreover, the privacy and security of patient
    information must be maintained as it is vulnerable to a variety of attacks [121].
    A centralized architecture cannot fulfill these requirements completely. Hence,
    smart healthcare is introduced to deal with the above mention issues in conventional
    healthcare systems. Smart healthcare focuses on monitoring and diagnosing patients’
    health remotely through wireless communication channels. It collects the necessary
    information of various patients through heterogeneous wearable devices and sensors.
    Enormous data is collected for a large number of patients. It is a big issue to
    analyze and store this data in a secured manner. These data should also be shared
    securely among trusted parties such as hospitals, patients, doctors, and medical
    stores. Secure communication of these data is pivotal as it affects important
    decisions such as planning of new services in the hospital, recommending doctors,
    analyzing symptoms of different diseases or health issues, and improving the overall
    system to make it intelligent. Table 7 provides a detailed relative comparison
    of the state-of-the-art healthcare security standards used for smart healthcare.
    These standards are compared using the parameters such as access management, security
    maturity, reduction in cost and complexity, and improvement in healthcare compliance.
    For the various medical research activities, deciding treatments, and analyzing
    symptoms of diseases, patients’ data is required to be shared periodically. Traditional
    access control policies are not secured enough to share highly sensitive patient
    records from one party to another. Moreover, in most of the cases, patients do
    not share their medical history with the doctors. In case of a medical emergency,
    medical records of the patient are necessary, but the same is not available due
    to poor record maintenance. All the above-mentioned issues can be solved by smart
    healthcare using Electronic Health Records (EHR). Though smart healthcare is capable
    of solving the major issues in the healthcare industry, there are some challenges
    to be addressed. Access control policy for EHR, privacy, security, and availability,
    are open issues in smart healthcare. The blockchain technology can be used to
    get solutions to these issues. In fact, the blockchain has the potential to support
    smart healthcare through the distributed ledger among various users such as patients,
    doctors, medical stores, and insurance agencies. TABLE 7 Worldwide State-of-the-art
    Healthcare Security Standards Authors of [100] proposed a blockchain-based intelligent
    application commonly known as Healthcare Data Gateway (HDG). Patients can securely
    share and control their data through a secured data gateway. It processes and
    manages patients’ data without any concern about the third party. HDG consists
    of three layers namely Data Usage, Data Management, and Storage. Entities that
    use healthcare data such as physicians, companies, government, and researchers
    are associated with the data usage layer. In the data management layer, HDGs independently
    connected to each other. This layer also manages all types of metadata such as
    patients’ data, schemas, and indices information. The storage layer prevents the
    attacks on integrity and confidentiality by providing secure and scalable storage
    for the healthcare system. Azaria et al. [101] developed a decentralized MedRec
    model which was a novel data management system for large scale EHR. In this proposal,
    confidentiality, authentication, and accountability of health records were maintained
    via a comprehensive log using blockchain-based MedRec model. Authors of [102]
    developed a new architecture for the medical field especially for precision medicine
    and clinical trial. This architecture had four new components: I) Blockchain-based
    parallel and distributed computing component to examine parallel computing using
    data analytics, II) Trustworthy information sharing component to enable a trustworthy
    medical data system for collaborative research, III) Application data management
    component to maintain the integrity of data, and to integrate dissimilarity of
    medical data, IV) Verifiable unknown identity management component for maintaining
    identity privacy for IoT, person and devices as well as secured access to patient-centric
    medicine data. Authors of [103] developed a reliable healthcare system on the
    basis of Pervasive Social Network (PSN) using different protocols. The first protocol
    was an extended version of IEEE 802.15.6 display authenticated association. It
    was used to establish secured links by means of unbalanced computational requirements
    for mobile devices and resource-restricted sensor nodes. Health data was shared
    between PSN nodes with the help of the second protocol which was based on the
    help blockchain technique. The authors examined the proposed protocols and other
    factors for evaluating the performance. The proposed system demonstrated the possibility
    of using the blockchain technology, especially for PSN-based applications. Though
    the performance of the proposed system was not measured on a mass-scale healthcare
    system, i.e, PSN-based system, as stated by the authors, the performance of the
    proposed system could be improved in terms of transport and monitoring of the
    environment. Authors of [104] discussed a viewpoint on the blockchain founded
    healthcare data management system. They also bestowed a framework for sharing,
    managing EMR, especially for the patients suffering from cancer. The proposed
    architecture included a user interface as well as the backend. The backend comprised
    of the components such as membership services, certification authority, clusters
    of nodes, load balancer, and distinct cloud storages for patients’ certificates
    and data. This work substantially reduced turnaround time for EMR sharing, increased
    the power of decision making for the sake of medical care, and also reduced the
    overall system cost. The proposed system also guaranteed the availability, security,
    privacy, and access control across the EMR data. Xia et al. [105] developed a
    trustworthy blockchain-based system called “MeDShare” especially to handle the
    challenges of maintaining voluminous medical information on a cloud using big
    data for data provenance. Activities such as sharing and transition of information
    were recorded and stored in a tamper-proof manner. The authors also compared the
    performance of “MeDShare” with the existing methods of data sharing and came up
    with the conclusion that auditing and data provenance could be achieved by cloud
    service providers through the MeDShare. Risk factors of data privacy were also
    minimized through the proposed system, but issues such as scalability, data interoperability
    and key management were not highlighted in the paper. Rifi et al. [106] discussed
    the important problems such as scalability and interoperability, and highlighted
    the advantages of including the blockchain technology for medical data exchange
    to achieve the best performance. Liang et al. [107] developed a user-driven health
    information sharing solution to handle the issues of privacy and identity management.
    To address these issues, they suggested the use of the channel formation scheme
    and membership service of the blockchain. The authors also proposed a mobile-controlled
    system based on hyperledger fabric with the use of permissioned blockchains. The
    proposed work majorly focused on the validation of the network nodes, and the
    preservation of healthcare-related data. A new blockchain-based information model
    was proposed by Magyar et al. [108]. This model basically integrated complex Electronic
    Healthcare Data (EHD). The implementation of a decentralized and purely expendable
    network was possible due to the use of cryptographic tools and the blockchain.
    The model was developed by considering the basic beliefs of the HIPAA regulation
    existing in America. The proposed work ensured information availability and resolved
    the issue of data privacy at the same time, although the authors did not provide
    any algorithm or method to handle the EHD related issues such as integrity, security,
    portable user-owned data, and interoperability. Jiang et al. [110] focused on
    the fact that everyday huge number of healthcare-related data are produced by
    individuals and hospitals. This data is very beneficial in the medical industry
    for various purposes. It is quite challenging and important to store this data
    securely. It is must to have mechanisms to maintain confidentiality, privacy and
    integrity of data. By keeping these requirements in mind, the authors developed
    a BLOCkchain-based model for Healthcare Information Exchange(BlocHIE), which resolved
    the above-listed issues. In this mechanism, they considered two types of healthcare-related
    data - personal healthcare related data and electronic medical records. They performed
    analysis of various ways and requirements to share and store the healthcare related
    data. The framework was based on two blockchains which were loosely-coupled and
    one was an EMR-chain and the other was a data-chain. Different methods and techniques
    of chain verification, as well as storage, were integrated to ensure authentication
    and privacy. The authors also developed two transaction packaging algorithms such
    as TP&FAIR and FAIR-FIRST for PHRD-Chain and EMRChain respectively, which increased
    the fairness, efficiency, and system throughput among the users. These two packaging
    algorithms were evaluated in terms of throughput and fairness using the BlocHIE
    mechanism. As claimed by the authors, the FAIRFIRST algorithm increased the fairness
    and the TP&FAIR algorithm increased the throughput. Nowadays the blockchain is
    being used worldwide in the medical field to maintain and store the healthcare
    related data securely. Theodouli et al. [111] said that this data could be used
    for further innovation and research in the healthcare industry. By considering
    the needs of the healthcare industry, the authors of [111] proposed a design architecture
    for a system which can easily secure permission management and data sharing for
    the healthcare with the help of the blockchain features. The proposed infrastructure
    consisted of three layers: Web/cloud platform layer, Cloud middleware layer, and
    Blockchain network layer. As shown in the paper, this model could help to enhance
    security and integrity to a good extent. This model was also used in the KONFIDO
    project to verify the parameters such as interoperability and data exchange. According
    to the authors, and the proposed model gave additional benefit with respect to
    workflow automation, patient pseudonymity, accountability, auditing, and data
    integrity. Fig 8, gives an idea about the use of blockchain technology in smart
    healthcare. Table 8 provides a detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches for smart healthcare. Parameters used for this comparison are the objective,
    security, architecture, simulation tool or framework, hardware, and physical design,
    benefits and drawbacks of the existing approaches. TABLE 8 State-of-the-Art Blockchain
    Based Approaches to Secure Healthcare 4.0 FIGURE 8. Blockchain in smart healthcare.
    Show All F. Smartcity In smart city implementations, heterogeneous sensors are
    used by various smart devices and users to collect the required data. These data
    are processed and used in traffic management, transportation systems, waste management,
    schools, libraries, water supply networks, community services, and power plants
    to improve the performance. There is a gradual increase in the number of people
    living in city areas. Due to increased use of the Internet, big data [129], and
    IoT, the concept of a smart city has become very popular. To strengthen the development
    of the smart cities, we need effective mechanisms to solve the existing problems
    related to energy, transportation, governance, and environment. Some open issues
    such as deficient security in IoT, difficulty in maintenance and upgradation of
    equipment, maintaining the trust among the internet users, optimizing the cost
    of running data centers, damage resistance, privacy, and security need to be addressed
    to deploy smart city projects effectively and efficiently. According to the authors
    of [128], the blockchain technology is the potential of solving all these problems
    and hence, it is best suited for developing smart city solutions. As we know,
    the consumption of energy increases due to urban development. The purpose of the
    internet is to develop an intelligent energy system. Authors in [128] mainly focused
    on how the blockchain could help to solve the problems in the internet, big data,
    and IoT [15], [16]. In this research, issues such as user’s creditability, the
    creditability of the data in the central database, data privacy protection, and
    privacy protection of data were addressed. In the proposed work, the blockchain
    identified valid IoT nodes and denied the system access by malicious nodes. It
    also maintained data privacy in IoT and improved storage and computing abilities
    with the help of decentralized databases. As shown in the paper, the proposed
    work effectively prevented various attacks on the network infrastructure with
    improved recovery mechanism in big data [130]. Various architectural issues in
    the network infrastructure of the smart city were discussed by Sharma and Park
    [126]. Due to the exponential rise in information volume as well as the increase
    in the count of connected IoT devices, different issues such as bandwidth, security,
    latency, and scalability emerge in the existing smart city frameworks. To address
    these issues, authors in [126] proposed a hybrid architecture for a smart city.
    It was divided into two partitions: edge and core network through the hybrid architecture
    scheme. Moreover, this architecture was developed by considering all the strengths
    of the distributed as well as centralized architectures. In this paper, the authors
    also suggested the PoW scheme to strengthen privacy and security. They simulated
    the proposed model by evaluating feasibility and performance based on different
    performance metrics such as latency, and throughput. Authors also came up with
    a software-defined networking (SDN) and blockchain-based hybrid network architecture,
    although they did not focus on important parameters like how to deploy edge nodes,
    how to enable the caching technique at edge nodes etc. Due to this research gap,
    there is a tremendous scope of work in this domain in the near future. Biswas
    and Muthukkumarasamy [122] proposed a four-layer security based framework which
    was developed using the decentralized blockchain technology. It was integrated
    with smart devices that provided a secure and trustworthy communication model
    for a smart city. The proposed framework comprised of four layers- the physical
    layer, communication layer, database layer, and interface layer. In the physical
    layer, multiple standards were defined for smart devices using which data collected
    could be shared and integrated. The blockchain protocols were used to integrate
    with the communication layer to provide privacy and security of the transmitted
    data. The authors also suggested that the extensive use of the private ledger
    could lead to the improvement in performance, efficiency, and security for various
    real-time applications such as smart parking of vehicles, smart cleaning, smart
    home, and traffic control system in a smart city [131]. Scalability achieved by
    this framework was also up to the mark. As shown in Fig. 9, the proposed model
    had good features like fault tolerance, reliability, capability, and faster execution
    of the operation. Due to the use of the blockchain, various smart devices were
    able to communicate in a distributed environment. The major gap found in this
    paper is that the proposed model not missed to focus on some of the important
    issues like scalability and interoperability of the heterogeneous platforms. FIGURE
    9. Framework for smart city. Show All Rivera et al. [123] defined a smart city
    as the use of information technology (IT) to make the life of citizens more better
    and comfortable [125]. A smart city is a digital world which interconnects various
    areas such as government offices, schools, healthcare, colleges, and the economy.
    Nowadays, the unique identity of users is the biggest concern in business and
    smart city environments. Many researchers and developers have attempted to develop
    a reliable technology which can accurately determine the users’ identities. These
    attempts have used various attributes such as name, address, health status, hobbies,
    and credit record of the users. The digital identity is significantly important
    as it plays a vital role in security measures for interconnected devices in a
    smart city. The authors of [125] failed to highlight some of the important issues
    like smart energy, architecture, and SDN based security in the development of
    a smart city. In [124], Liao et al. focused on some important issues of smart
    cities like interoperability and transparency of various services. Due to the
    advancement in technology, fair and transparent services are demanded by the citizens
    in a smart city. Lottery game is an important segment in a smart city application,
    but it has a deficiency in terms of fairness and transparency. Therefore, the
    authors of [124] came up with an optimal solution to improve the transparency
    and fairness of a lottery system. They designed a blockchain-based transparent
    lottery system for a smart city. The authors proposed a three-layered blockchain-based
    lottery system known as FairLotto which used four lightweight protocols. Closing
    time, lottery purchase, initialization, and verifying winning numbers were the
    four different lottery stages in the proposed system. Equal possibility of winning
    the prize for each and every participant was guaranteed by this four-layered architecture.
    FairLotto effectively ensured transparency and did not store any financial transactions
    in the blockchain. Due to this, the transactional privacy was preserved and fairness
    and transparency were achieved in the lottery system. However, there was a lack
    of connectivity and service integration in the lottery system. Moreover, the authors
    also implemented Fairlotto system in Ethereum, but the results of the numerical
    analysis on the performance were not provided. These two were the major research
    gaps in the proposed work. Table 9 provides a detailed relative comparison of
    the existing blockchain-based approaches for smart city applications. We use parameters
    such as the objective, digital identity, security, architecture, smart energy,
    smart parking and automation, smart traffic, green environment, advantages, and
    drawbacks of the existing approaches for making this comparison. TABLE 9 Smart
    City Development With Blockchain Technology G. Business The Blockchain is a decentralized
    technique used for the secured exchange of cryptocurrency and financial transactions.
    Each user maintains its distributed ledger which is useful for validating a new
    transaction. Bitcoin is a medium of digital cryptocurrency that provides transactions
    in a secured and distributed environment. The group of all executed bitcoin transactions
    performed in the past is called a distributed ledger. After every successful transaction,
    an authentic user has to make changes in the distributed ledger which is distributed
    over the network and shared by all users in the network. As hash functions are
    used in the formation of the blockchain, data integrity, confidentiality, and
    privacy are maintained across all the transactions. Singh and Singh [73] discussed
    the importance of blockchain in business, banking, and financial applications.
    It has enough potential to reorganize the business market industry. Use of block-chain
    reduces the risks, cost, probability of cyber attacks in financial organizations,
    and precise auditing of organizations can be achieved. Authors simply discussed
    the use of blockchain in the business application is highly desirable and convenient,
    due to its characteristics. They did not suggest any basic architecture for a
    business application to overcome the problems of blockchain like interoperability
    and scalability. Nguyen [132] discussed that sustainable development in finance
    can be achieved through the inclusion of the secured blockchain. This technology
    could bring various benefits for the existing banking system as well as society.
    It could increase the speed and efficiency of execution, optimize the transaction
    time and networks of record keeping, reduce the cost of financial transactions,
    and improve the probable chances of accessing the financial market. Nowadays,
    still there are no complete legal rules and regulations for cryptocurrencies and
    bitcoins. Hence, the use of the blockchain is a big challenge in the payment industry.
    Rimba et al. [133] provided a comparison of cloud services and blockchains for
    Business Process Execution (BPE). Based on the experimental results, the authors
    showed that the cost of Ethereum based process execution is higher as compared
    to the cost for business process execution on Amazon SWF, but authors ignored
    to formulate a method which could estimate the execution cost depending on the
    model as well as data collected in the past. Moreover, this paper did not describe
    how to minimize latency and execution cost. Lundbak and Huth [134] discussed that
    consensus and trust could be achieved in a distributed network through the blockchain.
    Thus, many private and governmental sectors, central banks, insurance and finance
    agencies, academic institutions, and especially some startups in Europe focus
    on the implementation of the blockchain in their routine operations. Improper
    implementation of the blockchain may lead the industrial standards and agendas
    to non-secured operations. The authors of [134] devised an oligarchic approach
    to authenticate and secure business processes and data. Their approach shared
    the business data without exposing the sensible information and resolved numerous
    issues of game-theoretic mining but it was not able to prevent uncertain behavior
    such as cheating. The authors of [135] described an algorithm to ensure data confidentiality
    in an untrustworthy environment. This algorithm translated the Business Process
    Execution Language (BPEL) into a highly confidential smart contract, but this
    algorithm did not meet the basic security pillars such as data integrity, correctness,
    and authenticity. The implementation of the blockchain may help to resolve the
    above-mentioned issues. Johng et al. [136] presented a framework to improve the
    trust in business processes using the blockchain. This framework mainly focused
    on issues like transparency and immutability. It also improved the trust among
    different stakeholders. Though the framework was not capable of resolving issues
    like traceability, the authors tried to build a process meta-model for supply-chain
    through the same mechanism. An end-to-end model for Real Time Gross Settlement
    (RTGS) through hyperledger fabric blockchain platform was designed by the authors
    of [137]. The proposed system made the payment service more secure and efficient.
    It used a timestamp algorithm which resolved the problem of gridlock and the risk
    of privacy. This framework was not generic for diverse payment services. A more
    generic platform can be developed through the blockchain technology [138]. Mendling
    et al. [139] discussed the execution of business processes beyond organizational
    boundaries through the blockchain without the inclusion of any trusted third party,
    although the authors did not explain how to resolve the existing issues such as
    latency, bandwidth, throughput, and size in the proposed work. Table 10 provides
    a detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based approaches for
    the business domain. Parameters used for this comparison are Business Process
    Service(BPS), trust management, security, architecture, consensus mechanism, cost
    model, monetary policy, pros, and cons of the existing approaches. TABLE 10 Business
    in Blockchain Technology H. Internet of Things In the Internet of Things (IoT),
    various devices are connected through the internet to share useful information
    via servers for performing specific tasks or actions in the external environment
    such as measuring temperature or humidity and moving of shaft. Delivering the
    right information to the right people at the right time is possible through the
    use of IoT. Various sensors continuously sense the data and these collected data
    can be used for effective decision making. Things connected to the internet are
    expected to cross 50 billion in the near future, which is basically an approach
    of how these various devices should be designed and integrated with each other,
    so as to deliver a service delivery network, which can serve the needs in the
    future. The architecture of IoT is basically the backbone of any application and
    thus, it should be crafted carefully considering the needs of the evolution of
    functionality, scalability, availability, and maintainability. From this IoT architecture
    model, it is very clear to know that security is an essential factor in all IoT
    layers as shown in Fig. 10. FIGURE 10. IoT architecture model. Show All Nowadays,
    most of the IoT devices are not fully secured and can be easily hacked. These
    devices have restricted network capacity, limited computation power, and small
    storage capacity. Due to these characteristics, such devices are vulnerable to
    a variety of attacks as compared to computer systems. Samaniego and Deters [141]
    observed that the issues of network latency occurred due to cloud-centric IoT
    systems. To overcome these problems, they developed a software-defined IoT management
    construct known as Virtual Resources (VR). Tamper-proof, decentralized blockchains
    have the potential to solve security issues in any IoT Implementation. To use
    the blockchain as a service for the IoT, hosting environment is one of the challenges.
    Edge devices have limited computational resources as well as bandwidth, thus making
    fog or cloud as the potential hosts. The authors of [142] surveyed and categorized
    some important IoT related security challenges and requirements. The same were
    tabulated and mapped against the existing state-of-the-art solutions. The authors
    suggested the integration of the blockchain as a key solver for such challenges
    and also outlined the research issues which must be addressed in future, that
    could provide scalable, reliable, and efficient security solutions for the IoT.
    Singh et al. [143] observed that the current security technologies do not have
    the potential to secure IoT applications from various cyber-attacks in the business
    domain. They also suggested three different patterns of the blockchain-based security
    model for the IoT. There are various distributed ledger protocols suitable for
    the IoT Implementation such as hyperledger fabric, Ethereum, and Internet of Things
    Application (IOTA) [144]. In this paper, the performance of these protocols was
    compared for the development of IoT applications. The authors also presented three
    different architectures for the same. The architectures differ in the position
    of key storage and Ethereum blockchain which enhanced the security and reduced
    the network traffic. The problem with these architectures was that they were not
    capable of monitoring the IoT devices’ transactions automatically. Huh et al.
    [145] developed a new way to manage a few numbers of IoT devices with the use
    of Ethereum and computing platform. They used three Raspberry Pis, and smartphones
    and proposed three smart contracts which used public keys and signatures to track
    meter values and save the values of light bulbs and air conditioners. Malicious
    attacks on smart contracts could be detected and ignored by the computing systems
    of light bulbs and air conditioners. However, the proposed work failed to resolve
    issues such as Denial of Service (DoS) and synchronization. Moreover, the proposed
    mechanism considered a small number of IoT devices and thus was unable to implement
    a full-fledged IoT system for multiple devices. Liao et al. [146] presented various
    design issues and an architectural approach for the blockchain-based IoT services.
    Design decisions could be carried out by developers with the help of this architecture.
    Unfortunately, the proposed work failed to show the adverse effects on architectural
    attributes like robustness, efficiency, and security. Reyna et al. [147] analyzed
    the major challenges of IoT Integration such as scalability and storage capacity,
    data privacy and anonymity, and consensus mechanisms. They identified the potential
    benefits of the blockchain for the IoT and also suggested different topologies
    for the integration. Some key points to enhance the performance and feasibility
    of IoT applications with the help of the blockchain was also discussed in the
    paper. Table 11 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches for the IoT. This comparison has been done using parameters such as
    reliability, encryption, security management, edge computing, architecture, consensus
    mechanism, threat model, framework implementation, advantages, and disadvantages
    of the existing approaches. TABLE 11 Internet of Things in Blockchain Technology
    I. Manufacturing The process of manufacturing includes several elements such as
    operations management, asset management, intelligent manufacturing, planning,
    the interaction of humans and machines, performance optimization, performance
    monitoring, and end-to-end operational visibility. Li et al. [157] stated that
    the IoT has converted the conventional manufacturing processes into a smart manufacturing
    process. The IoT enabled manufacturing is far smarter and efficient than cloud
    manufacturing, as it speeds up the flow of production especially in the manufacturing
    plant, management of inventories & warehouses, and observation of development
    cycles by using IoT devices. Due to this, most of the manufacturing companies
    have invested crores of funds in the implementation of the IoT applications. The
    use of the IoT in the field of manufacturing and logistics will rise to 40 Billion
    by 2020 [162]. Due to the characteristics of the IoT such as greater energy efficiency,
    predictive maintenance, higher product quality, reduced downtime, speed, and more
    informed decisions, it has various applications in the manufacturing plants [163].
    As we know, energy is one of the largest expenses for manufacturing Industry,
    energy efficiency must be achieved which can be done through IoT based smart manufacturing.
    The authors of [159] proposed a trusted FabRec prototype, which linked physical
    devices and various computing nodes through a decentralized platform. In this
    prototype, transparency was ensured through audit trails. In the decentralized
    network, the authors developed smart contracts for the autonomous interaction
    of nodes in the absence of human involvement. The proposed architecture used a
    proof of concept linked with the nodes and physical devices and enabled smart
    manufacturing. Cloud-based manufacturing basically use the centralized networks
    which have problems such as security, flexibility, availability, and efficiency.
    To resolve such issues, the authors of [157] discussed and developed a blockchain-based
    distributed network architecture known as BVmfg. This architecture had a total
    five layers which improved the trust between the service providers and users for
    secured service sharing. The authors evaluated the performance of BCmfg a case
    study in which for fifteen end users and five service providers, scalability,
    and security were improved. Later, the authors revised their prototype and developed
    a shop floor and machine level data sharing prototype [160]. Authors used a public
    blockchain for shop level and a private blockchain for service providers through
    which important data is collected and gathered. The new prototype was level 2
    Point-to-point (P2P) network implemented through the blockchain. It handled cloud
    manufacturing challenges like security and centralization effectively. The authors
    of [158] proposed a blockchain and private cloud based manufacturing four-layer
    knowledge sharing system for Injection Mould Redesign (IMR). This work provided
    the rules and standards for the secured implementation of the system in a trusted
    environment. It also provided a knowledge sharing mechanism for the owners through
    which their data, as well as assets, could be shared securely among them. The
    system used the k- nearest neighbor retrieval method which improved the efficiency
    of the search process. The proposed model was limited to only some applications
    and not fully developed for many applications. The authors of [161] investigated
    various industrial requirements such as scalability and adaptability of the network
    with the implementation using OMNeT++ network simulator. Their approach was efficient
    up to the first fourteen participating lines and no uncertainty was identified.
    Table 12 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches for manufacturing using the parameters such as scalability, architecture,
    security, simulation/framework, smart contract, pros, and cons of the existing
    approaches. TABLE 12 Manufacturing With Blockchain Technology J. Agriculture In
    recent times, various issues related to food safety have been observed. Higher
    use of fertilizers and pesticides on agricultural products is the major concern
    in food safety. Pesticides and fertilizers residues on various agricultural products
    have caused world-wide concern [165]. Due to this, there is a huge demand for
    safe agricultural products in the market. To fulfill this demand, we need secured
    solutions for handling the perfect tracing and management of the production, wholesale,
    logistics to retail, production standards, certifications, and business reputation
    [166]. Hua et al. [164] proposed a blockchain-based agricultural tracking system,
    which was basically a decentralized system in order to solve the trust crisis
    in the domain of supply-chain. This blockchain-based agriculture platform recorded
    the information about the production, storage, transportation, processing, distribution
    and supply-chain of agricultural products for the third parties like government,
    insurance companies, customers, and banks. The platform recorded all the agriculture
    product related information on the blockchain structures, as it could involve
    different users such as companies, agencies, banks, or government to work together.
    By considering the requirements, the authors developed an agricultural traceability
    system for the same. This system considered the fertilizers, pesticides, companies,
    seeds, agricultural operations, time, and residue testing. According to the authors,
    it was a very tedious task to build a platform having a uniform structure, which
    considered all the complex information and eliminated the possibility of the redundancy
    in data. Hence, the authors designed two related structures especially for the
    basic planting information as well as for provenance records. Planting information
    included the source production information in terms of identity, species name,
    planting-time, company-name, greenhouse number, and geographical location. Provenance
    records include the details about the agricultural operations in terms of identity,
    date & time, person, digital-signature, location, operation-type, inputs & memo,
    and company. The agriculture tracking platform consisted of three components-
    data node, clients and registration center. The issues in the agriculture system
    such as creditability of data and integration the subsystems were easily handled
    by this open data-sharing platform. Due to this, any participant could view the
    data uploaded by any participating companies, which was also one of the major
    advantages of this platform. According to Tian et al. [63], food safety is the
    major concern, especially in China. As China is an agricultural country, the annual
    demand for vegetables and fruits is approximately 730 million tons [167]. Due
    to the huge demand of the market, traditional agri-food logistics are not capable
    of handling this situation. There are some open challenges in traditional agri-food
    logistic systems such as deficiency of funds and modern equipment, shortfall of
    a monitorable traceability system, moderate level of information, and unordered
    regulatory systems. Therefore, there are massive and frequent brokedown events
    of food safety in China. To overcome the limitations of the traditional agri-food
    logistic systems, the authors of [63] proposed a blockchain and RFID-based agri-food
    supply chain traceability system. This system significantly improved the quality
    and safety of food, and also reduced the probability of different losses in the
    conventional logistics process. The building process of the system included various
    stages such as production link, processing link, warehouse management link, distribution
    of cold chain link and sales link. The authors compared and analyzed the proposed
    traceability system with the traditional traceability systems using various parameters.
    The authors also discussed the advantages of using the blockchain and RFID technology
    in the proposed system. As stated by the authors, the major advantage was that
    the traceability system totally removed the necessity of the trusted centralized
    agencies and provided a data sharing decentralized platform through which all
    the users could carry out their respective operations with openness, neutrality,
    transparency, security, and reliability. Lin et al. [167] developed a blockchain-based
    traceability system, especially for food supply-chain. It stored the data of every
    node in the food supply-chain and combined all the information using blockchains.
    The authors proposed a conceptual framework for agri-food traceability system
    using Ethereum and blockchain as shown in Fig. 11. In this figure, a user can
    register with the help of the cryptographic keys and can get the information of
    the products stored on BigchainDB. FIGURE 11. A conceptual food traceability systems
    [167]. Show All Storage and management of data performed with the help of BigchainDB.
    All the users in a system such as producers, retailers, distributors, consumers,
    processors, and regulatory could check the information and modify or add the product
    from BigchainDB if they are the authentic users of the system. As per the authors,
    this RFID and blockchain-based model had a few limitations such as it did not
    have any mechanism to ensure whether the raw data collected from sensors was correct,
    whether the data scanned by the RFID tags and barcodes to scan food tracking is
    correct, i.e, anyone can tamper the sensor’s data and the absence of the blockchain
    methods to detect the same. Table 13 provides a detailed relative comparison of
    the existing blockchain-based approaches for the agriculture domain. The parameters
    used for this comparison are transparency, reliability, security, architecture,
    consensus mechanism, traceability system, framework, advantages, and disadvantages
    of the existing approaches. TABLE 13 Agriculture With Blockchain SECTION V. Open
    Issues and Challenges In this section, we highlight the open issues and challenges
    in some application domains such as healthcare, IoT, energy, business, smart city,
    agriculture, energy, and supply-chain & logistics. Fig. 12 gives a detailed taxonomy
    of the open issues in the blockchain applications. FIGURE 12. Taxonomy of open
    issues in Blockchain Applications. Show All A. Blockchain Design and Implementation
    Challenges The future of the blockchain can be decided by its safety, robustness,
    smart contract, database technology, security tokens, and changing regulatory
    environment. However, to achieve the goals, the design and implementation of the
    blockchain need to provide extreme reliability, safety, and scalability which
    rely on major technologies such as shared ledger, consensus, provenance, immutability,
    and smart contract. In this section, we outline the design and implementation
    issues faced by the traditional systems and the possible solutions by the blockchain
    technology, as shown in Fig. 13. FIGURE 13. Design and Implementation issues of
    Blockchain. Show All 1) Centralization One of the major hurdles in the traditional
    system is its centralized mechanism. Such systems are larger, more complex for
    organizations in particular. If the centralized system is getting attacked or
    compromised, all the data can leads to a different direction. In this more network
    delay and higher computing power required, so the cost is more for the server.
    The central authority having all privileges in the system that clears the transactions
    made by the users. It can be eliminated or replaced with the decentralized system,
    in that verification is done by the consensus of the different users in the network.
    2) Scalability Nowadays, we store all the transactions in the decentralized blockchain
    network to validate them. As a result of this, the blockchain becomes heavy and
    slow. There is a restriction on the size of each block and time interval required
    to create a new block. The blockchain can process only 7 to 8 transactions in
    one second, but in real time scenarios, millions of transactions execute and hence
    it is impossible to implement a blockchain for a real-time scenario which imposes
    a challenge of scalability. 3) Establishing Trust In today’s era, how to establish
    the trust is the major problem for everyone because any third party creates major
    issues with the ongoing situation or breaches the data and increases the redundancy
    which makes more difficult to trust anyone. In such scenarios, the blockchain
    can be used to prevent hampering and establishing the trust as it uses the cryptographic
    hash for building the blocks and immutable nature of the ledger. 4) Security Security
    of important data is the major concern in every organization. The security challenges
    include monitoring the cloud configuration, impact of attacks, vulnerability of
    mobile carriers, unauthorized access, and modification of data by intruders. The
    blockchain technology records the transactions using blocks which are linked together
    with the help of the cryptographic keys and immutable ledger and thus, makes it
    very difficult for attackers to modify or delete information or transactions.
    5) Cost Use of different agencies, intermediaries mostly includes various frauds,
    commission charges, and duplication of product. The blockchain eliminates the
    need of a third party and therefore, the transactions can be completed resulting
    in fewer fees [168]. Smart contracts, a component of the blockchain technology
    are self-executing and stored on the blockchains. Due to the decentralized nature
    of the system, no one can control these contracts and therefore each involved
    party can trust their validity. Because of the high level of automation in this
    technology, the companies who have adopted the blockchain technology, have experienced
    huge cost savings. 6) Transparency Different companies have their own policies,
    regulations, and tracking systems. This leads to a poor connection and less visibility
    among the customers and business. The distributed nature of the blockchain transactions
    make them public and verifiable by every user in the network with transparency
    [169]. Table 14 provides the detailed relative comparison of the design and implementation
    challenges associated with the traditional systems and the possible solutions
    by using the blockchain technology. TABLE 14 Design and Implementation Challenges
    of Existing System and Possible Solutions by Blockchain B. Open Challenges in
    Healthcare Table 15 provides a detailed relative comparison of the design and
    implementation challenges in the healthcare domain and the possible solutions
    using blockchains. TABLE 15 Open Challenges in Healthcare 1) Master Patient Indices
    Every year the volume of the healthcare related data increases and often when
    dealing with the healthcare data, records get mismatched or duplicated. Also,
    different electronic health records systems have their own data format and data
    set to enter and execute the data, which raises a need for having a standardized
    data format. Due to the use of blockchain technology, the data are cryptographically
    hashed in the ledger. The user could look for the recorded transactions which
    can have multiple records or the keys, but with the use of the blockchain technology,
    all information is linked with single patient Ids. 2) Patient Data Management
    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is known as (HIPAA) controls
    the patients’ data privacy and makes the data PHI secured, but the patients need
    to give their medical data to the third parties such as pharmacists, imposing
    the need of protecting the data. With the use of the blockchain, a hash for each
    patient’s health information in blocks which contains the patient ids is created.
    Using the blockchain network API, the disease-related data can be viewed with
    respect to the affected patient without revealing the patient’s personal information.
    In the same manner, a patient can have the privilege to decide who can view or
    access his data with a specific third party [170]. 3) Data Provenance and Integrity
    Patients’ health information, electronic health records, data collected from IoT,
    and monitoring systems are maintained by the medical facilities. Here, the main
    target is to secure the information and its sharing techniques, authorize healthcare
    facilities and its entities to confirm the correct information and ensure the
    proper services. The blockchain is more useful in such scenarios because of its
    ability to provide data integrity. The approach of the blockchain is to share
    and distribute data publicly with the secured transactions. The technique used
    by this technology is PoW with time stamping. 4) Clinical Trials Researchers working
    in various domains always want their confidential information to be stored privately
    and securely so that no unauthorized person can breach or modify or steal their
    data. In the blockchain technology, data modification is impossible with the SHA256
    algorithm that creates the unique hash values which are linked together into a
    chain. The healthcare industry needs to maintain and share the information related
    to clinical trials securely which can only be shared with authorized parties such
    as research sponsors or regulatory committees. With the blockchains, the data
    can be managed or traced with consent within multiple sites, protocols, and systems.
    Patients having proper access privileges can also access this information regarding
    their health issues and related research. 5) Drug Traceability Currently, the
    main hurdle in pharmacology is the drug counterfeiting. By the survey of the health
    researchers, it has been observed that about 10 to 30 percentage of the drugs
    in the developing countries are duplicate. The adverse effect of this is the loss
    of business and improper usage of fake drugs which can lead to severe damages
    to a person’s health. The use of the blockchain network across the drug facilities
    can detect frauds from the drug dealer. All the operations from the manufactures
    to the suppliers are contained in the blockchain network that enables to trace
    the whole route of drugs. 6) Data Enrichment Storing unstructured data can lead
    to variability, time consumption in the search process, the lack of reliability.
    Data enrichment is an operation for adding values to increase quality. Health
    records must be structured, secured, accurate, time-stamped, and easy to read.
    Following steps are required to be executed to organize the data before adding
    it to the blockchain: Replacing the patient’s identity with the public hash key,
    making it compliance-ready, adding meta information and structuring it for computation.
    Organized data enables all healthcare providers to access the data efficiently.
    C. Open Challenges in Internet of Things Table 16 provides the detailed relative
    comparison of the design and implementation challenges in the IoT and possible
    solutions by using blockchains. TABLE 16 Open Challenges in IoT 1) Architecture
    IoT ecosystems depend upon the centralized network in which all the devices are
    connected in a client-server model through the brokered communication. It uses
    the cloud server to authenticate and identify devices. It needs higher processing
    time, computation power and bandwidth. The blockchain decentralized architecture
    creates a P2P network through which messaging, file sharing and device coordination
    becomes easier. 2) Sensors’ Maintaining Issues With the increase in the number
    of devices used in IoT each year, it becomes a very problematic and challenging
    task for the manufacturers or service provides to maintain these devices on a
    daily basis. Moreover, this is a time consuming and high maintenance cost task.
    The use of blockchain technology in this domain can reduce the cost as well as
    time. 3) Centralized Databases A centralized database has a restricted computing
    power and storage capacity. There is always a large number of nodes to connect
    to the server which is a time-consuming task. It is also difficult to find faulty
    nodes in this structure. Most of the IoT devices connect with the centralized
    database and cloud network which increases the cost and computational requirements.
    In the distributed blockchain technology, nodes have minimum connectivity and
    still, the network remains reliable and safe. With distributed computing, the
    utilization of available computing power is increased for billions of transactions
    irrespective of the location of the devices. This makes the IoT more reliable
    and cost-effective. 4) Data Privacy and Security Issues If the users’ data are
    stored in a centralized database then privacy & security becomes the major concern.
    Nowadays, to earn profit, various companies store, use and sell user’s data to
    third parties without the consent of the users. Such actions compromise the privacy
    of users’ data. The blockchain technology uses a distributed database structure
    which stores data in the encrypted form and thus reduces the risk of data stealing
    and breach of privacy. 5) Device Legal Identificatin In the current era, sensor
    devices used in the IoT applications are small in size and have limited computing
    and storage capacity. Hence, such devices are vulnerable to physical attacks such
    as impersonation or spoofing. The blockchain technology uses smart contracts and
    consensus mechanism which boost the proper identity verification of the IoT nodes,
    and eliminates the unauthorized access of the active devices by unknown users.
    D. Open Challenges in Business 1) Data Privacy In today’s era, data privacy is
    one of the key challenges in the business domain, where many systems encounter
    data breaches, leak of personal information, unauthorized monitoring and eavesdropping,
    breach of access control rights, data stealing and leaking. With the distributed
    blockchain technology, data are stored in an immutable manner having secured time-stamping,
    public audit and consensus, making the system robust against privacy issues. 2)
    Backup and Disaster Recovery Storage and backup of data are very important in
    any business application. For storing and maintaining large a volume of data,
    more computing power is needed which results in the increase of the overall cost.
    Moreover, if data is maintained on a centralized system, the risk of a single
    point of failure also increases. The blockchain mechanism uses decentralized systems
    for the distributed handling of data. A clustered hierarchy is used for data storage
    and backup that eliminates the probability of losing the data. 3) Smart Contracts
    The process of contracting includes bidding, validation, and approval for enabling
    the next steps. Execution of a traditional contract may require human intervention
    which makes the involvement of a third party as a service. The same is required
    even during disputes and leads to take higher time for resources consumption,
    and the high cost of the contract. Using blockchains, smart automation is created
    without human intervention, which eliminates the involvement of third party transactions
    and unnecessary time delays. 4) Letter of Credit (LC) Payment An international
    letter of credit payment requires a purchaser and dealer and they use paper-based
    letter of credits to make transactions. In this scenario, each party needs to
    send the necessary documents via post or courier services. Due to requirement,
    time and cost involved in the process are much higher and not convenient for the
    exporters. If used in this domain, the blockchain technology has the potential
    to eliminate the time delay by providing cost-effective faster services. The blockchain
    makes the transactions transparent and integrated with the electronic bill of
    the ledger. Table 17 provides a detailed relative comparison of the design and
    implementation challenges for business applications and possible solutions by
    using blockchains. TABLE 17 Open Challenges in Business E. Open Challenges in
    Smart City Table 18 provides a detailed relative comparison of the design and
    implementation challenges in the smart city domain and the possible solutions
    with the blockchain technology. TABLE 18 Open Challenges in Smart City 1) Digital
    Identity In the current era, online services need users or clients to provide
    personal identification information before availing the services. All these data
    are stored without the knowledge of the owners and can be accessed by third parties.
    When the decentralized blockchain technology is used to implement online services,
    digital ids are created for all the users. These ids along with digital watermarking
    techniques are used while executing user transactions. This is how users’ data
    can be stored, maintained and controlled in the permissioned network having access
    rights only with the individual users. 2) Transportation Management The transportation
    business is very popular these days to provide routine services to a large number
    of customers. Providing necessary services to the customers is quite costly. The
    involvement of third parties in providing services may lead to the breach of privacy
    of users’ personal data as well as an increase in the cost of availing services.
    A decentralized blockchain network can handle all these issues effectively and
    efficiently by enabling a P2P platform for transportation services. 3) Education
    In today’s world, education institutes either private or public, do not provide
    the exact records to the government. That is why the government cannot check or
    help for literacy targets. With the inclusion of blockchain technology, educational
    records can be made available via an automated consent mechanism. This solution
    makes the information redundant and the same can be integrated with the government
    population registry so that it can handle all the literacy targets in country’s
    population. 4) Land Use Traditional registration of land or property is a very
    time consuming and costly process. The blockchain technology can eliminate the
    hurdles associated with this conventional process by creating a digital process
    of automated property registration. This solution increases the transparency and
    trust within the system and improves the economy. The newer development of smart
    cities combines the blockchain based technology for a number of processes such
    as land and property registry, getting approvals, generating inspection reports
    and recording the certificates. F. Open Challanges in Agriculture Table 19 provides
    the detailed relative comparison of the design and implementation challenges in
    the agriculture domain and the possible solutions using blockchains. TABLE 19
    Open Challenges in Agriculture 1) Outdated Record-Keeping In agriculture, all
    the information regarding foods, farmers, seller-buyer information are very outdated
    and not available to all the users. So, its very difficult to process the data
    and conduct market analysis. With the usage of blockchain network all the participants
    have the access of all record and transactions in trustworthy and secure manner.
    2) Traceability / Transparency The second open challenge in agriculture is traceability,
    which focus on the origin of the foods and its quality. But, its very difficult
    to find original and genuine products or foods in supply chain. Blockchain based
    sensor tracking system is a viable possible solution to eliminate the aforementioned
    issue. 3) Transaction Cost and Market Access Some times small scale farmers are
    not getting the whole market access in agriculture. Thus, the farmers compromised
    with higher cost with limited access to the market. With the help of distributed
    ledger technology of blockchain network, all the data are available and easily
    access to the every market on the network, which helps the all the farmers to
    connects with market and also to built trust. G. Open Challenges in Energy Table
    20 provides the detailed relative comparison of the design and implementation
    challenges in the energy domain and the possible solutions based on the blockchains.
    TABLE 20 Open Challenges in Energy 1) Energy and Environment In today’s scenario,
    we don’t have a smart grid like infrastructure, and the use of the normal infrastructures
    makes the third party intermediary problems such as VAT frauds, security issues,
    high cost, and carbon emission which can lead the environment to a very worse
    condition. With the use of blockchain technology, the development of the smart
    grid energy infrastructure is possible through which each customer can get emission
    allowance criteria for the safety of the environment. All kind of tracking and
    monitoring of energy makes it easier to build and sustain a healthy and green
    environment on the earth. 2) Inequality In the current scenario, retailers don’t
    have the grid infrastructure. So, the energy providers enable middlemen to monitor
    the electric meters and put extra burden on the customers to cover the cost of
    the middlemen and earn high profits. The blockchain technology helps to eliminate
    the middlemen energy retailers so that the consumers can trade the energy and
    also buy it, directly from the smart grid. It has been observed that the consumers
    can reduce the energy bill by 38%. 3) Peer-to-Peer Trading Energy trading has
    involved intermediaries or brokers so far. They charge their fees for every trading
    process and act as a link between energy generators and consumers. Energy trading
    takes place at the power exchanges and over the counters. The blockchain P2P network
    created in the smart grid infrastructure helps directly exchange the energy to
    one another without involving brokers and paying them unnecessary costs. The overall
    process becomes cost-effective and easy for customers. 4) Energy Meters Currently,
    the use on energy meters creates dependency on middlemen monitoring. It also increases
    the amount of billing and makes the overall process tedious. Smart meters can
    be used for quick implementation of the process and monitor the correct energy
    usage. This eliminates the dependency of meter monitoring by middlemen at a great
    extent. The users can avail the required load and power with the use of blockchain-based
    microgrids energy. H. Open Challenges in Supply-Chain & Logistics 1) Counterfeiting
    In today’s world, every industry has issues of counterfeiting of products and
    drugs. This creates issues like poor customer satisfaction with quality, unverifiable
    products or fake products. All these make the overall trust and reputation of
    companies or manufactures to go down. The blockchain technology lessens the distance
    between customers and companies and makes the processes more transparent. It stores
    tamper proof tracking history of the products which makes it difficult to counterfeit
    the products. 2) Authenticity In today’s world, users rely on the documents to
    check products’ or services’ validity and originality. But such documents can
    easily be tempered. The blockchain technology provides a secure way to maintain
    the information about the supply chain to avoid any kind of modification or breaching
    of data. This technology enables the clients and suppliers to trace the origin
    as well as movements of the products. With the use of RFID tags attached to the
    vehicles, it becomes possible to trace the products along with timestamps. 3)
    Provenance Tracking Every industry and company has dependencies on the supply
    chains. It is very difficult to track every record in transit even in multinational
    companies. The need for transparency leads to the increased cost and clients’
    relational issues which can weaken the brand or company value. A blockchain-based
    supply chain can maintain all the necessary records and their tracking details
    easily with the help of the embedded sensors. This kind of precise tracking can
    help to identify any fraud that occurs anywhere in the supply-chain. 4) Inefficiency
    Although contemporary supply-chains can handle the complexities of manufacturing
    processes, they are still extremely slow, expensive, and inefficient. When each
    supplier and manufacturer have their own infrastructure, tracking products in
    real time is difficult in a fragmented system. Product delivery delays are usually
    caused by the lack of access to up-to-date data. This can be mitigated using the
    blockchain technology, which increases the supply-chain efficiency while speeding
    up the time to market. Table 21 provides the detailed relative comparison of the
    design and implementation challenges in the supply chain and logistics and the
    possible solutions based on the blockchain. TABLE 21 Open Challenges in Supply-Chain
    & Logistics SECTION VI. Case Studies In order to demonstrate the use of blockchains,
    we have tried to implement the blockchain technology for two different applications:
    smart farming and tourism & hospitality. The blockchain is one of the greatest
    inventions of this decade and it has taken the whole world by a storm. Nowadays,
    the blockchain has become a popular technology due to its properties such as decentralization,
    improved security, replication, irreversibility, time-stamping and cryptography.
    In this paper, we have discussed the use of the blockchain technology for a variety
    of applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply chain & logistics,
    energy sector, IoT, smart city, business, manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism
    & hospitality. We have also discussed various open issues and challenges associated
    with different applications. A. Smart Farming In this case study, we provide insights
    into the current issues associated with smart farming and how they can be resolved
    by implementing the blockchain mechanism. Here, we present blockchain-based smart
    farming and mentioned role & functionality of different users in smart farming.
    In smart farming, various issues related to food safety, food integrity, transaction
    cost, and food traceability need to be considered. Extensive use of fertilizers
    and pesticides on agricultural products is the major concern in food safety. Pesticides
    and fertilizers residues on various agricultural products have drawn the attention
    of many countries. [165]. This has leveraged the demand for safe agricultural
    products in the market. To handle this demand, we need a perfect tracing and management
    system for ensuring food safety during each process of production and supply [166].
    All these issues in smart farming can be handled with the help of the proposed
    architecture shown in Fig. 14. In this architecture, different stakeholders such
    as farmers, crop insurance agencies, feed manufacturers, food producers, food
    manufacturers, retailers, and consumers are considered. Farmers have various functionalities
    such as farm management through the analysis of soil/crop health, crop-livestock
    management through agricultural robots, financial services management based on
    the entities like transaction costs, the safety of crops by sensors and insurance
    agencies. Feed manufacturers take the raw data from the oil-seed-crusher and mineral
    suppliers. They provide inputs to the food processor, through which the food is
    manufactured, and then sent to the customer across the chain of the food distributors
    & retailers. To maintain the food safety, transparency & food traceability and
    minimum transaction cost, our proposed blockchain-based architecture uses a distributed
    network which establishes and maintains all the transactions in a secured manner.
    FIGURE 14. A blockchain based smart farming. Show All B. Tourism & Hospitality
    In this case study, we highlight the current issues in the tourism industry and
    show how they can be resolved by implementing the blockchain mechanism. We present
    a case study that follows the process model shown in Fig. 15 Recently, many tourism
    companies like Expedia Group, BCD Travel, Uber, Ola, and AirBnb have replaced
    their conventional business models by C2C models to achieve transparency and security
    in transactions. There is a huge demand for innovative platforms in the tourism
    industry to integrate technology, money, and knowledge. There are many companies
    like TUI which has already started using blockchains for ticket booking transactions.
    Many companies like Expedia, CheapAir, Webjet, and One Shot Hotels have started
    using bitcoins for their transactions. Digital currencies simply integrate with
    the smart contracts which have enough potential to develop highly disruptive technologies
    for the tourism industry. Generally, customers take the help of online reviews
    of different tourism products to make a decision. They think that all the reviews
    of real travelers are honest and true, but actually, most of the tourism & hospitality
    industry players, (i.e. Hotels, Travel agencies, or restaurants) use centralized
    platforms to store and maintain these reviews. Through such centralized storage
    platforms, user reviews can be manipulated and modified very easily by different
    agencies for their own profit. FIGURE 15. A blockchain based tourism framework
    Show All There is a frequent involvement in the exchange of money in the tourism
    industry across the country to another party where they do not have any past business
    relationship. For such exchanges, customers generally take the help of the trusted
    third parties. Every time, a trusted third party tries to maintain a secured exchange
    of money. For providing this service, the trusted third party takes a commission.
    The need of involving third parties in the transactions can be avoided by the
    inclusion of cryptocurrencies in the blockchain technology for the exchange of
    money. We can create a new platform for C2C transactions in markets for tourism
    products. So, in our case study, we have suggested the use of a blockchain-based
    decentralized online customer review system to resolve the above issues. All the
    current issues in the tourism industry could be resolved with the help of our
    proposed architecture. In this architecture, users, travel agencies and hotels
    are the different categories of tourism industry users. Here, we use the blockchain
    decentralized network and cryptocurrencies through which the users can book tickets.
    Thus, the trusted third parties and commission charges by them can be avoided.
    All the transactions are maintained through blocks with unique identities which
    eliminates the creation of duplicate or fake online reviews. SECTION VII. Conclusion
    In this paper, we provide insights to the readers about the importance of the
    blockchain technology for various smart applications, where security remains paramount.
    This survey is divided into five parts. The first part discusses the traditional
    security systems, background, and history of the blockchains. The second part
    describes the basic architecture of the blockchain technology, including the verification
    of each transaction in the distributed network which makes a permanent, verified
    and unalterable nature of ledger for the information or data. Moreover, the blockchain
    reference architecture which consists of three different networks such as public
    network, cloud network and enterprise network. The Third part of our paper focuses
    on the real-time deployment of the blockchain for various applications such as
    smart healthcare, smart farming, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism&
    hospitality, energy, agriculture, digital content distribution, smart city, IoT,
    and manufacturing which are also considered in the survey part of the paper. The
    fourth part emphasizes on the open issues and challenges in Industry 4.0-based
    smart applications and suggests some blockchain based solutions for those applications.
    Finally, to demonstrate the suitability of the blockchain technology for smart
    applications, the last part of our paper illustrates case studies on two application
    domains: smart farming, and tourism & hospitality. We plan to explore the feasibility

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: This study aims to explore the current status,
    potential applications, and future directions of blockchain technology in supply
    chain management. A literature survey, along with an analytical review, of blockchain-based
    supply chain research was conducted to better understand the trajectory of related
    research and shed light on the benefits, issues, and challenges in the blockchain-supply-chain
    paradigm. A selected corpus comprising 106 review articles was analyzed to provide
    an overview of the use of blockchain and smart contracts in supply chain management.
    The diverse industrial applications of these technologies in various sectors have
    increasingly received attention by researchers, engineers, and practitioners.
    Four major issues: traceability and transparency, stakeholder involvement and
    collaboration, supply chain integration and digitalization, and common frameworks
    on blockchain-based platforms, are critical for future orientation. Traditional
    supply chain activities involve several intermediaries, trust, and performance
    issues. The potential of blockchain can be leveraged to disrupt supply chain operations
    for better performance, distributed governance, and process automation. This study
    contributes to the comprehension of blockchain applications in supply chain management
    and provides a blueprint for these applications from the perspective of literature
    analysis. Future efforts regarding technical adoption/diffusion, block-supply
    chain integration, and their social impacts were highlighted to enrich the research
    scope. Topic relevance of block-supply-chain literatures over time. Grey background

    a proliferation of research, projects, and discussions regarding distributed ledger
    technology (DLT) has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners.
    The reason lies in the characteristics that DLT may deliver promising disruption
    to the current model of trust, which has long created operational pain points
    of centralized systems. Traditional business operations rely heavily on a centralized
    authority or third parties, such as banks, to promote trust among participants
    [1], [2]. However, they have often been the targets of malicious attacks, malfunction
    and artificial alterations. The emergence of blockchain technology may bring about
    a rethinking of the design of business operations by virtue of its distributed
    and decentralized characteristics [3]. Blockchain, a DLT, refers to a consecutive
    list of time-stamped records (usually digital transaction data) sequentially linked
    using cryptography. A peer-to-peer network of participating nodes contribute to
    the formation and validation of blockchain and manages distributed consensus by
    network majority. This makes blockchain an immutable, secure, and trustless model
    where transactions among parties are concerned. Blockchain technology has the
    potential to rebuild the way businesses conduct their operations [1], [4]. Several
    use cases have been investigated using the concept of blockchain, which could
    function as a distributed database without third parties. Several research endeavors
    regarding trade finance [5], medical record management [6], voting [7], and insurance
    industries [8] have improved the visibility of blockchain. Supply chain management
    (SCM) is one of these potential applications [9]–[13]. Growing efforts have been
    devoted to the study of blockchain technology and its applications across various
    sectors [9]. The scope of this research ranges from technical discussion [14],
    [15], application feasibility [16], business operations [4], to even legal issues
    [17] and user acceptance [18]. Gathering information from 106 articles, including
    journal and conference papers published in a variety of sources during the period
    2016 to early 2020, this study presents illustrative topics related to blockchain
    evolution in the recent decade. The major research methods adopted in these studies
    have also been reported to outline the relationship between the main topics and
    methodologies. Among extant literature, research regarding the application of
    blockchain technology in supply chains is rather fragmented and diverse in topics
    [19], [20]. This phenomenon indicates a promising research interest but less-organized
    comprehension among the literature distribution. While researchers presented their
    early efforts regarding blockchain-based supply chain literature, there was a
    lack of qualified peer-reviewed articles that could be aggregated and analyzed
    in the current research’s limited time frame. In [19], the first blockchain-related
    supply chain literature survey was conducted prior to January 2018 under scientific
    rigor with a peer-reviewed process. The authors also collected several blockchain
    trial pilots to demonstrate their contributions, and suggested second-round surveys
    to capture the rapid development of blockchain technology in the realm of SCM.
    Similarly, another study in the same-period [20] highlighted examples of blockchain-SCM
    integration while reporting the scarcity of related studies in leading journals
    and databases. In this study, the researchers highlighted the early adoption of
    blockchain in the electric power industry with a relatively mature understanding
    of blockchain-SCM integration. Both these papers reviewed only a few studies before
    2018, i.e., 29 and 27 papers, respectively. These initial literature reviews are
    not adequate for providing a general overview, and a literature update is required
    due to the rapid proliferation of blockchain-based supply chain research from
    year 2018 to early 2020. Unlike the aforementioned review articles, this current
    work aims to provide a more holistic analysis of scenarios of blockchain use in
    supply chains by supplementing academic research for the past two years. Since
    blockchain with its unique features allows more streamlined business processes
    [21], [22], and enhanced transparency and trust among stakeholders, exploring
    its applications in supply chains is important for both academics and practitioners.
    We also realize the need for reporting the current status and potential of blockchain
    and its emerging applications across different industries in the SCM context.
    In this regard, we proposed certain questions to develop the logical connection
    between relevant extant articles and the potential for further research. The research
    questions in this study are as follows: RQ1:What are the main topics and subjects
    of interest in supply chain studies that utilize blockchain technology; how do
    they address its core issues; and how have these topics evolved over time? RQ2:What
    are the main research methodologies employed in blockchain-based supply chain
    literature and how are they related to the main topics? RQ3:Which blockchain-supply-chain
    papers were most instrumental in driving the development of literature thus far?
    To answer these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review (SLR) to
    gain insights regarding correlated issues. The aim of using SLR was to present
    a general overview of recent research by conducting a systematic analysis of extant
    literature. Thus, we outline the understanding regarding the research path based
    on our comprehension of related research interests and topic distributions. This
    paper contributes to the understanding of blockchain applications in the field
    of SCM by exploring various research topics and directions for future research.
    The literature analysis highlighted several potential research areas that may
    point out certain research gaps for future study. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows. Section II describes the basic knowledge regarding blockchain
    and smart contracts. Section III presents the methodology and procedural steps
    utilized in this review and Section IV reports findings from the analysis of literature.
    Section V identifies the main research issues, challenges, and implications, before
    the final conclusion is presented in Section VI. SECTION II. Preliminaries A.
    Blockchain Nakamoto [23] proposed the concept of a decentralized digital currency,
    Bitcoin, supported by a decentralized payment system. Decentralization refers
    to an operating mechanism that allows peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange or transactions
    without centralized authorities. This disruptive innovation eliminates the heavy
    reliance on powerful third parties. Blockchain is the technology underpinning
    the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which is a consecutive growing list of blocks, wherein
    each block records encrypted transactional data and may have further potential
    for other decentralization purposes [24]. The operating nodes in this kind of
    collaborative network have a duplicate record of transactional information, known
    as a “ledger.” Inherently shared by participating nodes, DLT provides the opportunities
    for a trustless operating environment without traditional trusted authorities
    such as banks and clearing houses. P2P exchange facilitates trust building among
    participating nodes and the shared ledger is maintained by nodes in the network.
    Computer nodes comply with an encrypted protocol to verify updated data in the
    shared ledger. This kind of distributed ledger system harvests the benefits of
    decentralized governance which may solve the issue of information exposure and
    accountability [25]. This inherent attribute favors the interactions between counterparties
    in the context of business operations [26]. Critical information could be maintained
    without checking the consistency of individual data and every single node possesses
    a duplicate of transactional data, thereby enhancing the transparency and visibility
    of business activities. In a supply chain context, this kind of system and operational
    scheme may provide a better foundation of trust as well as benefits resulting
    from the absence of a centralized authority and intermediation [12]. Accordingly,
    blockchain could further be utilized to record the ownership of assets [27], permissions,
    and activity logs. This improves the traceability of information, cash, and process
    flows, and thus provides timely tracking of products and services. The different
    types of blockchain are public, private, and consortium (or federated) blockchains,
    each of which could be applied in certain scenarios to gain better advantages
    and for effectiveness. B. Smart Contracts Smart contracts are programmable protocols
    that allow the execution of contract terms and agreements. The concept was first
    proposed by Szabo [28], who defined a smart contract as “a computerized transaction
    protocol that executes the terms of a contract.” Thus, smart contracts can be
    deployed to a blockchain database and users can develop computer codes based on
    contractual clauses [29]. Contracts are executed when certain preset conditions
    are met. Smart contracts may outperform traditional contracts due to advantages
    such as allowing the mitigation of intermediaries among transacting counterparties
    and the facilitation of transaction flows without malicious alterations and tampering
    [30]. Smart contracts can be deployed on blockchain platforms in terms of scripts
    and stored with specific addresses for functional calls similar to those performed
    in other programmable computer languages [31]. They may facilitate data-driven
    interactions in the blockchain network and further allow applications to meet
    supply chain objectives. Smart contracts are essential in the use of blockchain
    applications. A potential use case for smart contracts is in SCM. For example,
    a comprehensive paper-based process of administrative auditing may hinder the
    overall performance of a supply chain. Regulated conditions and agreements can
    be coded in smart contracts to avoid fraud, theft or other managerial risks. When
    smart contracts are deployed in the blockchain network, they are transferred to
    each connected node. Latest changes recorded in the local database may in turn
    trigger the conditions prescribed in computer codes to execute related process
    flows or notifications [32]. This is referred to as an event-driven mechanism,
    which can be facilitated without interference from a single entity. Typical use
    cases include conditioned payment transactions [33], [34], and asset and proprietary
    transfers [35]. With data updates and an event-driven mechanism, smart contracts
    may facilitate the manipulation of supply chain activities [36]. For example,
    commercial pilots, such as IBM and Maersk, recently announced their successful
    adoption of blockchain technology and smart contracts for shipment tracking and
    facilitating trade finance. Traditional paper-based procedures dealing with the
    collection and presentation of commercial documents could be significantly mitigated
    with the use of smart contracts [37]. This technology can reduce transaction costs
    and the number of involved intermediaries, and improve trade efficiency to achieve
    process automation. Smart contracts on a blockchain-based platform can have applications
    in various fields; however, previous studies have reported certain unresolved
    issues with respect to technical and legal concerns [38]. For example, contract
    vulnerabilities with regard to transaction-ordering and timestamp dependence,
    mishandled exceptions, re-entrance, and callstack issues [39]. To pursue a wider
    spectrum of applications, more research endeavors must focus on solving validation/verification
    issues [40], enhancing security and privacy, and contract-based integration with
    other technologies [41]–[43]. Smart contracts may facilitate obligation execution
    and process automation among parties based on technical openness, however, its
    long-term development still requires a cross-disciplinary approach, combining
    technological, economic, and legitimation practices. SECTION III. Methods To answer
    the research questions, we conducted an SLR to gain further insights into the
    relationship, integration, and development of blockchain technology in the realm
    of SCM. SLR is a kind of review genre that places strong emphasis on utilizing
    a series of standard processes to search, screen, analyze, and review literature,
    along with providing comments or suggestions. Since blockchain and its affiliated
    technology, i.e., smart contracts, have only emerged in the past decade, related
    works, technological standards, and innovative applications are still in their
    nascent stages. We selected the latest four years, 2016~2019 (extended to early
    2020), as the time span of this literature survey to capture the most updated
    usage of these technologies in SCM. This study followed previous research guidelines
    to construct a robust and replicable study [44]–[46]. Additionally, to explore
    and analyze as many extant studies related to blockchain and supply chain as possible,
    we searched the IEEE Xplore, ACM, Google Scholar, and other major digital libraries
    from various academic publishers, using the following search string shown in Fig.
    1. In this study, literature search and screening involved the following steps
    (Fig. 1). FIGURE 1. Procedural steps of the selection protocol. Show All A. Step
    1: Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Article selection was conducted by setting inclusion
    and exclusion criteria prior to analysis to extract highly-relevant literature.
    In this research, we focused on keywords related to the emerging blockchain technology
    and its extended concept, smart contracts, in the field of SCM to identify relevant
    articles. Considering the essence of blockchain, more general synonyms or terminologies,
    such as DLT and “decentralized ledger system” (DLS), were included. After employing
    these procedures, we obtained a total of 433 articles. Meanwhile, exclusion criteria
    were set to exclude ambiguous articles not highly correlated to the key topics.
    In this research, we included some conference articles and proceedings to extend
    the scope of literature. However, preliminary studies in the form of technical
    reports, comments, editorial, and consulting papers, were excluded to ensure quality,
    consistency, and academic rigor. B. Step 2: Title and Abstract Examination Based
    on the results of keywords identification and screening procedures, we examined
    the title and abstract of each selected article by each author. To assure quality
    and academic rigor, content of abstracts with less focus on major topics or with
    less concrete findings/contributions to the body of knowledge were removed. We
    double-checked our process to maintain coherence in article selection. In this
    stage, we excluded 294 papers that focused mainly on the applications of other
    emerging technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, industry
    4.0, machine to machine (M2M), and radio frequency identification (RFID), etc.
    C. Step 3: Full Text Reading and Finer Selection To better align the research
    questions with the contents of the selected papers, we conducted a full text reading
    and perform the procedure for finer selection of candidate papers. We removed
    33 papers from the selection as they were less relevant to our main focus. In
    this final step, we obtained 106 papers for this study. Fig. 1 illustrates the
    procedural steps for paper selection and presents the selection criteria or main
    actions conducted to filter for the most related articles. Additionally, to better
    comprehend of the selected corpus, we conducted a preliminary descriptive analysis
    to determine answers for the research questions. We classified the selected papers
    according to their topics and research methods to respond to RQ1 and RQ2. We also
    conducted a citation analysis to provide evidence for RQ3. A number of frequently-cited
    supply chain articles based on blockchain and smart contract technology were examined
    to obtain a better understanding of the research interest and its applications.
    The following sections provide explanations for the literature classification
    and related analyses. SECTION IV. Result A. Descriptive Analysis of the Corpus
    Fig. 2 displays the distribution of the sources of the selected review articles
    and illustrates the proliferation of blockchain research in the field of SCM in
    the last 3 years. This indicates the potential and opportunities for this emerging
    technology in various facets of supply-chain-related issues. Blockchain was coined
    and introduced around 2008, from then on, research has focused on cryptocurrencies,
    e.g., Bitcoin, along with their security and privacy issues. The development and
    evolution of such technologies have moved from their original financial applications
    to other areas in the following years. During the period 2008~2015, due to the
    technical essence of blockchain, related publications were scattered in the form
    of technical forums, consulting reports, news reviews, or comments. Since 2016,
    blockchain and its applications have drawn the attention of engineers, scholars,
    and practitioners. For example, the special topic conference entitled “The 2018
    international conference on blockchain” focused on the discussion of applications
    of blockchain technology and smart contracts in various sectors, including supply
    chains. FIGURE 2. Paper distribution by year of publication. Show All Assorted
    but fragmented peer-reviewed journals contributed around 89% of the selected articles,
    while IEEE, ACM and other topic-related conferences accounted for the rest. Fig.
    3 presents the popular journals for blockchain-related publications, which include
    IEEE Access, International Journal of Information Management, Future Generation
    Computer Systems, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, International
    Journal of Production Research, Sustainability, Computers & Industrial Engineering,
    etc. Originally designed for solving the double spending issue of digital currency,
    blockchain applications were first used mainly in the financial sectors rather
    than others, such as supply chain, medical records, and information systems. Additionally,
    we discovered a growing demand for papers in 2018 and expect double or triple
    the amount of publications in 2019 and 2020. The growing numbers of conferences
    and special sections regarding blockchain-related supply chain publications in
    recent years have resulted in an increasing research interest in this field. Due
    to the proliferation of blockchain-related conferences held in recent years, we
    excluded conference papers from the year 2019, but selected a few frequently-cited
    conference papers for the literature analysis. FIGURE 3. Journal/conference publications
    and number of papers published. Show All B. Classification of Selected Papers
    To answer RQ1 and determine corresponding research methods for RQ2, we classified
    the selected papers in terms of supply-chain-centric topics to identify the research
    foci and examine the potential influence of and emphasis on blockchain in supply
    chain applications [47]. The classification of selected paper is presented in
    Table 1 with a brief description of related topics. A considerable number of papers
    covered traceability/transparency issues and the influence of blockchain technology
    in the supply chain context. Similar efforts highlighted the potential of blockchain-based
    supply chain applications in diverse sectors, prototype system design [48]–[50],
    and a combination of other emerging technologies. We noticed that each paper may
    have referred to more than one topic to better respond to the scope of the selected
    papers. TABLE 1 Article Topics Classification For better objectivity, we conducted
    a two-stage review for paper classification. We independently classified the selected
    papers into a grouping list. Next, we performed a cross examination to extract
    common opinions regarding research topics, finely adjusting for topic headings
    after the discussion. Subsequently, we conducted a random check using the previous
    classification to ensure less disagreement and to present more stable final decisions.
    Table 2 presents potential blockchain applications across different industries
    showing that early applications were mainly in the fields such as food provenance
    [51], physical distribution and logistics [52], manufacturing [53], [54], and
    drug/pharmaceuticals supplies [55]–[57]. Traceability [58] and transparency [59]
    issues are increasingly drawing more attention, and this phenomenon explains the
    penetration point where blockchain could be applied in SCM. We also found early
    evidence that these applications may cover various sectors such as the chemical
    [60], construction [61], [62], airline [63]–[65], and manufacturing [66], [67].
    TABLE 2 Topic Classification in Various Industries The most addressed topics were
    divided into four categories: (1) traceability and transparency, (2) general influence/overview,
    (3) blockchain applications in agriculture or other industries, and (4) physical
    distribution and logistics (Fig. 4). The results of our topical discussion were
    reasonable since the major focus of the research interest and proposed solutions
    began with the pursuit of major supply chain objectives. We also found complementary
    interactions with emerging technologies such as IoT [68], RFID [69], [70], [71],
    NFC, etc., which are considered critical to streamlining supply chain flows/activities
    and real-time response. FIGURE 4. Papers classified by topic. Show All C. Analysis
    of the Relevance of the Topics Over Time Blockchain-related studies can be chronically
    divided into four-year intervals to examine the evolution in research topics.
    In this sense, we could further illustrate the relevance of research topics through
    an evolutional timeline. Before 2016, blockchain discussions mainly focused on
    Bitcoin or other digital currencies. Therefore, technical applications of blockchain
    in SCM were not significantly investigated. Fig. 5 illustrates topic relevance
    over time with the gray area denoting new topics. In the first period (year 2016),
    only few papers were published, and as expected, supply chain traceability and
    transparency were the first topics discussed. A few applications focusing on agricultural
    products were presented as templates. In the second stage (year 2017), it was
    apparent that growing attention had been granted to the discussion of blockchain
    integration with other emerging technologies, general influence of blockchain,
    the essence/design of the ledger system and smart contracts, and security/privacy
    issues. Simultaneously, the focus on the previous stage’s research topics increased
    both in amount and in depth. More publications that explored traceability and
    transparency were presented and there was also a growing interest in practical
    applications among various industries. FIGURE 5. Topic relevance over time. Note:
    Grey background refers to new topics compared to previously listed ones. Show
    All In 2018, based on the extension of topics covered in the previous stage, academic
    efforts were increasingly devoted to blockchain security and privacy, distributed
    ledger technologies, and smart contracts. We also learned that blockchain applications
    in various sectors, e.g., manufacturing, were drawing more attention from technical
    engineers, practitioners, and scholars. Additionally, more papers in the four-year
    period investigated blockchain innovation from the perspective of business process
    reengineering (BPR). In 2019, an explosive interest in various topics, such as
    blockchain-enabled physical distribution and logistics [72], business process
    management, information sharing, business operations [73], [74], and risk analysis
    [75], [76], dramatically emerged. Specifically, empirical studies focusing on
    blockchain acceptance/adoption [77], [78] appeared to further provide evidence
    for previous technological forecasts, business models, and proto-concepts [79].
    D. Main Research Methodologies Employed and the Relationship With Main Topics
    We followed a similar method of topic grouping to classify research methodologies.
    Two classification lists were generated and then discussed to diminish disagreement
    in the final version (Fig. 6). FIGURE 6. Research methods adopted in the corpus.
    Show All Since blockchain is an emerging information technology, few studies utilized
    quantitative methods. Instead, we found more descriptive papers using case studies,
    proof of concept (POC), theory building, and literature reviews, etc. It should
    also be noted that there was a number of papers that explored blockchain’s technical
    issue by system design, code/algorithm analysis, and simulation. Table 3 summarizes
    the connection between research topics and methods. We observed that various methods
    were adopted when discussing blockchain applications. Since blockchain is in its
    early development phase, quantitative methods were rarely used in prior research.
    Few studies used questionnaires and interviews [80] to collect data for qualitative
    rather than quantitative analysis [18], [81]. TABLE 3 Topics and Methods Used
    in the Corpus Qualitative methods were widely used to describe, predict, and propose
    blockchain opportunities in the supply chain context while quantitative methods
    were utilized to evaluate or analyze the performance of various blockchain-based
    systems. Case studies and comparative analysis have frequently been used to explore
    the potential influence of blockchain-based supply chains, security and privacy,
    and applications in various sectors. Several of the selected papers, from a technical-oriented
    perspective, utilized a blockchain-based system design and proposed conceptual
    frameworks for future system implementation. Some papers included coding segments
    to enhance understanding, and experimental simulations to assess the performance
    of blockchain-based systems. Some authors developed questionnaires and conducted
    interviews to assess the influence, acceptance, and performance of improvements
    in supply chain traceability/transparency due to blockchain. Very few papers conducted
    literature reviews due to the lack of adequate relevant literature. Additionally,
    some papers focused on the validation and evaluation of prototypes while few paid
    attention to blockchain-supply-chain theory building. Thus, most research studies
    adopted system design, case studies, or descriptive analysis to verify the effectiveness
    and potential of innovative blockchain-supply-chain projects/systems and associated
    conceptual frameworks. E. Citation Analysis Table 4 summarizes 12 frequently-cited
    documents (10 journal articles and two conference papers) in the corpus. To answer
    RQ3, we selected several typically-cited papers, categorized them, and provided
    complementary research findings for them. This selected list offers an outline
    of related topics about how blockchain may be applied in supply chains. Earlier-published
    papers may have been cited more frequently compared to more recent publications.
    TABLE 4 List of Frequently Cited Documents in the Corpus Early research focused
    on the examination and prediction of blockchain-enabled improvements on supply
    chain traceability and transparency [82], [83]. For example, Tian [84], [85] developed
    frameworks combining blockchain with RFID and the IoT. These papers serve as references
    for other applications in various industries, especially the agricultural sector
    [86], [87], [88]. Later, research interests moved toward the discussion of blockchain
    system design [89], security and privacy issues [90]–[93], credit evaluation [94],
    and governance [95], [96]. Evidence from pilot studies has urged scholars to examine
    blockchain’s role in meeting SCM objectives [97]. Researchers have asserted that
    areas, such as extended visibility and traceability, supply chain digitalization
    and disintermediation, improved data security and smart contracts, are worthy
    of further study [19]. We suggest that a second-run SLR must be conducted to include
    more emerging research efforts regarding the various supply chain applications
    of blockchain. SECTION V. Discussion Blockchain, with its unique characteristics,
    has received growing attention from engineers, researchers, and practitioners
    in the last decade. Through a series of explorations and implementations of several
    pilot projects in various sectors, blockchain technology has found practical applications
    from both academic and practical perspectives [98]–[101]. To answer the research
    questions in this paper as well as provide a better understanding of future blockchain
    developments, we attempted to bridge the gap in extant knowledge regarding blockchain
    applications and future research work with the findings from our literature review.
    The major research issues for the achievement of supply chain objectives are elaborated
    and discussed as follows. A. Traceability and Transparency Traceability and transparency
    have long been critical issues in supply chain activities. Typical pain points
    include critical intermediaries, process hand-offs, over-centralized business
    operations, etc. Blockchain, as a distributed shared ledger technology, may help
    increase traceability and extend supply chain visibility by its consensus mechanism
    and shared ledger. Every single node participating on a blockchain platform collaboratively
    maintains and validates transaction records in the common ledger. The major players,
    including suppliers, manufacturers, shippers, distributors, and customers, have
    duplicated transactional records and access permission to monitor the progress
    of process flows [102]. These inherent characteristics greatly reduce the need
    for trusted centralized authorities, allowing for immutable transactions and improved
    efficiency in supply chain activities. From the results we reviewed, we can note
    that nascent blockchain-based supply chain studies focus on the discussion of
    its potential to improve traceability and transparency [103]. Industrial pilots
    such as Provenance, Walmart, and Everledger have illustrated the capability to
    improve the visibility of physical movement, asset transfer, and quality assurance.
    The integration of blockchain and emerging technologies, such as the IoT and advanced
    sensing technology, will enable improved real-time monitoring of logistics activities
    [104]. By introducing better disclosure of supply chain activities and improving
    accountability across supply chain players, blockchain may mitigate disputes among
    businesses. With its immutable attributes, the distributed ledger system also
    reduces the need for reconciliation among traditional siloed databases. In this
    sense, stakeholders may capture value and alleviate risks when conducting transactions.
    Moreover, smart contracts may facilitate process automation and provide better
    real-time monitoring of product/service visibility [105]. The design of smart
    contracts aims to achieve the functional demands of supply chain stakeholders.
    While trust is often weak among unfamiliar trading parties, blockchain may leverage
    its advantages to create value in supply chain activities. A blockchain ledger
    system may also provide authenticity verification of property or documents via
    digital signatures or other encrypted measures, which increases security and averts
    counterfeit [27], [71]. Enterprises may benefit from the reduced processing of
    paper-based documents as well save the considerable costs involved in tracking
    and obtaining proof of information authenticity. Accordingly, an improved supply
    chain working scheme with better traceability and transparency, less intermediation,
    and process automation is attainable when making blockchain transactions with
    counterparties. Moreover, blockchain’s distributed governance and transparency
    attributes may also provide solutions to malicious alterations in a centralized
    system. B. Stakeholder Involvement and Collaboration Joint participation of supply
    chain actors can enhance the overall performance of a blockchain ecosystem [106],
    [107]. From a systemic perspective, blockchain may leverage its potential through
    a large-scale collaboration of stakeholders as supply chain friction mainly stems
    from dispersed disconnection among parties [108]. However, blockchain may not
    be a panacea as certain challenges and barriers still remain in the further adoption
    of blockchain technology [109]–[111]. First, the willingness of supply chain stakeholders
    dominates the level of employment as blockchain-based architecture is still in
    its nascent stages. Some unsolved technical issues include transaction throughput,
    scalability, security and privacy, block capacity, and power consumption issues.
    Supply chain participants are accustomed to the trust mechanism supported by centralized
    authorities and have less confidence in the effectiveness of a distributed trustless
    paradigm. Cultural mindset and extant business processes need to be changed before
    blockchain adoption. Second, activities for business process redesign and migration
    need to be well planned. The successful establishment of a blockchain-based operating
    environment requires coordination among the legacy databases of various parties
    [75], [112]. Firms have to choose appropriate types of blockchain applications
    and scholars have reported several judging criteria for reference. For example,
    a private blockchain is suitable for an intra-organizational context as it has
    a higher level of centralization and security. Public blockchains are open to
    public participation without permission while a consortium blockchain provides
    mid-level of decentralization. Researchers have addressed the importance of establishing
    a governance model, considering blockchain configuration and operations among
    stakeholders. Additionally, information sharing and system interoperability are
    key concerns for blockchain architectural design [113], [114]. C. Supply Chain
    Integration and Digitalization Blockchain has the technical capability to play
    a critical role in information sharing [115], [116], value/property transfer,
    and trust provision [108]. The way in which supply chain partners achieve strategic
    and business objectives using blockchain technology relies on the integration
    of business processes with the type of blockchain employed. From a value-creation
    perspective, blockchain enables the incorporation of a new business model [117]
    with disruptive innovation [118] and different levels of disintermediation, which
    allows for better transparency, security, privacy, and becomes a driving force
    of cooperation among untrusted parties. Blockchain-based financial applications
    grant a dramatic reduction on transaction costs with re-engineered processes since
    a synchronized ledger may significantly enhance the level of overall efficiency
    [119]. For example, researchers have suggested a blockchain-based letter of credit
    process, which may greatly improve efficiency in global trade context [16], [37].
    Digitalization of physical properties and intelligence rights may be the next
    stage of development in blockchain application [19]. Digitalization allows the
    transfer of value across a distributed ledger system due to blockchain’s capability
    for maintaining data integrity [120], free from malicious tampering and cyber-attacks
    [121]. Blockchain networks could also facilitate the transmission of digitalized
    stakes [122] and provide validation of document authenticity, which can mitigate
    transactional disputes. Moreover, blockchain and smart contracts facilitate process
    flows and improve the efficiency of payment transfers and settlements. Smart contracts,
    serving as digitalized protocols, could enable the tracking of supply chain events
    and document flows, which can streamline business operations and facilitate the
    execution of business logic. Therefore, supply chain digitalization is expected
    to promote stakeholder involvement in achieving common objectives. D. Common Frameworks
    and Blockchain-Based Platforms In a blockchain-based platform, smart contracts
    play a crucial role in connecting business logic and process execution in supply
    chain activities. For example, event-driven mechanisms are widely adopted when
    designing smart contract communications [37], [123]. Programmable codes are utilized
    to allow triggers when supply chain activities change states. For example, smart
    contracts trigger corresponding notifications to supply chain stakeholders when
    certain preset conditions are met, such as goods arrival, payment received, or
    shipping documents approved. Trial pilots with a variety of blockchain platforms
    have been devoting efforts to realize the better performance of supply chain flows.
    Typical examples and platforms that have been widely adopted by financial organizations
    are Ethereum, Hyperledger, R3 Corda, Ripple, Wave, etc. Different rationales dominate
    blockchain-based architectural designs, and various blockchain applications in
    supply chain activities demand joint collaborations among participating actors
    [124]. The findings we reviewed show that blockchain system planning and design
    is scenario-oriented [125]. We may take international trade supply chain as an
    example to shed light on the selection criteria for blockchain type and platform.
    When oriented toward disclosing information to the general public, a public chain
    with permissionless accessibility is preferable to improve the visibility of front-end
    workflow. Ethereum provides public chain settings for supply chain customers to
    trace physical asset provenance, authenticity and logistics status [126]. Conversely,
    local trade dealing with internal processes, services, and transactions may require
    the adoption of a permissioned private chain. Hyperledger may deploy at enterprise
    private network for sensitive information sharing and exchange in trade context.
    In an international trade setting, a consortium chain deployed between public
    and private chains could leverage its mediating role to facilitate transaction
    validation and the governance structure of grouped stakeholders [37]. The dominant
    players in a consortium chain play predefined roles, and its semi-decentralized
    structure may facilitate business operations in preferred-access control and authority
    administration [127]. While R3 Corda, as a platform targeting financial applications,
    may support trade finance and with capability to administer agreements and contracts,
    Ripple focus on facilitating monetary and payment transactions among trade counterparties.
    Wave’s pilot demonstrates blockchain’s potential uses in electronic document submission
    which greatly result in huge reduction on transaction cost and document transmission.
    The aforementioned blockchain platforms are applicable to different supply chain
    use cases, and researchers may also conduct comparisons of industrial pilots to
    understand how their features help achieve supply chain objectives [128]. The
    formation of a common framework may orient the level of participation since the
    greatest concern for supply chain players is how the framework distributes value
    to each entity and what value does the business capture within the blockchain
    ecosystem. Interactions among stakeholders and the sustainability of blockchain
    networks are essential for future blockchain development [129]. For example, a
    consortium blockchain framework may predominantly allocate governance to a specific
    group of leading enterprises [130]. These players act as value distributors and
    may orient the operations of permission control, credit evaluation, and regulation
    design. Participating entities may comprise suppliers, distributors, public sectors,
    and financial service providers. A sound framework with an efficient value-distributed
    ecosystem can extend both the technical and social influence of a blockchain framework.
    E. Theoretical Contributions and Research Implications In this literature review,
    we reexamined recent blockchain studies in the SCM context. Several studies focus
    on the general fact that blockchain may disrupt traditional supply chain practices.
    Many studies adopted the perspective of transaction cost [131]. Blockchain, as
    a shared distributed ledger, has the potential to mitigate trust issues among
    stakeholders, which in turn could alleviate business frictions, improve the visibility
    of supply chain activities, as well as the significant manipulations of human-
    and paper-based administration. With blockchain’s digital ledger, participants
    can enjoy the timeliness of information transmission among entities. In this regard,
    enterprises can harvest this benefit by reducing the costs of information-related
    searching, bargaining, and policing [130]. Additionally, smart contracts can enhance
    the level of automation by facilitating the operation and execution of business
    processes, as seen in the system designs of the reviewed articles. Based on the
    principal agent theory, the use of smart contracts may improve the interactions
    and relations among supply chain participants, i.e., the principals and the agents
    in various value-chain-related industries. A collaborative framework, based on
    assorted blockchain platforms, can mitigate issues of information asymmetry through
    better control of contract execution and supervision. Blockchain-based business
    models in the supply chain ecosystem have been less discussed in the extant literature
    [132], while the need for holistic evaluation from supply chain practitioners
    remains strong. This phenomenon may be because blockchain development is still
    in a nascent stage and certain technical challenges remain unresolved. Based on
    the findings we reviewed, researchers have focused more on the improvement of
    disparate processes and business performance than the overall examinations of
    how blockchain adopters may derive economic gains from value creation and revenue
    strategies. Future research on managerial issues should address the perspective
    of resource allocation and network collaboration. This theoretical work may help
    analyze, elaborate, and forecast the impacts of blockchain in supply chain management.
    This paper has identified key research topics and the methodologies required to
    explore blockchain in the supply chain field. However, operational challenges
    such as how to determine whether blockchain adoption is required remain at the
    discretion of managers and practitioners. The use of blockchain should be carefully
    considered in terms of product (or service) characteristics, alternative surrounding
    technologies, and a firm’s supply chain strategies. As the challenges of migrating
    from a legacy system to blockchain-based applications may influence the adopter’s
    incentives, a careful consideration of implementation costs, technical limitations,
    barriers to entry, economic benefits, difficulties across multi-tier actors, and
    regulative compliance should be conducted before a final decision is made. In
    this study, Table 2 reports blockchain applications in potential industries while
    Table 3 summarizes the topics and methodologies adopted by researchers. The positioning
    of this research with its adopted methodologies contributes to the understanding
    of blockchain by providing an overview of blockchain research and highlighting
    the distribution of and gaps in extant literature. Only a few extant works of
    research have been devoted to large-scale adoption surveys from the perspectives
    of cost analysis, trade-off considerations, implementation difficulties, and relational
    impacts with supply chain actors. Work on blockchain’s impact on multi-tier networks
    and the diversity of implementation strategies in various business sectors is
    still scarce. This presents promising areas for future research. Academic researchers
    can devote their efforts on less-explored fields, while practitioners could conduct
    empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of blockchain-supply-chain adoption
    or implementation [133], [134]. Based on previous review studies, this work synthesizes
    and analyzes research contributions from recent published literature to highlight
    that blockchain can reform the traditional paradigm of supply chain operations
    and develop a more sustainable environment for the overall supply chain ecosystem
    [129], [135]. Finally, the call for supply chain incumbents to deliver blockchain
    promise based on its disruptive features may further harvest tangible benefits.
    More research efforts focusing on empirical evidence when adoption, technological
    usability, and solutions to business long-term uncertainties, are required to
    fill research gaps and guide managerial practices. SECTION VI. Conclusion and
    Future Work This article aimed to provide a systematic review and analysis of
    extant literature focusing on SCM from a blockchain and smart contract perspective.
    Efforts to use these emerging technologies to innovate supply chain applications
    have fragmented research into focusing on various topics. Research efforts are
    evolving from technological studies, prototype architecture design, to a rather
    diverse focus on industrial applications, managerial implications, and social
    impact. To date, we are conscious of the research motivation of not only the pursuit
    of specific supply chain objectives but also for more open collaborative networks,
    autonomy, and distributed governance. The main contribution of this study is a
    systematic review of extant studies and citation analysis to provide a better
    understanding about the trajectories and applications of such technologies. Nevertheless,
    future work must address several blockchain-related technical issues such as throughput,
    security, scalability, and interoperability. Similar efforts are limited and related
    quantitative study regarding these topics is still rare. More research work needs
    to address the diffusion of blockchain technology, BPR, and their managerial implications
    and social impact. Promising areas for blockchain applications and research include
    the logistics, medical, insurance, and public sectors. We expect this study to
    provide an overview of extant blockchain-related supply chain research and shed
    light on potential research gaps and directions for future works. Authors Figures

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The paradigm of
    Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world, where many of our daily
    objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order
    to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among
    other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against
    attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by
    blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper,
    a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order
    to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing
    the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with
    the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered
    IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are
    detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment
    of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim
    of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will
    have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is expanding at a fast pace and some reports [1] predict that IoT devices
    will grow to 26 billions by 2020, which are 30 times the estimated number of devices
    deployed in 2009 and is far more than the 7.3 billion smartphones, tablets and
    PCs that are expected to be in use by 2020. Moreover, some forecasts [2] anticipate
    a fourfold growth in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) connections in the next years (from
    780 million in 2016 to 3.3 billion by 2021), which may be related to a broad spectrum
    of applications like home automation [3], transportation [4], defense and public
    safety [5], wearables [6] or augmented reality [7], [8]. In order to reach such
    a huge growth, it is necessary to build an IoT stack, standardize protocols and
    create the proper layers for an architecture that will provide services to IoT
    devices. Currently, most IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm,
    connecting to cloud servers through the Internet. Although this solution may work
    properly nowadays, the expected growth suggests that new paradigms will have to
    be proposed. Among such proposals, decentralized architectures were suggested
    in the past to create large Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
    [9]–[11], but some pieces were missing in relation to privacy and security until
    the arrival of blockchain technology. Therefore, as it is illustrated in Figure
    1, in the last years pre-IoT closed and centralized mainframe architectures evolved
    towards IoT open-access cloud-centered alternatives, being the next step the distribution
    of the cloud functionality among multiple peers, where blockchain technology can
    help. FIGURE 1. Past, present and future IoT architectures. Show All Blockchain
    technologies are able to track, coordinate, carry out transactions and store information
    from a large amount of devices, enabling the creation of applications that require
    no centralized cloud. Some companies like IBM go further and talk about blockchain
    as a technology for democratizing the future IoT [12], since it addresses the
    current critical challenges for its massive adoption: Many IoT solutions are still
    expensive due to costs related to the deployment and maintenance of centralized
    clouds and server farms. When such an infrastructure is not created by the supplier,
    the cost comes from middlemen. Maintenance is also a problem when having to distribute
    regular software updates to millions of smart devices. After Edward Snowden leaks
    [13], [14], it is difficult for IoT adopters to trust technological partners who,
    in general, give device access and control to certain authorities (i.e., governments,
    manufacturers or service providers), allowing them to collect and analyze user
    data. Therefore, privacy and anonymity should be at the core of future IoT solutions.
    Lack of trust is also fostered by closed-source code. To increase trust and security,
    transparency is essential, so open-source approaches should be taken into account
    when developing the next generation of IoT solutions. It is important to note
    that open-source code, like closed-source code, is still susceptible to bugs and
    exploits, but, since it can be monitored constantly by many users, it is less
    prone to malicious modifications from third parties. Blockchain technology has
    been growing at an astounding pace over the past two years. As reported by Statista
    [15], investments by venture capitalists in blockchain start-ups rose from 93
    million to 550 million U.S. dollars from 2013 to 2016. Furthermore, the market
    for blockchain technology worldwide is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars
    by 2021. According to McKinsey & Company, although it is still in a nascent stage,
    blockchain technology may reach its full potential within the next 4 years based
    on its current pace of evolution [16]. In addition, as of writing, there are over
    1,563 digital coins [17], just a few years after Bitcoin [18], the cryptocurrency
    that originated the blockchain, was born. Bitcoin is a digital coin whose transactions
    are exchanged in a decentralized trustless way combining peer-to-peer file sharing
    with public-key cryptography. Public keys are alphanumeric strings formed by 27
    to 32 characters that are used to send and receive Bitcoins, avoiding the necessity
    of making use of personal information to identify users. One feature that characterizes
    Bitcoin is miners, who receive coins for their computational work to verify and
    store payments in the blockchain. Such payments, like in any other currency, are
    performed in exchange of products, services or fiat money. This paper is not aimed
    at detailing the inner workings of Bitcoin, but the interested readers can find
    good overviews on how Bitcoin works in [19]–[21]. The use of cryptocurrencies
    based on blockchain technology is said to revolutionize payments thanks to their
    advantages respect to traditional currencies. Since middlemen are removed, merchant
    payment fees can be reduced below 1% and users do not have to wait days for transfers,
    receiving funds immediately. Modern cryptocurrencies can be divided into three
    elements [19]: blockchain, protocol and currency. It must be indicated that a
    coin can implement its own currency and protocol, but its blockchain may run on
    the blockchain of another coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum [22]. For instance, Counterparty
    [23] has its own currency and protocol, but it runs on the Bitcoin blockchain.
    In the case of a cryptocurrency, the blockchain acts as a ledger that stores all
    the coin transactions that have been performed. This means that the blockchain
    grows continuously, adding new blocks every certain time intervals. A full node
    (a computer that validates transactions) owns a copy of the whole blockchain,
    which also contains information about user addresses and balances. If the blockchain
    is public, in can be queried through a block explorer like Blockchain.info in
    order to obtain the transactions related to a specific address. Therefore, the
    key contribution of blockchain is that it provides a way to carry out transactions
    with another person or entity without having to rely on third-parties. This is
    possible thanks to many decentralized miners (i.e., accountants) that scrutinize
    and validate every transaction. This contribution allowed the Bitcoin blockchain
    to provide a solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem [24], since it is able
    to reach an agreement about something (a battle plan) among multiple parties (generals)
    that do not trust each other, when only exchanging messages, which may come from
    malicious third-parties (traitors) that may try to mislead them. In the case of
    cryptocurrencies, this computational problem is related to the double-spend problem,
    which deals with how to confirm that some amount of digital cash was not already
    spent without the validation of a trusted third-party (i.e., usually, a bank)
    that keeps a record of all the transactions and user balances. IoT shares some
    common problems with cryptocurrencies, since in an IoT system there are many entities
    (nodes, gateways, users) that do not necessarily trust each other when performing
    transactions. However, there are several aspects that differentiate IoT from digital
    currencies, like the amount of computing power available in the nodes or the necessity
    for minimizing the energy consumed in devices powered with batteries. Therefore,
    this paper studies such similarities and analyzes the advantages that blockchain
    can bring to IoT despite its current practical limitations. Moreover, the main
    Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) architectures and improvements that have already proposed
    are reviewed. Furthermore, the most relevant future challenges for the application
    of blockchain to IoT are detailed. Other authors have previously presented surveys
    on the application of blockchain to different fields. For instance, in [25] it
    is provided an extensive description on the basics of blockchain and smart contracts,
    and it is given a good overview on the application and deployment of BIoT solutions.
    However, although the paper provides very useful information, it does not go deep
    into the characteristics of the ideal BIoT architecture or on the possible optimizations
    to be performed for creating BIoT applications. Another interesting work is presented
    in [26], where the authors provide a generic review on the architecture and the
    different mechanisms involved in blockchain, although it is not focused on its
    application to IoT. Similarly, in [27] and [28] different researchers give overviews
    on blockchain, but they emphasize its application to different Big Data areas
    and multiple industrial applications. Finally, it is worth mentioning the systematic
    reviews presented in [29] and [30], which analyze the sort of topics that papers
    in the literature deal with when proposing the use of blockchain. Unlike the reviews
    previously mentioned, this work presents a holistic approach to blockchain for
    IoT scenarios, including not only the basics on blockchain-based IoT applications,
    but also a thorough analysis on the most relevant aspects involved on their development,
    deployment and optimization. It is also the aim of this work to envision the potential
    contribution of blockchain for revolutionizing the IoT industry and confront today
    challenges. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
    the basics of blockchain technologies: how they work, which types exist and how
    to decide if it is appropriate to make use of a blockchain. Section III presents
    the most relevant BIoT applications. Section IV reviews critical aspects to be
    optimized in a blockchain in order to adapt it to an IoT application. Section
    V describes the main shortcomings of current BIoT applications and outlines the
    primary technical challenges they face. Section VI identifies further medium-term
    challenges and proposes recommendations for IoT developers. Finally, Section VII
    is devoted to conclusions. SECTION II. Blockchain Basics A blockchain is like
    a distributed ledger whose data are shared among a network of peers. As it was
    previously mentioned, it is considered as the main contribution of Bitcoin, since
    it solved a longer-lasting financial problem known as the double-spend problem.
    The solution proposed by Bitcoin consisted in looking for the consensus of most
    mining nodes, who append the valid transactions to the blockchain. Although the
    concept of blockchain was originated as a tool for a cryptocurrency, it is not
    necessary to develop a cryptocurrency to use a blockchain and build decentralized
    applications [31]. A blockchain, as its name implies, is a chain of timestamped
    blocks that are linked by cryptographic hashes. To introduce the reader into the
    inner workings of a blockchain, the next subsections describe its basic characteristics
    and functioning. A. Blockchain Basic Functioning In order to use a blockchain,
    it is first required to create a P2P network with all the nodes interested in
    making use of such a blockchain. Every node of the network receives two keys:
    a public key, which is used by the other users for encrypting the messages sent
    to a node, and a private key, which allows a node to read such messages. Therefore,
    two different keys are used, one for encrypting and another for decrypting. In
    practice, the private key is used for signing blockchain transactions (i.e., to
    approve such transactions), while the public key works like a unique address.
    Only the user with the proper private key is able to decrypt the messages encrypted
    with the corresponding public key. This is called asymmetric cryptography. A detailed
    explanation of its inner workings is out of the scope of this paper, but the interested
    reader can obtain further details in [32] and [33]. When a node carries out a
    transaction, it signs it and then broadcasts it to its one-hop peers. The fact
    of signing the transaction in a unique way (using the private key) enables authenticating
    it (only the user with a specific private key can sign it) and guarantees integrity
    (if there is an error during the transmission of the data, it will not be decrypted).
    As the peers of the node that broadcasts the transaction receive the signed transaction,
    they verify that it is valid before retransmitting it to other peers, thus, contributing
    to its spread through the network. The transactions disseminated in this way and
    that are considered valid by the network are ordered and packed into a timestamped
    block by special nodes called miners. The election of the miners and the data
    included into the block depend on a consensus algorithm (a more detailed definition
    of the concept of consensus algorithm is given later in Section IV-D). The blocks
    packed by a miner are then broadcast back into the network. Then the blockchain
    nodes verify that the broadcast block contains valid transactions and that it
    references the previous block of the chain by using the corresponding hash. If
    such conditions are not fulfilled, the block is discarded. However, if both conditions
    are verified successfully, the nodes add the block to their chain, updating the
    transactions. B. Types of Blockchains There are different types of blockchains
    depending on the managed data, on the availability of such data, and on what actions
    can be performed by a user. Thus, it can be distinguished between public and private,
    and permissioned and permissionless blockchains. It is important to indicate that
    some authors use the terms public/permissionless and private/permissioned as synonyms,
    what may be coherent when talking about cryptocurrencies, but that is not the
    case for IoT applications, where it is important to distinguish between authentication
    (who can access the blockchain; private versus public) and authorization (what
    an IoT device can do; permissionless versus permissioned). Nonetheless, note that
    such distinctions are still in debate and the definitions given next might differ
    from others in the literature. In public blockchains anyone can join the blockchain
    without the approval of third-parties, being able to act as a simple node or as
    miner/validator. Miners/validators are usually given economic incentives in public
    blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin [34]. In the case of private blockchains,
    the owner restricts network access. Many private blockchains are also permissioned
    in order to control which users can perform transactions, carry out smart contracts
    (a concept defined later in Section III) or act as miners in the network, but
    note that not all private blockchains are necessarily permissioned. For instance,
    an organization can deploy a private blockchain based on Ethereum, which is permissionless.
    Examples of permissioned blockchains are the ones used by Hyperledger-Fabric [35]
    or Ripple [36]. It can also be distinguished between blockchains aimed exclusively
    at tracking digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin) and blockchains that enable running
    certain logic (i.e., smart contracts). Moreover, there are systems that make use
    of tokens (e.g., Ripple), while others do not (e.g., Hyperledger). Note that such
    tokens are not necessarily related to the existence of a cryptocurrency, but they
    may be used as internal receipts that prove that certain events happened at certain
    time instants. As a summary, the different types of blockchains are depicted in
    Figure 2 together with several examples of implementations. FIGURE 2. Blockchain
    taxonomy and practical examples. Show All C. Determining the Need for Using a
    Blockchain Before delving into the details on how to make use of a blockchain
    for IoT applications, it must be first emphasized that a blockchain is not always
    the best solution for every IoT scenario. Traditional databases or Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DAG) based ledgers [37] may be a better fit for certain IoT applications.
    Specifically, in order to determine if the use of a blockchain is appropriate,
    a developer should decide if the following features are necessary for an IoT application:
    Decentralization. IoT applications demand decentralization when there is not a
    trusted centralized system. However, many users still trust blindly certain companies,
    government agencies or banks, so if there is mutual trust, a blockchain is not
    required. P2P exchanges. In IoT most communications go from nodes to gateways
    that route data to a remote server or cloud. Communications among peers at a node
    level are actually not very common, except for specific applications, like in
    intelligent swarms [38] or in mist computing systems [39]. There are also other
    paradigms that foster communications among nodes at the same level, as it happens
    in fog computing with local gateways [40], [41]. Payment system. Some IoT applications
    may require to perform economic transactions with third parties, but many applications
    do not. Moreover, economic transactions can still be carried out through traditional
    payment systems, although they usually imply to pay transaction fees and it is
    necessary to trust banks or middlemen. Public sequential transaction logging.
    Many IoT networks collect data that need to be timestamped and stored sequentially.
    Nonetheless, such needs may be easily fulfilled with traditional databases, especially
    in cases where security is guaranteed or where attacks are rare. Robust distributed
    system. Distributed systems can also be built on top of clouds, server farms or
    any form of traditional distributed computing systems [42]. The need of this feature
    is not enough to justify the use of a blockchain: there also has to be at least
    a lack of trust in the entity that manages the distributed computing system. Micro-transaction
    collection. Some IoT applications [43], [44] may need to keep a record of every
    transaction to maintain traceability, for auditing purposes or because Big Data
    techniques will be applied later [45], [46]. In these situations, a sidechain
    may be useful [47]. However, other applications do not need to store every collected
    value. For example, in remote agricultural monitoring, where communications are
    expensive, it is usual to make use of IoT nodes that wake up every hour to obtain
    environmental data from sensors. In such cases, a local system may collect and
    store the data, and once a day it transmits the processed information altogether
    in one transaction [48]. Figure 3 shows a generic flow diagram that allows for
    determining the type of blockchain that is necessary depending on the characteristics
    of an IoT system. FIGURE 3. Flow diagram for deciding when to use blockchain in
    an IoT application. Show All SECTION III. BIoT Applications Blockchain technology
    can be applied in many fields and use cases. Swan [19] suggested that blockchain
    applicability evolution started with Bitcoin (blockchain 1.0), then evolved towards
    smart contracts (blockchain 2.0) and later moved to justice, efficiency and coordination
    applications (blockchain 3.0). Regarding smart contracts, they are defined as
    pieces of self-sufficient decentralized code that are executed autonomously when
    certain conditions are met. Smart contracts can be applied in many practical cases,
    including international transfers, mortgages or crowd funding [49]. Ethereum is
    arguably the most popular blockchain-based platform for running smart contracts,
    although it can actually run other distributed applications and interact with
    more than one blockchain. In fact, Ethereum is characterized by being Turing-complete,
    which is a mathematical concept that indicates that Ethereum’s programming language
    can be used to simulate any other language. A detailed explanation on how smart
    contracts work is out of the scope of this paper, but the interested reader can
    find a really good description in Section II.D of [25]. Beyond cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts, blockchain technologies can be applied in different areas
    (the most relevant are shown in Figure 4) where IoT applications are involved
    [29], like sensing [50], [51], data storage [52], [53], identity management [54],
    timestamping services [55], smart living applications [56], intelligent transportation
    systems [57], wearables [58], supply chain management [59], mobile crowd sensing
    [60], cyber law [61] and security in mission-critical scenarios [62]. FIGURE 4.
    BIoT applications. Show All Blockchain can also be used in IoT agricultural applications.
    For example, in [63] it is presented a traceability system for tracking Chinese
    agri-food supplies. The system is based on the use of Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) and a blockchain, being its aim to enhance food safety and quality, and
    to reduce losses in logistics. Other researchers focused on managing IoT devices
    through a blockchain [64]. Such researchers proposed a system able to control
    and configure IoT devices remotely. The system stores public keys in Ethereum
    while private keys are saved on each IoT device. The authors indicate that the
    use of Ethereum is essential, since it allows them to write their own code to
    run on top of the network. Moreover, updating the code on Ethereum modifies the
    behavior of the IoT devices, what simplifies maintenance and bug corrections.
    The energy sector can also be benefited from the application of a blockchain to
    IoT or to the Internet of Energy (IoE) [65]–[67]. An example is detailed in [68],
    where the authors propose a blockchain-based system that allows IoT/IoE devices
    to pay each other for services without human intervention. In the paper it is
    described an implementation that shows the potential of the system: a smart cable
    that connects to a smart socket is able to pay for the electricity consumed. In
    addition, to reduce the transaction fees of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the
    researchers present a single-fee micro-payment protocol that aggregates several
    small payments into a larger transaction. Healthcare BIoT applications are found
    in the literature as well. For instance, in [69] it is presented a traceability
    application that makes use of IoT sensors and blockchain technology to verify
    data integrity and public accessibility to temperature records in the pharmaceutical
    supply chain. This verification is critical for the transport of medical products
    in order to ensure their quality and environmental conditions (i.e., their temperature
    and relative humidity). Thus, every shipped parcel contains a sensor that transfers
    the collected data to the blockchain where a smart contract determines whether
    the received values remain within the allowed range. Another healthcare BIoT application
    is detailed in [70], where it is presented the architecture of a blockchain-based
    platform for clinical trials and precision medicine. It is also worth mentioning
    the work described in [71], which presents a generic smart healthcare system that
    makes use of IoT devices, cloud and fog computing [72], a blockchain, Tor [73]
    and message brokers. IoT low-level security can also be enhanced by blockchain
    technology. Specifically, it can be improved remote attestation, which is the
    process that verifies whether the underlying Trusted Computer Base (TCB) of a
    device is trustworthy [74]. This verification can be performed by managing the
    TCB measurements obtained by using ARM TrustZone [75] and a blockchain, where
    they are stored securely. Other already proposed BIoT applications are related
    to smart cities [76] and industrial processes [28]. In the case of [76] it is
    proposed a framework that integrates smart devices in a secure way for providing
    smart city applications. In [28], different blockchain-based industrial applications
    are reviewed, including their connection to Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. Finally,
    it should be mentioned that Big Data can be leveraged by blockchain technology
    (i.e., to ensure its trustworthiness), so some researchers [27] reviewed the main
    blockchain-based solutions to gather and control massive amounts of data that
    may be collected from IoT networks. SECTION IV. Design of an Optimized Blockchain
    for IoT Applications Blockchain technologies can bring many benefits to IoT, but,
    since they have not been devised explicitly for IoT environments, the different
    pieces that make them up should be adapted. In order to optimize them, several
    authors studied BIoT performance in different scenarios. They analyzed a number
    of influential aspects, but they mainly focus on the performance of consensus
    algorithms. An example of performance evaluation is detailed in [77]. Specifically,
    the paper analyzes whether the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus
    algorithm (described later in Section IV-D) could be a bottleneck in networks
    with a large amount of peers. Actually, the tests described make use of up to
    100 peers that interact with a blockchain based on IBM’s Bluemix. The experiments
    measure the average time to reach a consensus and it can be observed how it grows
    as the number of peers increases. The scalability of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Byzantine
    Fault Tolerance (BFT) based consensus methods is compared in [78]. The author
    points out that, although Bitcoin has been a clear success, its poor scalability
    makes no sense today, since there are modern cryptocurrency platforms like Ethereum.
    In the paper it is suggested to improve PoW performance by mixing it with a BFT
    protocol. In addition, it is stated that the implementation of the consensus protocols
    in hardware is probably the most promising way for improving the performance of
    any consensus method. Besides the consensus algorithm, other elements of the blockchain
    can be adapted to be used in IoT networks. Thus, in the next subsections the different
    parts of a blockchain are analyzed in order to determine possible optimizations.
    A. Architecture The architecture that supports a blockchain used for IoT applications
    should have to be adapted to the amount of traffic that such applications usually
    generate. This is a concern for traditional cloud-based architectures, which,
    as it is illustrated in Figure 5, evolved towards more complex edge and fog computing-based
    architectures. In such a Figure it can be observed that three architectures depend
    on a cloud, although, in practice, the dependency degree varies a great deal.
    In the case of a cloud-based architecture, the data collected by the Node Layer
    are forwarded directly to the cloud through IoT gateways without further processing
    that the one needed for protocol conversion (in case it is needed). There are
    also gateways that perform more sophisticated tasks (e.g., sensor fusion [79]),
    but in most cloud-centered applications, most processing is carried out in the
    cloud. FIGURE 5. Traditional IoT architecture evolution. Show All However, note
    that traditional cloud-centered IoT architectures have certain inherent vulnerabilities
    [59], being the most relevant the fact that the cloud is a point of failure: if
    the cloud is down due to cyberattacks, maintenance or software problems, the whole
    system stops working. In addition, it is important to emphasize that if a single
    IoT device is compromised, it may disrupt the whole network by performing Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks [80], eavesdropping private data [81], altering the collected
    data [82] or misleading other systems [83]. Therefore, once an IoT device connected
    to the cloud or to a central server is breached, the rest of the nodes may be
    compromised. In contrast, blockchain-based systems do not rely on a unique central
    server or cloud. Moreover, transactions are verified cryptographically, so when
    malicious activities from a compromised device are detected, the system can reject
    its blockchain updates. The other two architectures depicted in Figure 5 are more
    recent and offload part of the processing from the cloud to the edge of the network.
    This offloading is key for IoT applications, since it is estimated that if the
    number of IoT connected devices keeps on growing at the same rate [1], the amount
    of communications to be handled by a cloud will increase remarkably and, therefore,
    the cloud network capacity will have to be expanded. Thus, Edge and fog computing
    can be used to support physically distributed, low-latency and QoS-aware applications
    that decrease the network traffic and the computational load of traditional cloud
    computing systems. Fog computing is based on a set of local gateways able to respond
    fast to IoT node requests through specific services. Such nodes can also interact
    with each other and, when required, with the cloud (for instance, for long term
    storage). In Figure 5, fog local gateways are represented by Single-Board Computers
    (SBCs), which are low-cost and low-energy consumption computers that can be installed
    easily in a reduced space. Examples of popular SBCs are the different versions
    of Raspberry Pi [84] or BeagleBone [85]. Fog computing is actually considered
    a subset of edge computing [72], which has recently been presented as a valid
    architecture for supporting blockchain and blockchainless DAG IoT applications
    [86]. As it can be observed in Figure 5, in the Edge Computing Layer, besides
    fog gateways there is a cloudlet, which in practice consists in one or more high-end
    computers that act like a reduced version of a cloud. The main advantage of cloudlets
    is that they can provide high-speed responses to compute-intensive tasks required
    by the Node Layer (e.g., running a full node of a blockchain), which cannot be
    delivered effectively when using resource-constrained fog gateways. There are
    other architectures that have been explored in the past in order to tackle the
    architectural issues that arise when providing BIoT services. A brief but good
    compilation of alternatives can be found in [87]. In such a paper the advantages
    and disadvantages of four different architectures (that the authors call Fully
    Centralized, Pseudo-Distributed Things, Distributed Things and Fully Distributed)
    are discussed. The researchers conclude that a BIoT architecture should be as
    close as possible to the Fully Distributed approach, but that, in some scenarios
    where computational power or cost are limiting factors, other approaches may be
    more appropriate. An interesting platform that promotes decentralization for IoT
    systems is IBM’s ADEPT. Such a platform was conceived for secure, scalable and
    autonomous peer-to-peer IoT telemetry. According to the authors, ADEPT is presented
    more as a starting point for discussion than as an implementation, but its white
    paper [88] provides a detailed description on the requirements for the platform.
    For instance, the researchers point out that an IoT device should be able to authenticate
    autonomously and to self-maintain, leaving to the manufacturers the responsibility
    of registering new devices in the blockchain. In addition, ADEPT’s vision of mining
    is different from the one implemented in Bitcoin. Mining is necessary in Bitcoin
    to restrict currency issuance, but IBM considers that such a limitation restricts
    scalability and imposes an increasing computational cost. Therefore, ADEPT uses
    Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and PoW, which guarantee network integrity and security,
    but which do not impose additional limitations. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning
    that IBM’s architecture for ADEPT distinguishes among three types of IoT devices
    (Light Peers, Standard Peers and Peer Exchanges), which differ in their role and
    computational capabilities. Finally, the authors of the white paper indicate the
    software selected for implementing ADEPT (Telehash [89], BitTorrent [90] and Ethereum)
    and describe different practical use cases of the system, like a washer that buys
    detergent automatically when it is low. Another BIoT architecture is proposed
    in [91] and [92]. In such papers the authors devise a theoretical lightweight
    architecture with security and privacy in mind, which reduces the communications
    overhead introduced by the use of a blockchain. The presented system is oriented
    towards home automation and its architecture is divided into three layers: the
    smart home layer, where there are sensors, actuators and local storage; an overlay
    network of peers and shared storage; and a cloud, which also provides remote storage.
    In the lower layers (smart homes and overlay network) storage is composed by traditional
    storage servers and blockchains, either public or private. The reduction in overhead
    is carried out by removing the PoW consensus mechanism, so every block is mined
    and appended to the blockchain without additional efforts. Every transaction is
    also appended to a block and is assumed that it is a true transaction, being the
    owner the one responsible for adding/removing devices. This simplification eases
    the blockchain functioning and, although the researchers studied the impact of
    different attacks on the system, it is not clear that the proposed scheme would
    withstand attacks performed by compromised IoT nodes whose contribution (e.g.,
    collected sensor values), which is assumed to be true by default, may alter the
    behavior of other subsystems. IoT is also gaining traction thanks to its global
    vision where devices are interconnected seamlessly among them and with the environment.
    For such a purpose, in [93] it is presented a theoretical blockchain-based architecture
    focused both on providing IoT services and connecting heterogeneous devices. The
    proposed architecture makes use of hierarchical and multi-layered blockchains,
    which enable building a contextual service discovery system called CONNECT. A
    multi-layer IoT architecture based on blockchain technology is described in [94].
    The proposed architecture decreases the complexity of deploying a blockchain by
    dividing the IoT ecosystem in levels and making use of the blockchain in each
    one. The researchers state that the architecture harnesses both the power of a
    cloud and the security and reliability of the blockchain. A slightly different
    approach is presented in [95], where it is evaluated the use of a cloud and a
    fog computing architecture to provide BIoT applications. The authors indicate
    that the architecture is proposed because is really difficult to host a regular
    blockchain on traditional resource-constrained IoT devices. Thus, the researchers
    measure empirically the performance of the system proposed by using IoT nodes
    based on Intel Edison boards and IBM’s Bluemix as blockchain technology. The obtained
    results show that, under high transaction loads, the fog system latency response
    is clearly faster than in a cloud-based system. Following similar ideas, the same
    authors presented another two works. In [96] they describe the implementation
    of RESTful microservices on the architecture, while in [97] they extend the architecture
    to a paradigm they call the Internet of Smart Things. Another architecture based
    on edge computing is presented in [98], which describes ongoing research on the
    development of a hierarchical and distributed platform based on the IEC 61499
    standard [99], which supports distributed automation control systems. Such systems
    can be structured in two layers: a bottom layer that controls devices and processes,
    and a top layer that supervises the bottom layer. For the top layer, the platform
    uses a blockchain based on Hyperledger Fabric [35] that implements smart contracts
    to perform supervision tasks. The edge nodes conform the bottom layer and are
    based on a micro-service architecture that makes use of Docker containers [100]
    and Kubernetes [101]. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been also suggested
    for implementing BIoT architectures. For instance, in [102] it is proposed a novel
    blockchain-based architecture that makes use of SDN to control the fog nodes of
    an IoT network. The system makes use of a cloud to perform compute-intensive tasks,
    while providing low-latency data access through fog computing. The fog nodes are
    the ones that are distributed, providing services and interaction with the blockchain.
    The results obtained by the authors indicate that the architecture reduces delays,
    increases throughput and it is able to detect real-time attacks on the IoT network.
    In the specific case of a flooding attack, the architecture is able to balance
    the load between the fog nodes thanks to the use of the blockchain and an SDN
    algorithm. In addition, the same authors describe in [103] a similar SDN-based
    approach. B. Cryptographic Algorithms Public-key cryptography is essential for
    providing security and privacy in a blockchain. However, resource-constraint IoT
    devices struggle with the computing requirements of modern secure cryptographic
    schemes [104]. Specifically, asymmetric cryptography based on Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
    (RSA) is slow and power consuming when implemented on IoT devices [41]. Therefore,
    when choosing the right cryptographic scheme, it should be taken into account
    not only the computational load and the memory requirements, but also the energy
    consumed. The most common public-key based cipher suites are RSA and Elliptic
    Curve Diffie-Hellman Exchange (ECDHE), which are the ones recommended by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [105] for Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) [106]. RSA-based cipher suites use RSA [107] as the key exchange algorithm,
    while the ECDHE-based ones use an algorithm that makes use of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
    based on Elliptic Curves [108]. Current RSA key sizes are not practical for most
    IoT devices. A 2048-bit key is the minimum size considered secure, since 768-bit
    and 1024-bit RSA implementations were broken in 2010 [109], [110]. Although possible,
    the use of a 2048-bit certificates on an ephemeral key exchange algorithm introduces
    heavy overhead and computing requirements, which are very difficult to accommodate
    on the constrained hardware capabilities of most IoT nodes. In contrast, Elliptic
    Curve Cryptography (ECC) represents a much lighter alternative to RSA [111], [112].
    It has already been shown that, when implemented on resource-constrained devices,
    ECC outperforms RSA in terms of speed [113]–[115] and power consumption [116]–[119].
    However, note that in August 2015 the National Security Agency (NSA) recommended
    stopping the use of Suite B, an ECC-based algorithm, apparently, because of the
    progress recently made on quantum cryptography [120]. Regarding hash functions,
    they are also key in a blockchain-based system, since they are required to sign
    transactions. Therefore, hash functions for IoT applications have to be secure
    (i.e., they should not generate collisions [121]), fast and should consume the
    smallest possible amount of energy. The most popular blockchain hash functions
    are SHA-256d (used by Bitcoin, PeerCoin or Namecoin), SHA-256 (used by Swiftcoin
    or Emercoin) and Scrypt (used by Litecoin, Gridcoin or Dogecoin). The performance
    of SHA-256 has been evaluated in different IoT devices, like wearables [122].
    However, researchers that evaluated the footprint and energy requirements of SHA-256
    in ASICs, concluded that, for low-power secure communications, it is more efficient
    to make use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [123]. Due to such power limitations,
    other researchers suggested using ciphers like Simon [124], but further research
    and empirical evaluations on real BIoT applications are still needed. C. Message
    Timestamping In order to track modifications on the blockchain, transactions have
    to be both signed and timestamped. This last task should be performed in a synchronized
    way, so timestamping servers are commonly used. Different timestamping mechanisms
    can be used. Traditional schemes rely on having trustworthiness on the server,
    which signs and timestamps transactions with its own private key. Nonetheless,
    no one deters the server from signing past transactions. For such a reason, diverse
    authors have proposed secure mechanisms. For instance, the method implemented
    by Bitcoin is inspired by one of the solutions proposed in [125], where each timestamp
    includes a hash of the previous timestamp, what maintains the order of the transactions
    (even when the clocks are inaccurate) and makes it difficult to insert fake transactions
    in the already linked chain. In addition, timestamping can be distributed, hence
    avoiding the problem of having a single point of failure. Although such a distributed
    system is prone to Sybil attacks [126], Bitcoin solves them by linking blocks
    and using the PoW mechanism. Other authors recently proposed the use of a decentralized
    timestamping service [127] or the distribution of its keys [128], but the topic
    has still to be studied in detail when decentralizing the service among devices
    of an IoT network. D. Consensus Mechanisms, Mining and Message Validation Consensus
    is key for the proper functioning of a blockchain. It basically consists in a
    mechanism that determines the conditions to be reached in order to conclude that
    an agreement has been reached regarding the validations of the blocks to be added
    to the blockchain [26]. In practice, the problem is the Byzantine Generals Problem
    previously described in the Introduction. The most egalitarian (and idealistic)
    consensus mechanism consists in giving to all the miners the same weight when
    voting and then deciding according to the majority of the votes. This scheme may
    be possible to implement in a controlled environment, but, in a public blockchain,
    this mechanism would lead to Sybil attacks, since a unique user with multiple
    identities would be able to control the blockchain [126]. In practice, in a decentralized
    architecture, one user has to be selected to add every block. This selection could
    be performed randomly, but the problem is that random selection is prone to attacks.
    PoW consensus algorithms are based on the fact that if a node performs a lot of
    work for the network, it is less likely that it is going to attack it. Specifically,
    the solution proposed by PoW-based blockchains makes it difficult to perform Sybil
    attacks by requiring miners to perform computationally expensive tasks that, theoretically,
    cannot be carried out by a single entity. The work performed usually involves
    doing some calculations until a solution is found, a process that is commonly
    known as mining. In the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, mining consists in finding
    a random number (called nonce) that will make the SHA-256 hash of the block header
    to have at the beginning certain number of zeroes. Therefore, miners have to demonstrate
    that they have performed certain amount of work to solve the problem. Once the
    problem is solved, it is really easy for other nodes to verify that the obtained
    answer is correct. However, this mining process makes the blockchain inefficient
    in throughput, scalability [78], and in terms of energy consumption, what is not
    desirable in an IoT network. Due to the problems previously mentioned, several
    alternative consensus methods have been proposed. The following are the most relevant:
    PoS is a consensus mechanism that requires less computational power than PoW,
    so it consumes less energy. In a PoS-based blockchain it is assumed that the entities
    with more participation on the network are the ones less interested in attacking
    it. Thus, miners have to prove periodically that they own certain amount of participation
    on the network (e.g., currency). Since this scheme seems unfair, because the wealthiest
    participants are the ones ruling the blockchain, other variants have been proposed.
    For example, Peercoin’s consensus algorithm [129] takes coin age into account:
    the entities with the oldest and largest sets of coins would be more likely to
    mine a block. Because of the advantages of PoS, some blockchains like Ethereum
    are planning to move from PoW to PoS. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) [130] is
    similar to PoS, but stakeholders instead of being the ones generating and validating
    blocks, they select certain delegates to do it. Since less nodes are involved
    in block validation, transactions are performed faster than with other schemes.
    In addition, delegates can adjust block size and intervals, and, if they behave
    dishonestly, they can be substituted easily. Transactions as Proof-of-Stake (TaPoS)
    [131] is a PoS variant. While in PoS systems only some nodes contribute to the
    consensus, in TaPoS all nodes that generate transactions contribute to the security
    of the network. Proof-of-Activity (PoA) consensus algorithms were proposed due
    to the main limitation of PoS systems based on stake age: it is accumulated even
    when the node is not connected to the network. Thus, PoA schemes have been proposed
    to encourage both ownership and activity on the blockchain [132], rewarding stakeholders
    who participate instead of punishing passive stakeholders. A similar approach
    is proposed by Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV) [133]. It is implemented by Reddcoin
    [134], which is based on the concept of velocity of money. Such a concept indicates
    how many times a unit of currency flows through an economy and is used by the
    members of a society during a certain time period. Usually, the higher the velocity
    of money, the more transactions in which it is used and the healthier the economy.
    PBFT [135] is a consensus algorithm that solves the Byzantine Generals Problem
    for asynchronous environments. PBFT assumes that less than a third of the nodes
    are malicious. For every block to be added to the chain, a leader is selected
    to be in charge of ordering the transaction. Such a selection has to be supported
    by at least 2/3 of the all nodes, which have to be known by the network. Delegated
    BFT (DBFT) is a variant of BFT where, in a similar way to DPOS, some specific
    nodes are voted to be the ones generating and validating blocks. The Ripple consensus
    algorithm [136] was proposed to reduce the high latencies found in many blockchains,
    which are in part due to the use of synchronous communications among the nodes.
    Thus, each Ripple’s server (i.e., miner) relies on a trusted subset of nodes when
    determining consensus, what clearly reduces latency. Stellar Consensus Protocol
    (SCP) is a implementation of a consensus method called Federated Byzantine Agreement
    (FBA) [137]. It is similar to PBFT but, whilst in PBFT every node queries all
    the other nodes and waits for the majority to agree, in SCP the nodes only wait
    for a subset of the participants that they consider important. BFTRaft [138] is
    a BFT consensus scheme based on the Raft algorithm [139], which is aimed at being
    simple and easy to understand for students. Such an aim makes Raft assume simplifications
    that rarely hold in practice, like the fact that nodes only fail by stopping.
    Thus, BFTRaft enhances the Raft algorithm by making it Byzantine fault tolerant
    and by increasing its security against diverse threats. Sieve [140] is a consensus
    algorithm proposed by IBM Research that has already been implemented for Hyperledger-Fabric.
    Its objective is to run non-deterministic smart contracts on a permissioned blockchain
    that makes use of BFT replication. In such a scenario, Sieve replicates the processes
    related to non-deterministic smart contracts and then compares the results. If
    a divergence is detected among the results obtained by a small number of processes,
    they are sieved out. However, if the number of divergent processes is excessive,
    the whole operation is sieved out. Tendermint [141] is a consensus algorithm that
    can host arbitrary application states and can only tolerate up to a 1/3 of failures.
    In Tendermint, blockchain participants are called validators and they propose
    blocks of transactions and vote on them. A block is validated in two stages (pre-vote
    and pre-commit) and it can only be committed when more than 2/3 of the validators
    pre-commit it in a round. Bitcoin-NG [142] implements a variant of the Bitcoin
    consensus algorithm aimed at improving scalability, throughput and latency. The
    developers performed experiments with 1,000 nodes and concluded that Bitcoin-NG
    scales optimally, only limited by the bandwidth of the nodes and the latency related
    to the propagation time of the network. Proof-of-Burn (PoB) is a consensus method
    that requires miners to show proof of their commitment to mining by burning some
    cryptocurrency through an unspendable address. The idea behind PoB is that, instead
    of burning resources (e.g., energy in the case of many PoW implementations), cryptocurrency
    is burnt as it is considered as expensive as such resources. Proof-of-Personhood
    (PoP) [143] is a consensus mechanism that makes use of ring signatures [144] and
    collective signing [145] to bind physical to virtual identities in a way that
    anonymity is preserved. A very similar concept is Proof-of-Individuality (PoI),
    which is currently being developed on Ethereum by the PoI Project [146]. Finally,
    it is worth noting that private blockchains, which control user access, reduce
    the probability of Sybil attacks, so they do not require costly mining algorithms
    and economic incentives are removed. E. Blockchain Updating/Maintenance and Protocol
    Stack The construction of an IoT network requires deploying a huge number of devices.
    Such devices embed certain firmware that is usually updated to correct bugs, prevent
    attacks [147] or just to improve some functionality. Traditionally, IoT devices
    had to be updated manually or with Over-The-Air (OTA) updates [148]. According
    to some researchers [149] these updates can be performed by using a blockchain,
    which enables IoT devices to spread securely new firmware versions. Regarding
    the protocol stack, some authors suggested changes on the traditional OSI stack
    to adapt it to blockchain technologies. The most relevant is the so-called “Internet
    of Money” (IoM) [150], which proposes a set of five layers that operate on TCP/IP
    (shown in Figure 6). Such five layers include: A Ledger Layer that creates ledgers
    and issues assets. A Payment and Exchange Layer. A Pathfinding Layer that calculates
    the optimal set of atomic operations to be executed for the desired value transfer
    or exchange. A Contract Layer that controls balances through certain running code.
    An Application Layer that allows for developing applications and user interfaces.
    FIGURE 6. IoM versus traditional OSI protocol stack. Show All More research is
    still needed in order to study the need for specific stacks and to analyze their
    performance in comparison to other traditional OSI-based stacks. SECTION V. Current
    Challenges for BIoT Applications Today, emerging technologies in the IoT ecosystem
    like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) [151]–[153], RFID [154], telemetry systems [155]
    or 4G/5G broadband communications [156], [157] have to face several challenges.
    Specifically, the case of mission-critical scenarios [158] rise additional concerns.
    Adding blockchain to the mix implies further operational and technical requirements
    since the development of BIoT applications is a complex process that is affected
    by many aspects that are interrelated. The main factors are described in the next
    subsections and are depicted in Figure 7. FIGURE 7. Most relevant factors that
    condition the development of a BIoT application and their main relationships.
    Show All A. Privacy All the users of a blockchain are identified by their public
    key or its hash. This means that anonymity is not guaranteed and, since all transactions
    are shared, it is possible for third-parties to analyze such transactions and
    infer the actual identities of the participants [159], [160]. Privacy is even
    more complex in IoT environments, since IoT devices can reveal private user data
    that could be stored in a blockchain whose privacy requirements differ from one
    country to another [161]. Therefore, in contrast to traditional online payments,
    which are usually only visible to transacting parties and to a middleman (e.g.,
    financial institutions, government), the transparent transactions fostered by
    blockchain are a challenge in terms of privacy. Identity certification may also
    be a problem in IoT: if an identity provider is responsible for authorizing entities,
    it can also be able to block them. To address such a challenge, in [162] it is
    proposed the use of a permissioned blockchain for securing and managing multiple
    IoT nodes. The proposed system provides a distributed identity management solution
    that increases security and protection against attacks by rotating asymmetric
    keys. Such keys are generated locally on the device and they are never moved from
    it. To verify the identity of a user while rotating keys, the system makes use
    of a mechanism called Device Group Membership (DGM) that includes in a group all
    the devices that belong to a user and, when a user carries out a transaction,
    it is reflected on the blockchain as it was performed by a device that belonged
    to the user’s group. The proposed solution also enhances security by using a certificate
    system for authentication and by enabling the hash function substitution if it
    is compromised. It is also worth mentioning that the system can be tweaked to
    limit the amount of temporal data stored, which is useful for IoT devices with
    little storage space (for instance, it could only be stored the data from the
    previous 24 hours). Another approach focused on solving the privacy and robustness
    problems derived from using centralized identity management systems is described
    in [92]. There the authors emphasize the need for providing automatic authentication
    systems for IoT applications where scalability is needed and where device heterogeneity
    and mobility are common. To deal with such challenges, the researchers present
    a blockchain-based system for IoT smart homes that extracts appliance signatures
    automatically in order to identify both the appliances and their users. Access
    management to IoT networks is challenging as well. Some researchers [163] suggested
    improving it by defining a blockchain-based multi-level mechanism, which would
    specify capabilities, access lists and access rights. However, note that, in many
    IoT applications anonymity is not necessary, but the privacy of the transactions
    is required in certain scenarios when the collected data may allow for monitoring
    and predicting people behavior or habits. This has already been an issue in fields
    like RFID-based transportation card systems, where the stored information (i.e.,
    trips, balance, personal data) is supposedly anonymous, but in practice it may
    be collected by third parties [164]–[166]. The issue is even more problematic
    when adding a blockchain, since transactions are shared among peers, what in certain
    fields like industry or financial systems, allows for monitoring the activity
    of competitors. Therefore, solutions have to be proposed to mitigate these privacy
    issues. For example, in the case of public blockchains a user does not need to
    know the address of every user, just the one of the counterparty he/she is dealing
    with. If a blockchain participant makes use of a new address for every transaction,
    data analysis would become more difficult. This is similar to what smartphones
    manufacturers have implemented to avoid Wi-Fi tracking [167], [168]. A more practical
    but less anonymous solution would consist in using a unique address for each counterparty.
    In a private blockchain, since access controls are performed, there is at least
    one node that knows who accesses the system. Assuming the neutrality of the access
    controller, it is possible to reduce exposure by establishing an independent blockchain
    with every entity a user is collaborating with. This setup increases communications
    complexity, but isolates the user from non-desired monitoring. For instance, Multichain
    [169] provides a solution for deploying private blockchains (it can work with
    different blockchains at the same time) that ensures that the activities on the
    blockchain can be monitored by chosen participants. Mixing techniques can also
    help to enhance privacy. Such techniques can collect transactions from diverse
    IoT devices and output events or other transactions to different addresses that
    are not linked to the original devices. These techniques increase privacy, but
    they are not perfect, since they may be de-anonymized through statistical disclosure
    attacks [170]. Moreover, the mixing service has to be trusted, since a malicious
    mixer may expose users and, in the case of economic transactions, it may end up
    stealing coins. To tackle these issues different proposals suggested exposing
    theft through an accountability mechanism [171] or hiding the input/output address
    mapping from the mixing server [172]. Privacy can also be increased through zero-knowledge
    proving techniques like the ones used by Zerocoin [173], Zerocash [174] or Zcash
    [175]. A zero-knowledge proof is a method that allows for proving to a counterparty
    that a user knows certain information without revealing such an information [176].
    In the case of IoT applications, zero-knowledge proofs can be used for authentication
    or during regular transactions in order to avoid revealing the identity of a user
    or a device. However, note that these proofs are not immune to attacks [177].
    In fact, like in the case of mixing techniques, they are susceptible to de-anonymization
    through statistical disclosure attacks, but they improve mixing techniques by
    avoiding the necessity for a mixing server, which can pose a security or performance
    bottleneck. It must be also remarked the privacy-focused efforts performed by
    several initiatives like Bytecoin [178] or Monero [179], which are based in CryptoNote
    [180]. CryptoNote is a protocol that makes use of ring signatures and whose transactions
    cannot be followed through the blockchain in order to determine who performed
    them. The only people that can access the transaction information are the parties
    that carry it out or whoever knows one of the two private keys. One of the keys
    of CryptoNote is its implementation of the concept of ring signature [144], which
    makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing who of
    them actually produced the signature. Another possible solution for preserving
    privacy is the use of homomorphic encryption [181], [182]. Such a kind of encryption
    allows third-party IoT services to process a transaction without revealing the
    unencrypted data to those services. Several researchers have suggested variations
    on the Bitcoin protocol to make use of homomorphic commitments [183], [184]. Finally,
    note that part of the mechanisms previously mentioned require a relevant number
    of computational resources, so its applicability to resource-constrained IoT devices
    is currently limited. B. Security Traditionally, three requirements have to be
    fulfilled by an information system in order to guarantee its security: Confidentiality.
    The most sensitive information should be protected from unauthorized accesses.
    Integrity. It guarantees that data are not altered or deleted by unauthorized
    parties. It is also usually added that, if an authorized party damages the information,
    it should be possible to undo the changes. Availability. Data can be accessed
    when needed. Regarding confidentiality, the part related to the transaction data
    is associated with their privacy, which has been already analyzed in the previous
    subsection. With respect to the infrastructure that supports the stored data,
    it can be stated that current IoT applications tend to centralize communications
    in a server, in a farm of servers or in a cloud. Such an approach is valid as
    long as the administrators of the centralized infrastructure are trusted and while
    the system remains robust against attacks [185], [186] and internal leaks. In
    contrast, blockchain technologies are characterized by being decentralized, so,
    although one node is compromised, the global system should keep on working. For
    an individual user, the key for maintaining confidentiality is a good management
    of his/her private keys, since it is what an attacker needs in conjunction with
    the public key to impersonate someone or steal something from him/her. An interesting
    initiative related to this topic is CONIKS [187], a key management system created
    to liberate users from encryption key management. In such a system the user first
    has to ask for a public key to a provider, which only requires a user name to
    register in the CONIKS system. When a user wants to send a message to another
    user, his/her CONIKS client looks for the counterparty’s key in the key directory.
    In order to avoid key tampering from the service provider (which might become
    compromised), before sending any message, two verifications are performed: it
    is checked that the public key of the receiver is the one used by other clients
    when communicating with the same user, and that such a key has not changed unexpectedly
    over time. Similar solutions have been proposed for IoT devices, making use of
    blockchain technology to strengthen their identity and access management, since
    blockchains provide a defense against IP spoofing and forgery attacks [59]. Certificates
    are also essential when guaranteeing security on the Internet. Therefore, certificate
    authorities that make use of a public-key infrastructure have to provide trust
    to third-parties. However, such authorities have proven to fail in certain occasions
    [188], then having to invalidate certificates previously issued. Some recent initiatives
    are aimed at fixing certain structural flaws found in the SSL certificate system.
    Specifically, Google’s Certificate Transparency [189] provides a framework for
    monitoring and auditing SSL certificates in almost real time. The solution uses
    a distributed system based on Merkle hash trees that allows third-parties to audit
    and verify whether a certificate is valid. With respect to integrity, it must
    be indicated that the foundations of a blockchain are designed to store information
    that cannot be altered (or that it is very costly to do it) once it is stored.
    Nonetheless, note that in the past there were certain situations when this principle
    was ignored. For instance, in 2014, in an event that it is still to be clarified,
    the currency exchange platform MintPal notified its users that a hacker had stolen
    almost 8 million Vericoins, what was about 30% of the total coins of such a platform.
    To prevent the loss of investor funds and the fact that an actor would control
    30% of the coin’s proof-of-stake network capacity, the Vericoin developers decided
    to hard fork the blockchain, reversing the damage (a hard fork is a permanent
    divergence from the previous version of the blockchain). Therefore, although many
    information sources indicate that blockchains are a permanent storage for data
    that cannot be altered, it is actually not true in practice for preserving integrity
    in very exceptional cases. In IoT applications, data integrity is also essential
    and it is usually provided by third-parties. To avoid such a dependence, in [190]
    it is proposed a data integrity service framework for cloud-based IoT applications
    that makes use of blockchain technology, thus eliminating the need for trusting
    such third-parties. The third characteristic of security is availability, but
    it is actually the most straightforward to be fulfilled by blockchains, since
    they are conceived by design to be distributed systems, what allows them to keep
    on working even when some nodes are under attack. Nevertheless, availability can
    be compromised through other types of attacks. The most feared attack is a 51-percent
    attack (also called majority attack), where a single miner can control the whole
    blockchain and perform transactions at wish. In this situation, data are available,
    but the availability for performing transactions can be blocked by the attacker
    that controls the blockchain. Obviously, this kind of attack also affects data
    integrity. C. Energy Efficiency IoT end-nodes usually make use of resource-constrained
    hardware that is powered by batteries. Therefore, energy efficiency is key to
    enable a long-lasting node deployment. However, many blockchains are characterized
    by being power-hungry. In such cases most of the consumption is due to two factors:
    Mining. Blockchains like Bitcoin make use of massive amounts of electricity due
    to the mining process, which involves a consensus algorithm (PoW) that consists
    in a sort of brute force search for a hash. P2P communications. P2P communications
    require edge devices that have to be powered on continuously, which could lead
    to waste energy [191], [192]. Some researchers proposed energy efficient protocols
    for P2P networks [193]–[195], but the issue still has to be studied further for
    the specific case of IoT networks. Regarding mining, some authors suggested that
    the power consumed by proofs of work could be used for something useful while
    providing at the same time the required PoW [196]. Obtaining such proofs should
    have certain degree of difficulty, while its verification should be really fast.
    Some initiatives based on blockchains, like Gridcoin [197], reward volunteer scientific
    research computing with coins (although, as a consensus algorithm, Gridcoin uses
    PoS). Another interesting example is Primecoin [198], whose PoW mechanism looks
    for chains of prime numbers. Thus, a massive infrastructure like the one involved
    in IoT could also be harnessed to solve problems while making use of a blockchain.
    Proof-of-Space (PoS) (also known as Proof-of-Capacity (PoC)) has also been suggested
    as a greener alternative to PoW [199]. PoS systems require users to show a legitimate
    interest in a specific service by allocating certain amount of memory or disk.
    This mechanism has already been implemented by cryptocurrencies like Burst-coin
    [200]. Other consensus methods have been proposed to reduce energy consumption
    respect to PoW, like Proof-of-Stake or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (both
    described in Section IV-D). In relation to P2P communications, they are essential
    for a blockchain to communicate peers and distribute blocks, so the more updates
    a blockchain receives, the more energy consumption is dedicated to communications.
    To reduce the number of updates, mini-blokchains [201] may allow IoT nodes to
    interact directly with a blockchain, since they only keep the latest transactions
    and lower the computational requirements of a full node. In terms of hashing algorithms,
    SHA-256 is the reference due to being the one used by Bitcoin, but new algorithms
    like Scrypt [202] or X11 [203] are faster and thus can reduce mining energy consumption.
    Other hashing algorithms have been suggested, like Blake-256 [204], and some blockchains
    are able to make use of different hashing algorithms (e.g., Myriad [205]), but
    further analyses should be carried out on the performance and optimization of
    modern hash functions to be used on IoT devices. D. Throughput and Latency IoT
    deployments may require a blockchain network able to manage large amounts of transactions
    per time unit. This is a limitation in certain networks. For instance, Bitcoin’s
    blockchain has a theoretical maximum of 7 transactions per second [78], although
    it can be increased by processing larger blocks or by modifying certain aspects
    of the node behavior when accepting transactions [206]. In comparison, other networks
    are remarkably faster. For instance, VISA network (VisaNet) can handle up to 24,000
    transactions per second [207]. Regarding latency, it is important to note that
    blockchain transactions take some time to be processed. For example, in the case
    of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution with a 10-minute
    mean [18], although, for avoiding double-spend, merchants are recommended to wait
    for about an hour, since five or six blocks usually need to be added to the chain
    before the transaction is confirmed. This latency requires only a few seconds
    in the case of VISA [207]. In relation to the consensus latency, it can be stated
    that the complexity of the consensus process is more important in terms of latency
    than individual hashing, but different blockchains, like the one that supports
    Litecoin [34], have opted for using scrypt, a hashing algorithm that is slightly
    faster than SHA-256. E. Blockchain Size, Bandwidth and Infrastructure Blockchains
    grow periodically as users store their transactions, what derives into larger
    initial download times and in having to make use of more powerful miners with
    larger persistent memories. Blockchain compression techniques should be further
    studied, but the truth is that most IoT nodes would not be able to handle even
    a small fraction of a traditional blockchain. Moreover, note that many nodes have
    to store large amounts of data that are of no interest for them, what can be regarded
    as a waste of computational resources. This issue could be avoided by using lightweight
    nodes, which are able to perform transactions on the blockchain, but who do not
    have to store it. However, this approach requires the existence in the IoT hierarchy
    of certain powerful nodes that would maintain the blockchain for the resource-constrained
    nodes, what implies a certain degree of data centralization. Another alternative
    would consist in the use of a mini-blockchain [183], [201]. Such a kind of blockchain
    introduces the use of an account tree, which stores the current state of every
    user of the blockchain. Thus, only the most recent transaction has to be stored
    on the blockchain together with the account tree. Therefore, the blockchain only
    grows when new users are added to the blockchain. In addition, note that transaction
    and block size have to be scaled according to the bandwidth limitations of IoT
    networks: many small transactions would increase the energy consumption associated
    with communications, while a few large ones may involve big payloads that cannot
    be handled by some IoT devices. Regarding the infrastructure, certain elements
    are required to make the blockchain work properly, including decentralized storage,
    communication protocols, mining hardware, address management or network administration.
    Part of these needs are being fulfilled by the industry progressively, creating
    specific equipment for blockchain applications. For instance, miners have evolved
    from simple CPU-based systems, to more sophisticated equipment that harnesses
    the power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
    (FPGAs) or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) [208]. F. Other Relevant
    Issues 1) Adoption Rate One of the factors that may prevent a wide adoption of
    a BIoT application is the fact that a blockchain enables pseudo-anonymity (i.e.,
    users or devices are identified by addresses, but they are not clearly linked
    to them). Governments may demand a strong link between real-world and online identity.
    Moreover, since IoT transactions can be carried out internationally, it may not
    be clear who should perform the identification. In addition, note that the value
    and security of a blockchain increases with the number of users, also being more
    difficult to perform the feared 51-percent attacks. Moreover, note that miner
    adoption rate also influences the capacity of a network to process transactions,
    so, in a BIoT deployment, the computational power brought by miners should be
    high enough to handle the transactions received from the IoT devices. 2) Usability
    In order to ease the work of developers, blockchain access Application Programming
    Interface (APIs) should be as user-friendly as possible. The same should be applied
    to the APIs to manage user accounts. 3) Multi-Chain Management In some cases,
    the proliferation of blockchains has derived into the necessity of having to deal
    with several of them at the same time. This can also happen in an IoT scenario,
    where, for instance, sensor values may be stored in a private blockchain, while
    financial transactions among nodes that provide services may be supported by Ethereum’s
    or Bitcoin’s blockchain. 4) Versioning and Forks Blockchains can be forked for
    administrative or versioning purposes. Once a blockchain is forked, it is not
    easy to carry out transactions between both chains. 5) Mining Boycott Miners end
    up deciding which transactions are or are not stored in the blockchain, so they
    are able to censor certain transactions for economic or ideological reasons. This
    issue can happen when the number of conspiring miners are above 51 percent of
    the total, so small chains and blockchains that delegate their decisions on a
    subset of miners are susceptible to this kind of boycotts. Therefore, miners have
    to be chosen wisely and, when smart contracts have been signed, misbehaviors should
    be sanctioned. 6) Smart Contract Enforcement and Autonomy Legal rules have still
    to be developed to enforce smart contracts and resolve disputes properly. Some
    work is being performed for binding real-world contracts with smart contracts
    [161], but this is still an issue to be further studied. SECTION VI. Further Challenges
    and Recommendations Despite the promising benefits and the brilliant foreseen
    future of BIoT, there are significant challenges in the development and deployment
    of existing and planned systems that will need further investigation: Complex
    technical challenges: there are still issues to be addressed regarding the scalability,
    security, cryptographic development and stability requirements of novel BIoT applications.
    Moreover, blockchain technologies face design limitations in transaction capacity,
    in validation protocols or in the implementation of smart contracts. Furthermore,
    methods to solve the tendency to centralized approaches should be introduced.
    Interoperability and standardization: the adoption of BIoT will require the compromise
    of all stakeholders in order to achieve full interoperability (i.e., from data
    to policy interoperability) and integration with legacy systems. The adoption
    of collaborative implementations and the use of international standards for collaborative
    trust and information protection (i.e., access control, authentication and authorization)
    will be needed. For instance, authentication across multiple authorities or organizations
    requires Federated Identity Management (FIM) [209]. At an international scale,
    such a FIM currently exists only at a low Level of Assurance (LoA). The required
    LoA (from LoA 1 to LoA 4), as defined by the ISO/IEC 29115:2013 standard, is mainly
    based on risks, on the consequences of an authentication error and/or the misuse
    of credentials, on the resultant impact, and on their likelihood of occurrence.
    Thus, higher LoAs will be needed. Blockchain infrastructure: it will be needed
    to create a comprehensive trust framework or infrastructure that can fulfill all
    the requirements for the use of blockchain in IoT systems. Many state-of-the-art
    approaches that address issues such as trust depend on inter-domain policies and
    control. For instance, the governments should set up a blockchain infrastructure
    to support use cases of public interest. Organizational, governance, regulatory
    and legal aspects: besides technological challenges, shaping the regulatory environment
    (i.e., decentralized ownership, international jurisdiction) is one the biggest
    issues to unlock the potential value of BIoT. For instance, it is possible that
    some developers fake their blockchain performance in order to attract investors
    driven by the expected profits. Rapid field testing: in the near future, different
    types of blockchains for diverse applications will need to be optimized. Moreover,
    when users want to combine blockchain with IoT systems, the first step is to figure
    out which blockchain fits their requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to establish
    a mechanism to test different blockchains. This approach should be split into
    two main phases: standardization and testing. In the standardization phase, after
    a wide understanding of the supply chains, markets, products, and services, all
    the requirements have to be analyzed and agreed. When a blockchain is created,
    it should be tested with the agreed criteria to verify if the blockchain works
    as needed. In the case of the testing phase, different criteria should be evaluated
    in terms of privacy, security, energy efficiency, throughput, latency, blockchain
    capacity or usability, among others. SECTION VII. Conclusions The transition to
    a data-driven world is being accelerated by the pace of the technological advances
    of an Internet-enabled global world, the rise of societal challenges, and an increasing
    competition for scarce resources. In this ecosystem, blockchain can offer to IoT
    a platform for distributing trusted information that defy non-collaborative organizational
    structures. This review examined the state-of-the art of blockchain technologies
    and proposed significant scenarios for BIoT applications in fields like healthcare,
    logistics, smart cities or energy management. These BIoT scenarios face specific
    technical requirements that differ from implementations involving cryptocurrencies
    in several aspects like energy efficiency in resource-constrained devices or the
    need for a specific architecture. The aim of this work was to evaluate the practical
    limitations and identify areas for further research. Moreover, it presented a
    holistic approach to BIoT scenarios with a thorough study of the most relevant
    aspects involved in an optimized BIoT design, like its architecture, the required
    cryptographic algorithms or the consensus mechanisms. Furthermore, some recommendations
    were provided with the objective of giving some guidance to future BIoT researchers
    and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying
    the next generation of BIoT applications. We can conclude that, as in any technological
    innovation, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for a BIoT application. Nevertheless,
    the adoption of the paradigm opens a wide area of short- and medium-term potential
    applications that could disrupt the industry and probably, the economy, as we
    know it today. The global reality is a complex mix of different stakeholders in
    the IoT ecosystem, therefore it is necessary to reassess the different activities
    and actors involved in the near-future economy. We can conclude that BIoT is still
    in its nascent stage, and beyond the earliest BIoT developments and deployments,
    broader use will require additional technological research advances to address
    the specific demands, together with the collaboration of organizations and governments.

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,

    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction

    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages

    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    blockchain technology is attracting significant attentions in various agricultural
    applications. These applications could satisfy the diverse needs in the ecosystem
    of agricultural products, e.g., increasing transparency of food safety and IoT
    based food quality control, provenance traceability, improvement of contract exchanges,
    and transactions efficiency. As multiple untrusted parties, including small-scale
    farmers, food processors, logistic companies, distributors and retailers, are
    involved into the complex farm-to-fork pipeline, it becomes vital to achieve optimal
    trade-off between efficiency and integrity of the agricultural management systems
    as required in contexts. In this paper, we provide a survey to study both techniques
    and applications of blockchain technology used in the agricultural sector. First,
    the technical elements, including data structure, cryptographic methods, and consensus
    mechanisms are explained in detail. Secondly, the existing agricultural blockchain
    applications are categorized and reviewed to demonstrate the use of the blockchain
    techniques. In addition, the popular platforms and smart contract are provided
    to show how practitioners use them to develop these agricultural applications.
    Thirdly, we identify the key challenges in many prospective agricultural systems,
    and discuss the efforts and potential solutions to tackle these problems. Further,
    we conduct an improved food supply chain in the post COVID-19 pandemic economy
    as an illustration to demonstrate an effective use of blockchain technology. Agricultural
    stakeholders, including producers, logistic companies, manufacturers, retailers
    and financial institutions, can be involved to create blockchain applications...View

    I. Introduction Current agricultural development and reform are calling for new
    techniques and innovations to create a more transparent and accountable environment
    in the agriculture sector. One of the emerging tools is blockchain technology.
    Unlike conventional centralized and monopolistic agricultural management systems,
    blockchain provides a decentralized data structure to store and retrieve data
    that are shared with multiple untrusted parties. In this way, it could potentially
    resolve a number of serious problems in current systems caused by the following
    reasons: (i) hackers can easily attack the centralized system to tamper data integrity;
    (ii) insider manipulation of the centralized database could compromise data integrity;
    (iii) a supply chain management system is over-reliant on the centralized database
    (single point failure problem); and (iv) high costs when involving a third party
    to verify and monitor transactions. To solve these issues, distributed database
    enhanced by advanced cryptography is proposed in the past few decades. Among these,
    blockchain is one of the most predominant emerging methods to solve trust related
    issues generated by the invention of Bitcoin in 2008 [1]. In blockchain technology,
    many advanced computational and cryptographic techniques are integrated into distributed
    data structure to achieve a digital trust system in an untrusted environment [2].
    In particular, hash function, as an algorithmic way to generate unique IDs, is
    used as the key element for data authentication. Hash values can be embedded into
    a format of stored chain to verify whether the stored data are tampered to ensure
    data integrity. Digital signature is used to verify real identities of data senders
    and receivers in stored transactions. In addition, consensus mechanism is designed
    to involve all computer nodes thus minimizing potential risks of data being manipulated
    by minority attackers. Blockchain applications in agriculture enhance diverse
    aspects in agricultural systems, especially supply chain [3] and Internet of things
    (IoTs) based systems [4]. These applications include food safety [5], food security
    [6], food quality monitoring and control [7], traceability for waste reduction
    [8], reliable operational data analysis [9] and efficient contract exchanges and
    transactions to reduce economic costs [10], thus supporting small-scale farmers
    [11]. These applications can be developed by using existing blockchain platforms
    to facilitate easy and quick developments. Based on different deployment scenarios
    of these applications, different computational and cryptographic techniques can
    be plugged to provide flexibility to meet desperate user requirements. In this
    paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the blockchain based agricultural
    applications and current innovations to promote blockchain techniques. We first
    explain basic concepts of blockchain technology, illustrate the current data storage
    ecosystem and analyze existing popular platforms by which the developed applications
    are implemented. Then we provide a comprehensive survey on diverse blockchain
    applications in agriculture related projects. After the survey, we further discuss
    the prospective of the emerging technology and how current challenges could be
    solved in deployment of the systems. Further, an illustration is presented to
    demonstrate how blockchain can be improved to build a more reliable and efficient
    food supply chain in future. This research is based on existing literature. We
    have used a comprehensive literature search strategy. We first gather all relevant
    survey papers by complying with the systematic procedure via searching the relevant
    subjects in Google Scholar and many electronic databases, including Open Athens,
    IEEE Xplore and Science Direct. The search terms used to collect the relevant
    works are: blockchain for agricultural applications, blockchain for supply chain
    management, blockchain for IoT, data integrity, traceability, provenance, and
    IPFS with blockchain. All these terms are used in multiple search combinations
    to ensure the completion of data gathering. The comprehensive literature review
    is crucial for us to answer the following three main research questions: (1) What
    are the current standard blockchain applications in agriculture related projects?
    (2) What are the main challenges that these blockchain applications face in their
    deployments? And, how could these challenges be met? (3) How blockchain can be
    improved to build a more reliable and efficient food supply chain in the future?
    The contributions of our work can be highlighted as: (i) we make an insight investigation

    survey papers published in recent years [12]–[21], our work provides a comprehensive
    study in the agricultural context. In the work, both technical details and applicative
    aspects are covered so that our insights could be used to suggest suitable techniques
    and platforms for individual applications in their own agricultural scenarios.
    The structure of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, computational
    and cryptography algorithms used in blockchain technology are explained in details.
    In Section III, the latest blockchain applications are categorized and critically
    reviewed. Following the review, the challenges and prospective of combining blockchain
    with other emerging technologies are discussed in Section IV. Further, we present
    an illustration how blockchain can be deployed in a real-world scenario in Section
    V. Finally, the conclusion is drawn and future work is suggested in Section VI.
    SECTION II. Blockchain Techniques As a formal definition, blockchain is a distributed
    ledger to share transactions or sensitive data across untrusted multiple stockholders
    in a decentralized network [22]. A basic blockchain structure is illustrated in
    Fig. 1. The data are recorded in a sequential chain of hash-linked blocks that
    facilitate the data distribution in a more manageable manner comparing to other
    traditional data storage formats. The blocks are verified and uploaded into the
    chain-like system by selected nodes via an agreed consensus protocol. This consensus
    mechanism allows all the parties to engage in the monitoring process when adding
    data/information flow on-chain. In addition, the duplicates of these data are
    stored in all involving nodes to ensure their tamperlessness. In this section,
    a high-level review of blockchain ecosystem and technical details of the implementation
    are provided before the investigation of current blockchain applications in the
    agricultural sector. FIGURE 1. The data structure of a blockchain. Show All A.
    Data Storage Ecosystem Data storage and retrieval solutions are playing a centric
    role in agricultural systems. The ecosystem of data storage is illustrated in
    Fig. 2. Typical systems are still using conventional databases, such as MySQL,
    Oracle SQL and Postgres, to store and use data in a centralized way. They assume
    that data are synchronized well and shared among trusted parties. However, it
    is hard to hold the assumption in most real-world systems. Information asymmetric
    problem emphasized in [23] is a major issue to hinder the efficient allocation
    of resources in typical agricultural supply chains. As a variety of untrusted
    parties with different geographic locations are involved to generate data in a
    supply chain, it requires a more tamper-free system to protect the sharing of
    data across parties. The robust and decentralized features of blockchain offer
    one of the most suitable solutions by improving data transparency as well as data
    integrity without paying a third party to verify the process. FIGURE 2. The data
    storage ecosystem. Blockchain is playing an important role in the ecosystem. Show
    All Apart from the centralized solutions, blockchain systems dominate the distributed
    database solutions. Three types of blockchain systems are defined based on the
    accessibility and security level of applications: (1) public blockchain; (2) consortium
    blockchain; and (3) private blockchain. Public blockchain system can be joined
    by any nodes across the world with internet connection. The public blockchain
    is fully transparent so that data are difficult to be tampered by any internal
    or external attackers. However, the high decentralization trait of these systems
    generates large redundancy as well as less efficiency when considering the burden
    of sharing large amount of data. Therefore, the public blockchain is more suitable
    to applications with relatively small number of transactions (or data) to store
    into the blockchain system. Typical public blockchains include bitcoin [1] and
    Ethereum [24]. The private blockchain is deployed by a single party. It shares
    many similar characteristics to those centralized solutions but with a blockchain
    architecture. Although it is argued that private blockchain systems can be replaced
    by conventional solutions, it offers advantages over the centralized data storage
    when they are attacked by insiders. The consortium blockchain refers to a solution
    to keep data privacy and fast on-chain speed but involving more than one party
    for data storage. It is the most popular type in agricultural supply chain applications
    since having a balance performance, it fits most user requirements in this sector.
    Many blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric [25], MultiChain [26], Quorum
    [27] and Corda [28], can be used to deploy either consortium or private blockchain
    systems. B. Blockchain Technical Components Several essential techniques, including
    hash, asymmetric cryptography, digital signature, Merkle tree and consensus are
    utilized in the blockchain design to achieve a secure ledger with decentralized
    management. Specifically, each block has a block header and a block body. In block
    header, several elements are included, such as previous block hash value, nonce,
    Merkle tree root hash, and other information, e.g., block version and Timestamp.
    Block body holds the actual data that are either transaction records or the protected
    data. 1) Hash Function Hash function is a key technique in blockchain, which is
    used for multiple purposes, including address generation, digital signature and
    consensus. Through hash function, arbitrary size data can be easily mapped to
    fixed-size values. While inversely, it is difficult to restore the original data
    from its hash value. For example, with a given large data x , its corresponding
    hash value can be obtained by irreversible hash function, Hash(x) . If x is modified
    to x ′ in an unintended manner, the hash result Hash( x ′ ) is completely different
    from Hash(x) . Two most common hash functions used in blockchain include message
    digest 5 (MD5) and SHA256 based on the complexity of data [29]. During network
    transmission, data integrity can be verified by cryptographical hash technique.
    For example, assume Alice sends data x to Bob. Along with data x , the encrypted
    hash value Encrypt(Hash(x)) , is also enclosed. After Bob receives the data, he
    can verify data integrity by calculating the hash value from received data x ′
    , Hash( x ′ ) , and comparing it with the expected hash results decrypted from
    the received Encrypt(Hash(x)) . If Hash( x ′ )=Hash(x) , it means data is transmitted
    properly, x ′ =x . Otherwise, if Hash( x ′ )≠Hash(x) , it means data integrity
    has been broken, so Bob may ask Alice to transmit the data again. 2) Asymmetric
    Cryptography To implement verifiable transaction in distributed system, asymmetric
    cryptography technique [30] is used along with hash function to enforce digital
    signature technique. In asymmetric cryptography, each user has a pair of keys,
    i.e. private key k and public key K . The private key is kept confidentially and
    known only by the owner, while the public key could be known by the others. The
    public key can be calculated from the private key, but with given public key,
    private key cannot be obtained in reverse. The public key K and the private key
    k can encrypt and decrypt data in pairs. For example, as shown in Eqn. 1, data
    x encrypted by public key K can be decrypted by corresponding private key k .
    On the other hand, data x encrypted by private key k can also be decrypted by
    corresponding public key K . Decryp t k (Encryp t K (x))=Decryp t K (Encryp t
    k (x))=x (1) View Source Targeting different security requirements, asymmetric
    cryptography can be flexibily applied. Again, assume Alice is sending data x to
    Bob, and both of them have a pair of asymmetric key. Note, Alice and Bob know
    each other’s public key whereas their private keys are only known by themselves,
    individually. To ensure confidentiality, Alice can encrypt data x through Bob’s
    public key, Encryp t K B (x) . Hence, only Bob can decrypt the data by using his
    private key. On the other hand, to ensure authentication and non-repudiation,
    Alice should send data x encrypted by her own private key, Encryp t k A (x) .
    In this case, after receiving the transmitted data, Bob can attempt to decrypt
    it by Alice’s public key. If successful, these data are indeed sent by Alice and
    she cannot deny it. 3) Digital Signature For each blockchain transaction, digital
    signature [31] is required to avoid issued transaction being modified or denied.
    Technically, digital signature is an integrated technique utilising both hash
    function and asymmetric cryptography. Like the signature for paper documents,
    a valid digital signature ensures that an unaltered data is sent by a known sender,
    which cannot be repudiated. For this purpose, the file is firstly hashed to a
    fixed length and then encrypted by sender’s private key, and the result refers
    to the digital signature of this sender. Since only nominated sender has his own
    private key, the asymmetric cryptography technique ensures authentication and
    non-repudiation of this signature. Meanwhile, because anyone can obtain the sender’s
    public key, the integrity of signature can be verified by anyone through calculating
    the hash value from the data and comparing it with the hash value decrypted from
    the signature. Moreover, if confidentiality is also required, the data can also
    be encrypted by the public key of nominated receiver. 4) Merkle Tree Once the
    number of transactions becomes larger, doing verification by downloading all the
    antiquated transactions in blockchain consumes a large amount of storage resource.
    To address this issue, Merkle Tree technique is used to reduce the storage data
    without breaking the block’s hash [32]. Merkle Tree is a binary tree consisting
    of leaf hash nodes, intermediate hash nodes and a root hash node. In each block,
    leaf hash nodes are the hash values of individual transactions. For example, assume
    there is a block with transaction data T A , T B , T C and T D . Here comes a
    Markle Tree with 4 leaves, i.e. Hash( T A ) , Hash( T B ) , Hash( T C ) and Hash(
    T D ) . As the parents of these leaves, two intermediate hash nodes, Has h AB
    and Has h CD , are calculated as follows. Has h AB = Has h CD = Hash(Hash( T A
    )+Hash( T B )) Hash(Hash( T C )+Hash( T D )) (2) (3) View Source Finally, the
    value of root hash, which is included in the block header, is calculated by hashing
    the value of intermediate nodes, as shown in Equ. 4. Has h ABCD =Hash(Has h AB
    +Has h CD ) (4) View Source To this end, by stubbing off branches of the tree,
    old blocks can then be compacted to reduce the size of the blockchain. 5) Distributed
    Consensus Schemes Byzantine general problem [33] has been raised as a trust issue
    in distributed systems. It refers to the data tamper caused by some dishonest
    nodes under the blockchain context [34]. The consensus mechanism is proposed to
    solve the problem and protect the data from minority attacks by allocating the
    responsibility of updating data blocks to random candidates selected from all
    the nodes. The popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof
    of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    (PBFT), and Proof of Elapse Time (PoET). PoW is the first proposed scheme in the
    bitcoin to achieve consensus in peer to peer management [1]. The nodes across
    the network compete with each other to solve a cryptographic puzzle to add the
    next block into the blockchain with a small amount of incentives. This is called
    ”mining” in blockchain based cryptocurrency. Although the scheme is remarkable
    to protect the blockchain system from malicious attacks, it is a time-consuming
    and energy consumption process. Therefore, the on-chain speed (transactions per
    second) is low in the systems by using this scheme. PoS is a mechanism to use
    validators instead of miners to update the blocks [35]. The nodes must prove their
    stakes by depositing certain amount of coins in the system. The key advantage
    of the PoS over PoW is the significant reduction of the computational power. However,
    the main issue is that the nodes who have large proportion of stakes are more
    likely to become the validators of the blocks. Delegate Proof of Stake (DPoS)
    [36] is an improved version of PoS by restricting the number of validators to
    further improve the scalability of the blockchain. Block producers are voted by
    all the users who have a number of votes calculated based on their stakes on the
    network. A block is generated if two third of producers reach an agreement. Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm was initially proposed to target on
    the Byzantine general problem [37]. It highlights that the PBFT requires 3f+1
    nodes to make a correct decision if f nodes are faulty/dishonest nodes in the
    network. The algorithm has been adopted into a blockchain system as one alternative
    consensus scheme [34]. In the scheme, a block proposer is first selected based
    on a robin-round manner. The proposer will then broadcast and collect 3f+1 nodes
    in the network. If two third of the validators agree on a block proposal, the
    block is valid to commit into the blockchain. Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) is
    a more efficient mechanism compared to other consensus schemes [38]. It was developed
    by Intel on top of the SGX technology. After signing attestation, each node participates
    in a randomized lottery selection by receiving an object timer from the trusted
    code. The node who wakes first will lead the next block creation. However, the
    SGX is made by Intel which is a third-party company. This has a potential to compromize
    the principle of blockchain to remove the intermediaries. Overall, consensus scheme
    design is still an open challenge in blockchain research [39]. The selection of
    the scheme relies on the application context to balance the block on-chain speed
    as well as the robustness to against various types of attacks. C. Blockchain Generation
    Process Blockchain data on-chain process has several stages to secure data integrity.
    An example of a transaction record on-chain process is illustrated as follows:
    Stage I:Before each transaction, payee address is firstly generated, and the payer
    makes payment to that address. After the payer finishes the payment, the transaction
    is digitally signed by both the transactions parties and broadcasted to all the
    participants (i.e. peers) in the network. From the participant side, after receiving
    a new transaction, the transaction is firstly verified, and if valid, collected
    into a block. Stage II:Every participant packs the collected transaction records
    during a period into a block, and make an effort to upload his block to the blockchain.
    Regarding which participant can stand out from the peers, various distributed
    consensus schemes are introduced in previous section. Stage III:When the new uploaded
    block is connected with the existing chain, it is broadcasted to all the other
    participants in the network. After receiving the block, other participants can
    verify all transactions in the block to ensure data integrity. Since each block
    in the chain requires the hash value of the previous hash, the participants can
    express their acceptance of specific chain by using its hash to create the next
    block. With repeating these stages, all the data can be stored in the decentralized
    database sequentially. It provides a transparent environment for all the stakeholders
    so that a trusted system is built across the network. SECTION III. Blockchain
    Applications in Agricultural Sector During recent years, blockchain has attracted
    significant increasing attentions in agricultural sector. This trend is driven
    by the major concerns in several important aspects, i.e. food contamination and
    fraud issues [40], data security and safety in smart farming [41] and IoT based
    precision agriculture [3], trust and efficiency issues in financial transactions
    in the agricultural supply chain [42] and data transparency and integrity of agriculture
    related information management systems [43]. The regulation and governance seek
    for more innovations on adopting blockchain techniques to achieve better data
    transparency and accountability with flexible, costly and sustainable solutions.
    As illustrated in Figure 3, all the stakeholders involved in agricultural production
    and transaction can secure their data integrity in blockchain based systems. Thus,
    users have high confidence when using the products or the services offered by
    them. FIGURE 3. Agricultural stakeholders, including producers, logistic companies,
    manufacturers, retailers and financial institutions, can be involved to create
    blockchain applications to build up trust of data users, e.g., goverment supervisors,
    consumers, and other AI and machine learning based systems. Show All A. Application
    Categories In this subsection, a comprehensive investigation has been made to
    identify how the blockchain technology are deployed to achieve efficiency and
    integrity of agricultural applications. Based on these targeted issues, we categorize
    uses of blockchain into four groups: (i) provenance traceability and food authentication;
    (ii) smart farming data management; (iii) trade finance in the supply chain management;
    and (iv) other information management systems. 1) Provenance Traceability and
    Food Authentication: The most popular use of blockchain technology in agriculture
    is the traceability and provenance function in product supply chain management.
    It is the most efficient way to enhance food safety, and reduce fraud and food
    scandals since all relevant data related to the product origin and its movements
    can be stored with minimal tampering risk [44]. When each product item is produced,
    a corresponding digital token is attached to the item in order to ensure that
    it is tracked at a real-time manner. The developed applications include tracing
    Pork and Mango sold in Walmart supermarket [45], egg distribution from farm to
    the fork at midwestern U.S. [46], Brazilian grain export [47], the certificate
    verification of table grape shipped from Africa [48], the use of RFID tags to
    trace cold chain food [49], and the use of IoT sensor to trace products in supply
    chain [50]. Walmart is one of the pioneers to deploy blockchain on food traceability
    [45]. It worked closely with IBM to deploy two pilot studies by using Hyperledger
    Fabric. These two studies include the traceability systems for pork in Chinese
    market and mangoes in the American market. E-certificates including agricultural
    treatments, ID numbers, manufacturers, security issues, permissions and safety
    related records are all stored in the log files. With blockchain technology, procurement
    managers can trace all the information online in time, so that they can easily
    pinpoint the individual tainted products without recalling all the products. The
    systems can not only make the safety traceability much more quickly but also cut
    the recall cost by allowing to trace the items instead of batches [45]. Data and
    transactions collection procedure in the blockchain traceability systems are designed
    based on requirements of the applications. In [51], different event types defined
    in the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) specification [52],
    including ObjectEvent, AggregationEvent, QuantityEvent and TransactionEvent, are
    uploaded into the blockchain to ensure the better information traceability as
    the items and their main transaction events have unique codes. In [48] and [53],
    certification documents of the products are embedded into the transactions to
    satisfy the compliance with health and safety regulations. In other traceability
    systems, such as [49] and [50], using IoT sensors or RFID tags to automate the
    data collection could further reduce the manual mistakes for data integrity and
    improve the efficiency of data on-chain process. 2) Smart Farming Data Management
    In addition to the previous mentioned traceability systems, IoT techniques have
    also been widely used in smart farming for better productivity control and management
    [54]. In these IoT sensor-based systems, management and control decisions are
    made based on data collected from sensor networks. In [55], robotic swarm control
    is proposed as a key concept in future smart farming and precision agriculture.
    Simply put, UAVs and land robots could make either distributed or collaborative
    decisions based on data collected from robotic swarms and communications between
    them. Thus, data privacy and integrity are the most important component in such
    systems. There exists an increasing trend of migrating IoT network data from centralized
    database to blockchain systems for many applications [56], [57]. Many agricultural
    projects have benefited from the convergence of IoT and blockchain techniques.
    For example, IoT based irrigation systems are proposed in [58] and [59] and blockchain
    is deployed to keep sensing data privacy and integrity. In [60], a private blockchain
    is adopted to secure monitoring and control data in a fish farm so that all the
    control decisions are accountable. In [61], Kawakura et al. uses Corda to build
    an IoT data recording system to store data that farmers operate hoes with small
    data transaction time-delay. With the analysis on these data, farming operations
    can be optimized to increase productivity. In these applications, farmers can
    build up their trust on the automated controllers as all decisions are accountable.
    3) Efficiency Improvement of the Trade Finance in the Supply Chain blockchain
    was originally proposed to improve the financial efficiency, and reduce transaction
    cost by removing intermediaries and audit cost via improved accountability in
    trading business process [72]. This feature is powerful to support small scale
    farmers who are suffering from high cost of trade transactions and accidental
    losses caused by environmental disasters or other uncertainties [73]. Therefore,
    the straightforward use cases of blockchain in agriculture is to explore its financial
    functions to make these agricultural producers profitable. Many agriculture related
    companies are developing blockchain systems to support trading parties in supply
    chain management. In [23], an integrated food trading systems with consortium
    blockchain, called FTSCON, was built to facilitate costly and easy trading of
    agricultural products in Shandong province, China. Based on the trial between
    2014 and 2017, it was found that the total profit of different enterprises in
    the region increased significantly. In [64], a detailed solution of implementing
    a trading system in soybean supply chain was presented. It emphasized that this
    system could provide proof of delivery, automated payments and dispute handling.
    In [66], a case study was made by CBH group in Australia to secure the seven days
    payment terms via a Quorum based blockchain system. The blockchain technology
    is also under development to support agricultural finance by many financial institutions
    and commercial banks. In [67], several case studies of blockchain systems which
    were jointly developed by banks and IT companies to illustrate that the blockchain
    systems provided the letter of credit from the banks efficiently to speed up the
    trading process with much shorter period. In [65], State Farm and USAA jointly
    developed a system to facilitate the automatic insurance claims from farmers to
    reduce the fraud risk as well as improve the claim efficiency. All these innovations
    have motivated farmers to produce more products by increasing their profit margins.
    4) Other Agriculture Related Data Management Systems blockchain technology is
    considered as the next generation information infrastructure promoted by many
    countries [74]. It has made significiant impacts on both industrial and research
    projects. In food manufacture industry, a food quality monitoring system is built
    by combining smart contract and evaluation models to increase reliability of peach
    juice production process [68]. On the agricultural research side, it is also calling
    for more transparent ways to increase confidence on research results when multiple
    collaborators are involved in a project. For example, food science research society
    proposes to use blockchain to store and share collected research data [70]. Blockchain
    based systems have also been deployed in many other agriculture related information
    management systems as the backbone infrastructure. For example, in [69], a decentralized
    ledger-based contract management system is built to provide legal protection of
    the temporary agricultural workers in Italy. In addition, the payment of the salary
    can be settled via the cryptocurrency in this integrated system. In [71], Plastic
    Bank uses a blockchain based token to encourage the plastic waste collection and
    recycle to provide an innovative solution for agricultural land cleaning. B. Application
    Platform As many cryptographic techniques are used in blockchain technology, it
    is a time-consuming task to build a blockchain system from scratch for practitioners
    and researchers. As a result, many open source and commercial platforms are provided
    to simplify and speed up the decentralized application (DApp) development in agriculture
    related projects. The predominant platforms used in these blockchain practices
    are discussed as follows. Ethereum was initiated in 2014 and it is the most active
    blockchain platform in the world for blockchain practitioners and researchers
    [24]. It is a permissionless blockchain that is friendly to public blockchain
    based APP development. The access control can only be added via the smart contract
    that is limited. Many proof-of-concept agricultural traceability systems, such
    as [49], [51], [62], [63], finance trading systems, such as [23], [64], and some
    information management systems, including [68], [69], are deployed on top of the
    platform. However, there are some disadvantages of using the Ethereum platform
    for development: as shown in Table 2, the platform uses PoW as its consensus scheme,
    thus the on-chain speed is relatively low, i.e. ~20 tps [75]. Another constraint
    for DApp development on the platform is the cost when committing data and transactions
    on the blockchain via ETH gas, a unit to measure the computational use [76]. When
    building a system with intensive on-chain data, it is not economic to use this
    platform. Hyperledger is endorsed by Linux foundation to provide several distributed
    ledger frameworks, e.g., Fabric, Sawtooth, Indy, and Burrow [77], for the enterprise
    level blockchain development. In these frameworks, Hyperledger Fabric [25] and
    Hyperledger Sawtooth [78] are the two most popular platforms for the development
    of the agricultural related projects. The examples include [45], [47], [53] by
    using Fabric and [46], [50] by using Sawtooth. The default consensus scheme in
    the Fabric is PBFT while in the Sawtooth, PoET is set as the default consensus
    scheme. In addition, these are flexible to adopt any other schemes to further
    improve the on-chain speed efficiently. Regarding the performance, both platforms
    have higher on-chain transaction throughput comparing to the Ethereum. In [79],
    it uses Fabric to achieve 20,000 tps with delegate design of the architecture.
    The difference between these two platforms is that Fabric supports permissioned
    blockchain but Sawtooth support both the permissioned and permissionless blockchain
    development. Thus, the use of Hyperledger frameworks is increasing significantly
    in agricultural applications. Quorum was created by JP Morgan to target on enterprise
    level blockchain systems [27]. It provides an Ethereum based platform to support
    applications of finance, supply chain, and retails with extra protection on the
    privacy of transactions and contracts. The transaction data are encrypted to preserve
    data privacy. In addition, it offers centralized enforcement on the access control
    so that it is more suitable for private/consortium blockchain systems. Although
    the platform is built on top of Ethereum, it uses either Raft [80] or Istanbul
    BFT [81], as its consensus scheme. Therefore, the average transaction speed can
    reach ~500 to ~700 tps in average [27]. Examples of agricultural systems developed
    by using the platform include AgriDigital [66] and insurance claim [65]. TABLE
    1 A Comprehensive List of Blockchain Based Agricultural Systems and Their Implementation
    Platforms TABLE 2 Table to Summarize the Main Features and Attributes of the Popular
    Blockchain Platforms to Deploy Agricultural Applications Although there are many
    other platforms for blockchain based system development, such as Multichain [26],
    R3 Corda [28] and BigChainDB [82], these four platforms have been widely chosen
    for the deployment of agricultural systems. The main features and attributes of
    these platforms, including transaction throughput, consensus, supported smart
    contract languages, state database and access control, are summarized in Table
    2. In addition, a more comprehensive list of agricultural projects by using these
    platforms are presented in Table 1. C. Smart Contract 1) Smart Contract and Its
    Implementation Smart contract refers to a computerized program which is consisted
    of states, values, addresses and logical functions that are required at the business
    model layer in a system [83]. The idea was initialized by Nick Szabo in [84] to
    automatically execute contracts to improve efficiency of business models involved.
    As illustrated in Fig. 4, smart contract plays a key role in a blockchain system
    implementation. In specific, once it takes the transaction requests as input to
    trigger the business logic, it uses defined policy to get the endorsement from
    peers in the blockchain network. After receiving all the endorsements, it calls
    the ordering services to verify the endorsement and add the verified transactions
    into blocks of the blockchain. The records stored in the blockchain is immutable
    so that no one could tamper the on-chain data. In addition, DApps can query the
    states of accounts or transactions via the smart contract. FIGURE 4. Smart contract
    plays an important role in transaction endorsement and verification. Show All
    To support the fast blockchain application development, most blockchain platforms
    support the programming of smart contracts to fulfil the different business logics
    behind these applications. Ethereum platform and its extension platform Quorum
    provides Turing complete smart contracts: they compile either Solidity and Serpent
    code into Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) bytecodes and the EVM takes responsibility
    to track state changes to ensure Turing completion. As the most active platforms
    in Hyperledger family, Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth uses Golong, Java, Python
    and Javascript as the main programming languages for smart contract development.
    2) Challenges of Smart Contracts The challenges of smart contract is the key focus
    when blockchain technology is deployed in agricultural systems [93]. In [94],
    these challenges are summarized based on the smart contract life cycle, which
    includes creation, deployment, execution and completion stages. In the creation
    stage, function and readability issues are faced by the developers and practitioners.
    Developing human readable code and achieving expected functionality are crucial
    for accountability of smart contracts. Further, good smart contract design could
    solve the problem of under-optimized code, which could lead to extra costs in
    transactions, or under-priced operations resulting denial of service (DoS) attacks.
    In the deployment stage, contract correctness and control flow are two major factors
    that ensure high quality of smart contract. Many methods, such as bytecode analysis
    [95], formal verification [96], and graph-based analysis [97], are proposed to
    check correctness and control flow of smart contracts for deployment. In the execution
    stage, execution efficiency of smart contract must be garanteed. In [98] and [99],
    concurrent execution of smart contracts by proposing Software Transactional Memory
    based approaches can significantly improve the execution efficiency. In the final
    completion stage, security of smart contract is the most crucial factor. As discovered
    in [95], 8,833 out of 19,366 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum have serious
    security bugs that can be easily exploited. Further, 12 types of vulnerabilities
    in smart contracts are summarized in [100]. Nevertheless, it is difficult to reduce
    these secruity risks and vulnerabilities without automated tools due to the diverse
    levels of blockchain programmers. Therefore, many security analysis tools, including
    SECURIFY [101], OYENTE [95], or SMARTINSPECT [102], are developed to ensure high
    level of smart contract security for the developers [103]. For example, a decentralized
    smart contract system, the Hawk [104], provides a promising solution to compile
    a contract into a cryptographic protocol automatically. For another example, in
    [101], a publicly released security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts is developed
    as a fully automated tool to prove whether contract behaviors are safe. D. Technical
    Review of Innovative Agricultural Blockchains Recently, blockchain technologies
    have been integrated with many other advancements in IoTs, cloud computing and
    cloud storage to provide better services in agriculture. The convergence of blockchain
    and IoT, which is defined as Blockchain of Things (BCoT) in [105], has become
    one of the most useful frameworks in blockchain applications. In many data intensive
    applications, e.g., tracking and recording continuous signals from IoT devices,
    achieving optimized performance is challenging. This is due to various theoretical
    limitations and bottlenecks of blockchain. For example, conventional blockchain
    systems have a low on-chain speed due to their decentralized feature and consensus
    schemes [106]. Once the volume of real-time captured data are higher than transaction
    capacity, low throughput hinders the practice of blockchain technology. Thus,
    many novel agricultural blockchain systems with technical innovations are proposed
    to ensure better integration to enhance data throughput, security and fast retrieval
    of the shared data in agriculture sector when keeping the main features of blockchain,
    i.e. traceability, immutability, and data integrity. Some key studies are highlighted
    in the Table 3. These studies are categorized into three areas. TABLE 3 A Summary
    Table of Representative Technical Innovations in Agricultural Blockchain Applications
    First, many studies aim to improve the underlying elements of blockchain technology,
    focusing on the following key ideas: (1) nodes are grouped into clusters to improve
    the scalability of the BCoT architecture [87], [88]. In [88], Qu et. al. propose
    the reduction of data storage to tackle scalability related issues. It clusters
    the nodes into geometric groups so that data partitioning scheme can be deployed
    to reduce data redudancy. (2) Double chain architecture is used to store data
    in different types of blockchains [51], [85]. In [85] and [51], DoubleChain, a
    hybrid system of on-chain and off-chain data storage, is proposed to solve the
    throughput bottleneck. (3) smart contract filtering algorithm is designed to reduce
    the on-chain data. For example, in [60], a smart contract-based data filtering
    algorithm is proposed to build a blockchain based fish farming solution on top
    of a legacy database system. With the filtering algorithm, only important data
    are uploaded into the blockchain blocks. (4) consensus schemes that are too complex
    to be handled well in large IoT networks are improved to further boost blockchain
    performance. In [87], a Distributed Time-based Consensus algorithm (DTC) is proposed
    to reduce the processing overhead. While in [23], Mao et al. design an improved
    (iPBFT) scheme to make the consensus better suited for relatively higher throughput.
    Secondly, combining different data storage techniques is another important strategy
    to tackle the exponentially increasing data storage used in many agricultural
    applications. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed
    data storage system in which data content is stored in distributed peers and its
    hash value is used to ensure data integrity [107]. The combination of IPFS and
    blockchain has become a popular approach to tackle the weakness of blockchain
    technique to store large amount of data [64], [89], [90]. For instance, as multimedia
    data have increased significantly in agricultural applications, IPFS has been
    used in [64] to store videos and images to complement with blockchain so that
    the multimedia evidence, including images and MPEG videos, can be stored securely
    to resolve rebuttals in soybean transactions. In addition, mixture with decentralized
    database cluster is another option to solve the high volume storage problem. In
    [91], Golden Seed Breeding Cloud Platform (GSBCP) is designed to ensure the safe
    storage of crop breeding. A decentralized database cluster is used to store the
    raw data collected from multiple sensors; and the database addresses and relevant
    metadata are uploaded into the blockchain, thus maintaining data integrity. Thirdly,
    blockchain privacy and security is another focus of recent research. In many agriculture
    related applications, enhanced privacy and security components are added in their
    systems, e.g., [86], [91], [92]. In [91], the summary of breeding data is encrypted
    by using proxy encryption server before uploading into the blockchain. In [86],
    an improved partial blind signature algorithm is proposed to protect data privacy.
    In [92], an architecture with decentralized access control is proposed to enhance
    security of IoT device data. SECTION IV. Challenges and Potential Solutions The
    major technological challenges can be summarized as the following aspects: (i)
    scalability issue when integrating with data intensive technology, such as IoT.
    The throughput of blockchain is much lower than the conventional centralized databases,
    which can achieve tens to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Therefore,
    the data-intensive applications, e.g. monitoring and controlling farming by sensor
    network, require fast storage speed and low network latency; (ii) integration
    with existing legacy systems. Many organizations have deployed their own management
    systems for years and it is hard to migrate their entire systems to the emerging
    blockchain which could cause disruption to their current services; and (iii) security
    and privacy. Blockchain encourage the decentralized infrastructure which increases
    the data transparency but compromise the data privacy. Although most recent blockchain
    platforms allow the uploading of encrypted transaction records on-chain, more
    security features would enhance the data security and privacy to a higher level
    due to various types of attacks [108]. Based on the technical innovations discussed
    in the previous section, the potential solutions for solving these challenges
    are summarized and illustrated in Figure 5. FIGURE 5. The alternative solutions
    to target on several challenges in state-of-the-art frameworks. Show All As illustrated
    in Figure 5a, the use of a hybrid architecture solution by combining centralized
    databases or other data storage systems with blockchain is proposed in many studies
    [85], [91], [109], [110]. Although some applications focus on designing light-weight
    data structure to reduce the on-chain data amount [51], [86], the mixture and
    links of blockchain with other storage systems, such as IPFS, provides a more
    scalable and sustainable way to deal with the exponential increase of data that
    most modern storage solutions are facing. The hybrid architecture can solve the
    demand of high throughput data storage requirement while maintaining data integrity.
    Integration with legacy systems is another challenge when promoting blockchain
    technology in agricultural organizations. In [13], it is highlighted that the
    blockchain systems are difficult to seamlessly integrate with legacy systems.
    We believe that the popular use of cloud services in most enterprises could potentially
    solve this issue. As illustrated in Figure 5b, when data from legacy systems in
    individual companies are uploaded in cloud services, service providers can easily
    extend their services to blockchain based systems if any business needs are proposed
    between multiple parties. In addition, the organizations could save the cost to
    enhance data privacy and security as the risks could be efficiently controlled
    and managed by the service providers. To further enhance blockchain privacy and
    security, an infrastructure level solution is more suitable for tackling the challenge.
    As illustrated in Figure 5c and 5d, two types of blockchain structure changes
    could potentially enhance data privacy and security. In Figure 5c, a hierarchical
    blockchain based system is proposed as the private blockchain has better characteristics
    to maintain data privacy. Only data required by legislation or regulation bodies
    are stored into a consortium blockchain. Figure 5d offers another enhanced version
    in Figure 5c. It uses efficient chain-to-chain communication technology to remove
    the consortium blockchain, thus further maintaining data privacy in private blockchains.
    Of course, the communication scheme across multiple private blockchains need be
    secured as proposed [111]. In addition to these technical challenges, there are
    other challenges in environmental, social and organizational aspects [112] to
    promote blockchain technology in agricultural sector. There are still lack of
    regulatory and legal requirements to reinforce the deployment of blockchain based
    systems. Thus, some enterprises are reluctant to adopt the technology if their
    current systems can satisfy their business needs. Further, it requires knowledge
    and skills on both agriculture and blockchain to develop these applications. However,
    it is predictable that the use of blockchain to build trustable systems would
    be predominant in many countries and these challenges would need to be addressed
    in near future [113]. SECTION V. An Illustration of Essential Food Supply in Post-COVID-19
    Pandemic In this section, we present an illustration to demonstrate a blockchain
    based food supply chain management system in agricultural applications. The ongoing
    COVID-19 pandemic has brought a huge crisis on the global food supply [114] despite
    many existing blockchain systems in agricultural supply chain. During this period,
    shortage of essential food, such as rice, fresh vegetables, flour, and eggs, has
    caused panics among suppliers and shoppers due to disruptions in supply networks.
    Producers, manufacturers and distributors have limited information when customers’
    shopping behaviours change abruptly. It takes weeks, even months, to adjust resource
    allocation in order to recover the operations of food product supply to a normal
    level. Further development of blockchain based supply chain systems is required
    to improve the situation by tackling issues related to asymmetric information.
    There are at least three key lessons that we could learn from COVID-19 related
    global food supply disruptions. These include: (1) we need real-time accurate
    information for parties involved. When panic buying occurs, the supply network
    lacks of accurate information to reflect the purchase behaviours, thus making
    quick responses impossible. (2) More efficient coordination among parties at a
    global scale is necessary in order to generate quick and appropriate responses
    in real-time. (3) Efficient process is needed to reduce time in bureaucracy procedures.
    These lessons motivate us to reform the existing blockchain based supply chain
    systems to provide better services in future. As shown in Figure 6, we illustrate
    an improved blockchain based supply chain system that can be deployed in post
    COVID-19 era. The blockchain technique will be seamlessly integrated with machine
    learning methods to achieve a more efficient system. Like other existing blockchain
    system, the provenance of products, including essential information and certificates,
    is stored in the blockchain for traceability. In such a system, retailers are
    information consumers not providers. In this improved system, the main distinctive
    and unique feature is the integration of retailer and customer data into the blockchain.
    Insight analyses of key weaknesses of current supply chain management systems
    have identified that the involvement of these retailer/consumer data is valuable
    to boost the effectiveness of the blockchain based system. If shopping data can
    be uploaded into the system, up-chain parties, including producers, manufacturers
    and logistic companies, could explore these data for better coordination and resource
    allocations. Thus, a closed loop could be formed when retailers/customers’ data
    are stored into the blockchain. The main features are highlighted as follows.
    FIGURE 6. Use Case - Improved post-COVID-19 blockchain based supply chain solution.
    Show All Using AI based retail sales prediction to reduce on-chain data. Retail
    forecasting has offered an oppotunity to optimize retailers’ planning to maximize
    their profitable margins by setting reasonable inventory level based on popularity
    of products [115]. Recent research has shown some extent of success in product-level
    demand forecasting at a high granularity level. The demanding prediction of products
    can be integrated as a filtering method to reduce on-chain data of the proposed
    blockchain system. In Algorithm 1, the pseudocode of data registration function
    in RetailerData smart contract is used as an example to show how data collected
    from retailers can be uploaded on the blockchain system. Here, the AL refers to
    the authentized list that all registered retailer units can upload their data
    to improve the up-chain strategical optimization, and the p refers to individual
    products that supply process need to be optimized. With an AI module filtering
    normal sales prediction, the on-chain data can be reduced significantly. At the
    same time, any anomaly or significant customer behaviour changes are recorded
    into the blockchain so that up-chain parties could explore the data for efficient
    planning. SECTION Algorithm 1 Data Registration Function in RetailerData Smart
    Contract Input: Message sender (msg.sender), authentification list (AL) of retailer
    units, product object (p) including all sales infomation of the product, current
    time (t). Output: Data registered 1: if msg.sender ∈ AL && abs(p.real_sale−ai_module.predict())>th
    then 2: register(msg.sender,p,t) 3: else if msg.sender ∈ AL then 4: register(msg.sender,p.id,normal_flag,t)
    5: else 6: Revert contract state and show error 7: end if 8: return p The blockchain
    retailer data facilitate better planning and operation of upchain stakeholders,
    such as suppliers, manufacturers and logistic companies. As illustrated in Fig.
    7, up-chain parties could request these retailer data to feed into their AI modules
    to optimize their planning and operations. For examples, logistic companies could
    request data of retailer units and their demands of products to make routing optimization
    based on the geographic distribution of demand; manufacturers could use the data
    to adjust their raw material processing to meet urgent market demands; and farmers
    could make better planning for future productivity. FIGURE 7. The retailer/consumer
    data are important to improve efficiency of the food product supply chain. Show
    All The blockchain retailer data improve work priority of government and regulation
    bodies. As illustrated in Fig. 7, once government and regulation bodies have the
    permission to access regional data on demand, policy makers could set priorities
    and coordinate with all involving parties more efficiently to deal with unexpected
    events like COVID-19. Further, as shown in Fig. 6, quality control agents and
    food administration agency could work closely with producers and manufacturers
    so that a lengthy quality monitoring and auditing process can be simplified. SECTION
    VI. Discussions and Conclusion Blockchain technology, as a part of the emerging
    e-agriculture system, is reshaping the whole sector to solve food crisis in new
    century. It plays key roles from the farm to the folk in many aspects: it ensures
    data privacy and integrity by combining smart farming and precision agriculture
    techniques to improve farm productivity; it creates a more efficient food supply
    chain by establishing trust among involving parties, thus simplifying the process;
    and the last not the least, it enables farmers to maximize their profit via a
    trusted platform. Overall, it adds great values to all stakeholders in the entire
    agricultural sector. In this paper, to promote blockchain techniques, especially
    their various uses in the ecosystem of agricultural products, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey on current blockchain based agricultural applications and
    innovations. We have explained various concepts of blockchain technology, including
    its data storage ecosystem and its several popular application platforms. We have
    offered a detailed investigation of desperate blockchain applications in the agricultural
    sector. Then, we have considered several key challenges in the current use of
    blockchain related technologies in agricultural applications and provided some
    possible solutions. These challenges include: (1) scalability, (2) integration
    with existing legacy systems, and (3) security and privacy. Simply put, our suggested
    solutions can be viewed in a holistic fashion as a redesign of the system architecture.
    Further, we have indicated possible future developments and applications of blockchain
    in this sector via an illustration, i.e. the current COVID-19 global food crisis.
    In future, we wish to provide further discussions on various aspects of blockchain
    and explain in detail how current challenges as indicated in this paper can be
    resolved in future development of blockchain in agricultural systems. Potentially,
    our illustration could be further extended to be a much fuller case study, which
    could then be evaluated via a series of emperical tests. Authors Figures References

    Footnotes Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing
    blockchain protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We start by describing
    the blockchains and summarizing the existing surveys that deal with blockchain
    technologies. Then, we provide an overview of the application domains of blockchain
    technologies in IoT, e.g., Internet of Vehicles, Internet of Energy, Internet
    of Cloud, Edge computing, etc. Moreover, we provide a classification of threat
    models, which are considered by blockchain protocols in IoT networks, into five
    main categories, namely identity-based attacks, manipulation-based attacks, cryptanalytic
    attacks, reputation-based attacks, and service-based attacks. In addition, we
    provide a taxonomy and a side-by-side comparison of the state-of-the-art methods
    toward secure and privacy-preserving blockchain technologies with respect to the
    blockchain model, specific security goals, performance, limitations, computation
    complexity, and communication overhead. Based on the current survey, we highlight
    open research challenges and discuss possible future research directions in the
    blockchain technologies for IoT. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal

    and content Highlights • There is a growing interest in applying blockchain technology
    in supply chain operations. • Research on blockchain configuration receives less
    attention as compared to others, such as impact and function. • Discussion on
    sustainability is limited as compared to other themes. • More research should
    be carried out under the themes of coordination, performance and order management.
    • The voices of different stakeholders should be considered in academic research.
    Abstract In the past few years, blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin,
    has received considerable attention from academia and industry. It is widely accepted
    that blockchain technology causes disruptive changes in supply chain operations
    that can overcome supply chain difficulties encountered in realizing information
    sharing, maintaining traceability in the entire process and improving operational
    efficiency. However, the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain
    field is still in its infancy, which limits an understanding of its potential.
    This article uses descriptive and content analysis to review publications related
    to blockchain-based supply chains between 2017 and 2020 inclusive. To fully explore
    research on blockchain-based supply chains, four well-designed questions are proposed
    and addressed, namely, the value of blockchain in supply chains, the attraction
    of scholars to particular supply chain themes, the development of research methodologies
    and illustration types in adopting blockchain in supply chains, and the types
    of industries involved in blockchain-based supply chains. The results reveal that
    there is growing interest in applying blockchain technology to supply chain operations.
    A detailed analysis of findings is provided to identify the future opportunities
    of blockchain-based supply chains, including prospects for tertiary industries
    and concerted efforts that are necessary to explore sustainability themes. This
    article provides valuable information to help scholars and practitioners better
    determine the relevant research topics to accelerate the development of blockchain-based
    supply chains. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Supply
    chainBlockchainDescriptive and content analysisLiterature review 1. Introduction
    In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published his study on “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic
    Cash System”, in which a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash system was proposed
    (Nakamoto, 2008). This system allowed payments to be directly initiated by one
    party and sent to the other without a third-party financial institution (Rana
    et al., 2019). In recent years, with increasing attention to digital cryptocurrencies
    such as Bitcoin, scholars have gradually realized the important role of blockchain,
    which is a crucial underlying technology of Bitcoin (Kumar et al., 2020, Nawari
    and Ravindran, 2019). Blockchain technology is a distribution database in which
    the use of cryptography technology guarantees that the distributed ledger cannot
    be changed, and smart contracts composed of script code enable transactions to
    be automatically executed (Juma et al., 2019, Kshetri, 2018). Currently, the application
    of blockchain technology is mainly concentrated in the financial field, but it
    also leads to disruptive changes in non-financial fields, such as e-commerce,
    e-government, credit evaluation and supply chains (Allen et al., 2019, Hald and
    Kinra, 2019, Juma et al., 2019). Supply chain management is a comprehensive management
    problem involving information flow, capital flow, logistics and business flow
    that establishes a dynamic collaborative relationship between suppliers, manufacturers,
    retailers and end users (Mou et al., 2018). There are several problems with current
    supply chain management. First, supply chain information is isolated within an
    enterprise, which leads to information silos (Jiang & Ke, 2019). Upstream and
    downstream enterprises expand the information, causing a bullwhip effect (Jeong
    & Hong, 2019). Second, the opacity of information in the supply chain reduces
    the trust between parties and hinders the exchange of real information (Jia et
    al., 2020). Third, product tracking is difficult, and particular difficulties
    arise in finding the source of the problem when counterfeit and inferior products
    appear (Zhang & Guin, 2020). Blockchain technology is very suitable for solving
    these challenges faced by the supply chain since it can ensure the authenticity
    and traceability of information during transmission and the security of transactions
    in a distrusted environment (Helo and Hao, 2019, Tijan et al., 2019). These characteristics
    have a substantial impact on supply chain management and affect the design, organization,
    and operations of the supply chain (Hald and Kinra, 2019, Kamble et al., 2019).
    Some scholars conducted studies on the blockchain-based supply chain to explore
    the potential of blockchain. For example, Wang et al. (2019) conducted a literature
    review to determine the value of blockchain for supply chain management in four
    areas that encompassed: extended visibility and traceability, supply chain digitalization
    and disintermediation, improved data security and smart contracts. Philipp et
    al. (2019) identified potential applications of smart contracts in multinational
    and multi-mode supply chains through expert interviews and case studies. Even
    if there are some related studies, it should be clearly recognized that these
    types of studies are still in the early stages, and related academic articles
    are not fruitful (Pournader et al., 2020). In addition to academic publications,
    industry is also exploring the application of blockchain in supply chains. In
    the food industry, Wal-Mart has established a traceability system for mangoes
    that improves food traceability and shortens the traceability time of mangoes
    from farm to store from the original seven days to the current two seconds (Wong
    et al., 2020). In the trade industry, Maersk and IBM cooperated to use blockchain
    technology to solve problems in cross-border supply chains because it increases
    information transparency and realizes information sharing among trading partners
    (Chang et al., 2020). Despite the aforementioned academic and practical concerns,
    the understanding of the impact of blockchain technology on supply chains is still
    limited. To better understand the value of blockchain, identify the current research
    content, and determine a research agenda for the future, this article reviews
    publications related to blockchain-based supply chains. Some articles have carried
    out literature reviews about blockchain-based supply chains, and the articles
    reviewed here are presented in Table 1: five articles focused on food supply chains
    (Antonucci et al., 2019, Chen et al., 2020, Duan et al., 2020, Feng et al., 2020,
    Feng et al., 2020, Zhao et al., 2019), two articles reviewed the transportation
    field (Astarita et al., 2020, Pournader et al., 2020), and the remaining four
    articles did not have a specific application background (Gurtu and Johny, 2019,
    Queiroz et al., 2019, Wamba and Queiroz, 2020, Wang et al., 2019, Wang et al.,
    2019, Wang et al., 2019). These articles analyzed the value, current trends and
    future opportunities from the perspective of the impact of blockchain on supply
    chains. To the best of our knowledge, no literature review has been carried out
    that considers the four aspects proposed in this article, including supply chain
    themes, research methodologies, illustration types and industries addressed. In
    addition, this article also discusses the value that blockchain will bring to
    the supply chains through the content of the existing research works, which has
    great significance for the technology at its early stage of development. This
    article aims to answer the following questions to provide research insights for
    scholars and practitioners. Table 1. Review of the previously published literature.

    the research methodology. The descriptive analysis and content analysis of the
    reviewed articles are described in Section 4. Section 5 explores future research
    opportunities. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusion. 2. Value of blockchain
    This section illustrates the value of blockchain for supply chains, that is, the
    benefits that blockchain brings to supply chains. The definition and attributes
    of blockchain technology are introduced in Section 2.1. A review of the functions
    of basic blockchain technologies provides further insights to explore the relationship
    of blockchain and supply chains in Section 2.2. 2.1. Blockchain technology In
    technical terms, blockchain refers to a distributed ledger composed of a series
    of data blocks that are linked through cryptographic methods (Zachariadis et al.,
    2019). Each block records a batch of network transaction information; the structure
    of a block is shown in Fig. 1. A block consists of a block header and a block
    body (Liu & Li, 2020). The block header holds information used to connect to the
    previous block and information used for verification, including the version number,
    the hash value of the previous block, the timestamp of the current block writing
    time, the nonce and difficulty target used to prove the difficulty of the workload,
    and a total hash of Merkle tree root for verifying the block body transaction
    (Azzi et al., 2019). The block body contains transaction information and the Merkle
    trees of all the transaction information (Pandey & Litoriya, 2020). In Fig. 1,
    “T” is used to represent “transaction.” Download : Download high-res image (390KB)

    network, any two nodes can conduct transactions, and each transaction is broadcast
    by a single node to all nodes on the entire network (Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020).
    Transaction information is linked in the blockchain when all nodes confirm that
    the records are correct, and this process relies on the consensus mechanism of
    the blockchain network (Feng et al., 2020). The distributed structure enables
    each node to record all transaction information, and each node updates and stores
    all the information of the entire network in real time (Hughes et al., 2019).
    Blockchain technology involves three technological innovations, namely, cryptography,
    consensus mechanisms and smart contracts. (1) Cryptography technologies, including
    the hash function and public key cryptography, are the basic technologies used
    to ensure the security of the blockchain system and are used in data structures,
    verification methods, communication protocols, and information storage (Wang et
    al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019). The hash function guarantees the integrity, authenticity
    and immutability of the distributed ledger data through the hash value and hash
    pointer, and it can convert the input data into a fixed-length digest through
    a hash algorithm, whose process is irreversible (Maesa & Mori, 2020). Public key
    cryptography is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that is used to provide identity
    verification to the blockchain network (Lopez & Farooq, 2020). Public key cryptography
    effectively solves the problem of key distribution and exchange in network communications,
    which ensures the security of information transmission (Ali et al., 2019). (2)
    The consensus mechanism proves the ownership and accuracy of the bookkeeping nodes
    through a consensus algorithm that solves consistency problems. This mechanism
    establishes trust between different nodes in the blockchain system and guarantees
    that each transaction remains consistent for all nodes (Feng et al., 2020). With
    the development of blockchain technology, many consensus algorithms have been
    developed, such as proof of work (POW), proof of stake (POS), and practical byzantine
    fault tolerance (PBFT). (3) A smart contract is a set of promises defined in digital
    form; the contract content is fixed in the blockchain in the form of code, and
    eventually, an automatically executed script is generated (Tanwar et al., 2020).
    Each transaction is processed by a smart contract, and the corresponding contract
    terms can be executed automatically once a predefined condition is triggered (Abdullah
    et al., 2020). This process does not require a third party, which has an enormous
    impact on the design of business models (Zhu et al., 2020). A smart contract can
    be used to model various types of businesses, organizational behaviours and rules
    in the real world and affects interactions among various entities, including the
    transfer of asset ownership, payments of digital assets and currency transactions
    (Wang et al., 2019). 2.2. Blockchain and supply chain relationship The three major
    aspects of blockchain technologies that create value, namely, shareable, secure
    and smart attributes, are summarized according to the analysis of the aforementioned
    blockchain technology, namely, cryptography, consensus mechanism and smart contracts.
    2.2.1. Shareability Blockchain uses a P2P network model, which means that the
    resources and services are distributed across all nodes, allowing each node to
    obtain a copy of the same distributed ledger achieving the data sharing (Drljevic
    et al., 2020, Savelyev, 2018). This mechanism guarantees that a transaction conducted
    by any node requires all nodes to jointly verify the transaction, thus ensuring
    the integrity of the data in the entire network. At the same time, this distributed
    system can better prevent hackers from attacking, and it does not affect the operation
    of the entire system even if individual nodes are attacked. Azzi et al. (2019)
    pointed out that blockchain technology can prevent data fraud caused by data centralization
    in a traditional supply chain because it uses a distributed system that eliminates
    intermediaries. This process also occurs for supply chain finance, which allows
    parties in supply chains to directly carry out activities, such as transfers,
    payments and stock transactions in a secure manner without financial service providers
    (Chen & Wang, 2020). Furthermore, Toennissen and Teuteberg (2020) claimed that
    the elimination of intermediaries reduces the time and cost of transactions. In
    a traditional supply chain, another issue that needs attention is information
    fragmentation between participants, and blockchain is regarded as a promising
    technology that can solve this problem (Gonczol et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2019).
    Longo et al. (2019) concluded that data sharing through blockchain technology
    helped upstream enterprises gain a deeper understanding of the needs of downstream
    customers, which helped enterprises make better decisions. At the same time, the
    ability to obtain timely data can improve procurement management, production management,
    transportation management, inventory management and many other links in a supply
    chain, thereby improving the overall level of supply chain management (Cole et
    al., 2019). In addition, the mode of common recording across the entire network
    allows each permitted modification to be observed in real time, which shortens
    the response time (Nayak & Dhaigude, 2019). Blockchain technology makes intermediaries
    unnecessary and allows for data sharing, making it suitable for large and complex
    supply chain networks, such as those used for international trade, in which a
    large number of stakeholders are involved (Bai and Sarkis, 2020, Cole et al.,
    2019). According to Chang et al. (2020), there are two problems related to traditional
    international trade that need to be urgently solved. The first is that the processing
    platforms used for international trade are mostly centralized, which limits transactions.
    The second is that hard copies are required for all documents required for cross-border
    transportations, so there may be delays, losses, and misplacement, which affect
    the operational efficiency. Liu and Li (2020) considered that the application
    of blockchain can be used to develop digital solutions and could enhance the ability
    to share transaction records in real time across the network to improve operational
    efficiency. 2.2.2. Security The security of the blockchain system is protected
    at three levels. First, decentralization eliminates the possibility of data tampering
    (Schmidt & Wagner, 2019). Second, the use of cryptographic technology guarantees
    data security and ensures that information cannot be modified without authorization
    (Lu, 2018). Finally, the consensus mechanism provides protection for the entire
    network by requiring all nodes on the network to adhere to consistent protocols
    (Singh & Kim, 2018). Behnke and Janssen (2020) claimed that information and product
    security are improved through blockchain-based supply chain management. From the
    perspective of information security, trust among participants is not high due
    to the lack of transparency in traditional supply chains (Feng et al., 2020, Mao
    et al., 2018). Di Vaio and Varriale (2020) pointed out that blockchain technology
    prevents information from being changed, which reduces the risk of the supply
    chain and thus improves trust between the supply chain participants. Blockchain
    guarantees data integrity by ensuring fixed information (on raw materials, processes
    and operators), item flow information (changes in different locations) and changes
    in ownership information (Lambourdiere & Corbin, 2020). Other types of information
    can be collected according to actual needs. Blockchain technology enhances product
    safety (Ding et al., 2020). Effective enterprises have realized that high product
    transparency enhances consumer trust, which is a competitive advantage (Wang et
    al., 2019). Kamble et al. (2020) illustrated that transparency is essential to
    ensure product authenticity and improve product traceability. The increase in
    transparency in blockchain technology depends on two aspects. The first aspect
    is the timestamp in the block, which provides chronological proof of a series
    of transactions (Hyla & Pejas, 2020). The second aspect is the integration of
    modern sensors into blockchain, such as radio frequency identification (RFID)
    and a global positioning system (GPS) (Helo & Shamsuzzoha, 2020). Blockchain technology
    creates a block for each link of goods that follows processes from manufacturing
    to sales, and these blocks are connected to record information on the entire process
    (Azzi et al., 2019). Information cannot be changed once the blocks are formed,
    and this process ensures traceability and thus product safety (Galvez et al.,
    2018, O''Leary, 2017, Yong et al., 2020). With the deterioration of the environment,
    people are favouring low-carbon products more, but it is difficult to define them
    in traditional supply chain systems (Manupati et al., 2020). Blockchain technology
    can track the raw materials of products and the carbon emissions of the entire
    process of a product, which is conducive to customers’ green consumption (Saberi
    et al., 2019). At present, IBM and the Energy Blockchain Lab have jointly developed
    a carbon asset platform using blockchain technology to help organizations measure
    their carbon footprint and facilitate the trading of carbon assets (IBM, 2018).
    2.2.3. Smart capabilities The smart capabilities of blockchain are reflected in
    smart contracts, which is considered a revolutionary application. Singh et al.
    (2020) introduced smart contracts embedded in a blockchain network; contract terms
    can be automatically executed to achieve internal interaction between participants
    when the execution conditions are triggered. Smart contracts are executed quickly,
    which improves operational efficiency, and the rights and interests of the participants
    are protected through the contract terms (Macrinici et al., 2018). Liu and Li
    (2020) proposed that smart contracts reduce paperwork and labour by eliminating
    contract registration and monitoring processes, which reduce operating costs and
    improve the efficiency of supply chains. The contract terms agreed upon by supply
    chain participants are fixed in the coding used for smart contracts, which define
    the statement obligations, benefits, and penalties, and the terms are enforced
    when the conditions for execution are met (Dolgui et al., 2020). For example,
    in a cash-on-delivery smart contract, the stakeholders realize automatic settlement
    when the goods are successfully stored in the warehouse. This high degree of automation
    makes blockchain technology particularly suitable for multi-tier supplier networks
    with complex relationships; in this context, it is difficult to track the status
    of the business and settle payments. Smart contracts can be used to organize the
    financial situation of the entire supply chain network and establish connections
    for transactions between different currencies so that each participant is paid
    (Pournader et al., 2020). At the same time, the use of smart contracts can prevent
    the risk of default and ensure that the trading parties fulfil their obligations
    (Min, 2019). Transactions are carried out within a safe and controllable range,
    as the clearing of the funds of both parties is solidified (Dolgui et al., 2020).
    Smart contracts should be established for the different links in a supply chain
    system and can be used for purchase contracts, transportation contracts, and storage
    contracts. Each contract has its own stated variables, and if any changes occur,
    information is automatically sent to the stakeholders of the contact. Any entity
    that needs other relevant information can obtain the corresponding power by registering
    events in the relevant contract. This approach also ensures information flow throughout
    the supply chain (Panescu & Manta, 2018). 3. Research methodology This section
    describes the research methodology used for the literature review, which consists
    of article screening and article coding. 3.1. Article screening Relevant high-quality
    articles were considered to provide reliable insights into the research questions.
    Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Google Scholar are the three most important
    citation databases. WoS is considered to be a more reliable international academic
    journal database than the other two sources and covers the most high-quality research
    articles (Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). To further improve the quality
    and rigour of the search for articles, the types of articles reviewed were limited
    to those published in peer-reviewed academic journals and articles that focus
    only on technology, Bitcoin and finance were excluded to make the analysis effective.
    This study used “blockchain” and “supply chain” as the query string. To further
    expand the relevant research content, other query strings related to supply chains
    were identified after a consultation among the authors: “transport”, “logistics”,
    “cross-border trade” and “manufacturing.” All articles with these query strings
    in theme were selected. The term blockchain can be traced back to 2008, but it
    was only used in the financial field in the beginning. In June 2017, the first
    academic journal article related to the combination of blockchain and supply chains
    was published. Hence, the range of the timeframe that was searched was set to
    June 2017 to March 2020. Each article was independently reviewed by four authors
    in the article screening stage. The four authors exchanged opinions to determine
    the selected articles after completing the review. This method reduces individual
    subjective bias and makes the results more rigorous. Table 2 lists the three stages
    used to screen the articles: theme search, type screening and content screening.
    This table also lists the screening criteria. In the first stage, theme search,
    421 articles were selected. After filtering by article type, 198 articles were
    identified. Finally, 106 valid articles remained after content screening. Table
    2. Criteria used to screen the articles. Stage Details Theme search (4 2 1) -Database:WoS
    core collection -Language: English -Time range: June 2017 to March 2020 -Query
    strings: “blockchain” AND【“supply chain” OR “transport” OR “logistics” OR “cross-border
    trade” OR “manufacturing”】 -Search space:Theme Type screening (1 9 8) -According
    to the theme search, the articles in the WoS database are initially selected.
    -Delete conference papers, books, comments and editing notes, only journal papers
    are retained. Content screening (1 0 6) -Read the title and abstracts to judge
    the relevance. -In addition, read the contents of the articles selected in the
    previous step to judge the relevance 3.2. Article coding The coding method used
    in this study is based on the four-dimensional coding proposed by Ghadimi et al.
    (2019) including supply chain themes, research methodologies, illustration types
    and application industries. The selected 106 articles discussed in Section 3.1
    were coded according to the above four dimensions to obtain the four angles of
    content analysis described in Section 4. In the coding process, a problem arises
    that deserves attention: defining the category to which the article belongs is
    a subjective process. Therefore, the guidelines proposed by Wang et al. (2019)
    to double-check the categories were adopted to ensure the rigour and objectivity
    of the classification process. The specific process used is as follows: The first
    author and the second author completed the coding. If there was any inconsistency
    in the coding, the third author participated in the coding and all the authors
    made the final decision together. Here, Zheng et al. (2020) is used as an example
    to introduce the specific coding process. These scholars studied the risk decision-making
    problem in a spacecraft supply chain under decentralized, partially centralized
    and fully centralized situations using blockchain. (1) Supply chain themes. The
    study discussed the risk issues in supply chains, so it belongs to the risk category
    in terms of the specific impact of the blockchain. (2) Research methodologies.
    The study used the Stackelberg game model to explore the profit in three situations,
    so it belongs to the modelling category for mathematical models. (3) Illustration
    types. The use of mathematical models means the study used numerical experiments.
    (4) Industries addressed. The study analyzed a spacecraft production supply chain,
    which obviously belongs to the manufacturing industry category. 4. Findings and
    discussions This section discusses the descriptive and content analysis of the
    106 selected articles as described in Section 3.1, leading to the findings and
    discussion. Basic information on the articles, including publications per year,
    main journals and countries, is described in the descriptive analysis (Section
    4.1). Moreover, content analysis is carried out to analyze the current research
    content based on the four coding dimensions proposed in Section 3.2: including
    supply chain themes (Section 4.2), research methodologies (Section 4.3), illustration
    types (Section 4.4) and industries addressed (Section 4.5). 4.1. Publications
    per year, main journals and countries Table 3 shows the number of articles published
    in related fields since 2017, and the articles are divided into research articles
    and review articles. The overall trend indicates that the number of published
    articles increased year by year, showing that scholars'' research interest has
    gradually increased. The timeframe considered in this study ends with 2020.03.31.
    The number of articles published reached 43 in the first quarter of 2020; therefore,
    the number of articles published throughout the year is expected to exceed 150.
    It can be seen that review articles have appeared since 2019. This is because
    research on the combination of blockchain and supply chain has just started, and
    the previous research results are not rich enough to support the completion of
    review articles. As the research deepens, the number of review articles will rapidly
    increase. Table 3. Number of articles per year. Types 2017 2018 2019 2020 Research

    are analyzed. The 106 articles considered in this study were published in 45 journals,
    covering areas including computer science, information science, environmental
    science, engineering, manufacturing, operations management, and business management.
    Fig. 2 lists the top ten journals, in which abbreviations (“Int.” for International
    and “Trans.” for Transportation) are used to represent the reported journals.
    The largest number of publications appeared in the International Journal of Information
    Management and IEEE Access, both of which published 12 articles. The impact factors
    of these two journals are 13.17 and 6.17, respectively, which means they are influential.
    Therefore, they are likely to become high-level journals in the field of blockchain-based
    supply chains attracting a large number of submissions in related fields. It is
    worth noting that a large number of articles have not been published in supply
    chain and logistics journals, such as Supply Chain Management: An International
    Journal and Transportation Research Part E-Logistics and transportation review.
    It is speculated that the number of studies on blockchain-based supply chains
    published in these two journals will grow rapidly. Download : Download high-res

    the number of articles. The 106 articles considered in this study come from 31
    countries, so the topic of blockchain-based supply chains has attracted the attention
    of scholars from various countries, and research has been carried out on a global
    scale. Table 4 shows the top eight countries with the total number of published
    articles. China published 23.58% of the total articles, ranking first in the world.
    This is because blockchain has risen to national strategic importance in China,
    and various departments, provinces and cities have also actively issued relevant
    documents to support the development of the blockchain industry (China Blockchain
    Technology and Industrial Development Forum, 2016). Therefore, scholars can actively
    carry out relevant research on blockchain. China is followed by the United States
    (16), Italy (9), the United Kingdom (7), India (7), France (5), Arabia (3), and
    South Korea (3). However, it should be noted that the average number of citations
    in the articles published in China is only 4.04, far lower than 15.75 in papers
    from the United States and 10.57 in papers from the United Kingdom. Table 4. Top

    blockchain technology to supply chains, researchers and practitioners have discussed
    three themes, impact, function and configuration, which are expanded in Wang et
    al. (2019). This study further subdivides these three themes into subthemes based
    on the characteristics of supply chain activities, which are shown in Table A1
    in Appendix A. The 106 articles are classified according to these themes. The
    first theme is “Impact”, with 36 articles, accounting for 34% of all the articles.
    Since research on blockchain-based supply chains has just started, it is necessary
    to define the impact of blockchain on supply chains to identify research opportunities.
    Most of these articles are still in the reasoning stage, meaning that conceptual
    means are used to explain the value, current status, challenges and opportunities
    of blockchain. For example, Queiroz and Wamba (2019) discussed the challenges
    of adopting blockchain in the supply chain through empirical research on the main
    driving forces in India and the United States. In their research, a model based
    on a slightly altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and
    use of technology was developed, and the results obtained revealed the existence
    of distinct adoption behaviours between India-based and USA-based professionals.
    For example, in response to the hypothesis that “social influence positively affects
    the behavioural intention to adopt blockchain”, India supports this view, while
    the United States stands on the opposite side. Under the theme “Impact”, 25 articles
    have no specific application area (categorized in the sub-theme “Ordinary”), and
    11 articles explore the impact of industry background including the agriculture
    (Antonucci et al., 2019, Chen et al., 2020, Duan et al., 2020, Feng et al., 2020,
    Kittipanya-ngam and Tan, 2020, Zhao et al., 2019) and service industries (Boulos
    et al., 2018, Chang et al., 2020, Choi et al., 2020, Juma et al., 2019, Yang,
    2019). More industries that have applied blockchain are discussed in Section 4.5.
    Most articles, 59.4%, focus on the second theme “Function”. This theme is related
    to addressing the following problem: “Where will blockchain penetrate the supply
    chain?” These articles focus on the specific changes caused by blockchain in terms
    of a certain aspect, which is a deeper study of the value of blockchain in terms
    of “Impact”. Through a review of 63 articles, it is found that blockchain has
    penetrated four aspects: product (35), process (11), operation (9), and sustainability
    (8). The sub-theme “Product” has attracted the most attention, in which most articles
    focus on “Traceability”. For example, Kamble et al. (2020) identified thirteen
    enablers of blockchain application in the agriculture supply chain based on a
    combined interpretive structural modelling and decision-making trial and evaluation
    laboratory methodology, and the findings from the study suggest that, among the
    identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason followed by
    auditability, immutability, and provenance. This phenomenon is consistent with
    the view that traceability is the greatest value of blockchain for supply chains.
    In contrast to the “Specific” theme with four subthemes, there are also many articles
    about “Information sharing” and the “Trust system”. In terms of the supply chain
    process, these articles discuss the impact of blockchain on design (Rahmanzadeh
    et al., 2020), order management (Martinez et al., 2019), produce (Leng et al.,
    2018, Mandolla et al., 2019), workflow (Chang et al., 2019, Perboli et al., 2018,
    Philipp et al., 2019) and logistics (Dolgui et al., 2020, Hasan et al., 2019,
    Tijan et al., 2019, Toennissen and Teuteberg, 2020). For example, Martinez et
    al. (2019) studied blockchain-driven customer order management and carried out
    simulations for three scenarios: current with no blockchain, 1-year and 5-year
    blockchain use. The results showed that blockchain improved the efficiency of
    the process: it reduced the number of operations, the average time of orders in
    the system and the workload, showed order traceability, and improved visibility
    to various supply chain participants. The level of operation directly affects
    the overall performance. The existing research studied operations from the viewpoint
    of partnerships (Kim & Shin, 2019), coordination (Li et al., 2019), performance
    (Hald & Kinra, 2019), platforms (Choi, 2019) and risk management (Choi et al.,
    2019, Fu and Zhu, 2019; L. Liu et al., 2019, Min, 2019, Zheng et al., 2020). The
    operation of the supply chain should focus on economic benefits and consider the
    environment and society, which collectively represent the well-known triple bottom
    line (TBL) principle. Saberi et al. (2019) proposed that blockchain technology
    may be a panacea for addressing the TBL, which is based on sustainability. To
    date, eight articles studied sustainability. Among them, two articles considered
    a single factor, environment (Kouhizadeh & Sarkis, 2018) and society (Venkatesh
    et al., 2020). Two factors were studied in three articles: environment and society
    (Castka et al., 2020), economy and society (Yadav & Singh, 2020), economy and
    environment (Manupati et al., 2020). Only three articles comprehensively considered
    all three factors (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020, Nayak and Dhaigude, 2019, Saberi
    et al., 2019). Therefore, the study of blockchain-based sustainable supply chains
    considering the three dimensions of economy, society and environment is still
    insufficient, and agendas for future studies are proposed in Section 5. Fewer
    studies, only 7, explore the theme “Configuration”. The articles focusing on this
    theme consider the simultaneous application of blockchain technology and emerging
    technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence
    (Bencic et al., 2019, Fernandez-Carames et al., 2019, Lezoche et al., 2020, Mazzei
    et al., 2020, Mondal et al., 2019, Rejeb et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2020). For
    example, Fernandez-Carames et al. (2019) designed a system in which blockchain
    and a distributed ledger are used to store the big data of a certain inventory
    collected by unmanned aerial vehicles. Different tests that were performed in
    a real industrial warehouse concluded that the system is able to rapidly obtain
    the inventory data compared with traditional manual tasks. Furthermore, the system
    is also capable of estimating item positions from a hovering vantage point that
    leverages their tag’s signal strength. 4.3. Research methodologies This section
    analyzes the research methodologies used to study blockchain-based supply chains.
    Four research method categories are identified through a review of 106 articles:
    conceptual, empirical, modelling and technical. Table A2 in Appendix A shows the
    106 articles grouped in the proposed four method categories, and it can be seen
    that the number of articles aligning with each of the four methodologies are not
    much different. This result illustrates that research opportunities still exist,
    as research in related fields is still in the exploration stage. There are 31
    articles, the largest number, falling into the “Conceptual” category, and this
    is consistent with the development of an emerging research field. A general description,
    literature reviews and theory are developed to address the proposed problem and
    are categorized in the “Conceptual” category, in which most studies were a general
    description. For example, Schmidt and Wagner (2019) utilized transaction cost
    theory to create a better understanding of how blockchain might influence supply
    chain relations, specifically in terms of transaction costs and governance decisions.
    The results revealed blockchain might significantly reduce transaction and governance
    costs of supply chain transactions, especially in reducing search and information
    cost. “Empirical” is the second largest research methodology category, with a
    total of 28 articles, including 19 qualitative articles and 9 quantitative articles.
    In qualitative research, different methods, such as seminars, implementation experience,
    expert interviews, and case studies are adopted to gain research insights. For
    example, van Hoek (2019b) explored lessons learned by early adopters of blockchain
    technology in the supply chain through three case studies from different industries
    (logistics services, consumer products and retail), supply chain positions (manufacturer,
    carrier, and retailer) and geographies (Europe and USA). Based on the insights
    from the case studies, lessons learned include the value in scoping pilots in
    a targeted manner, including the use of existing technology in the pilot, and
    the ability to rapidly when provided with executive and stakeholder engagement.
    In addition to the qualitative analysis mentioned above, some studies carried
    out “Empirical” quantitative research, which refers to developing and testing
    hypotheses, collecting data, and verifying hypotheses. For example, Wong et al.
    (2020) discussed the impact of top management support, cost, market dynamics,
    competitive pressure, and regulatory support on supply chain management based
    on empirical data from 194 small-medium enterprises in Malaysia. The results showed
    competitive pressure, complexity, cost and regulatory support have significant
    effects on behavioural intention. In contrast, market dynamics, regulatory support
    and upper management support were insignificant predictors. A total of 22.6% of
    the articles used modelling methods to solve research problems. More specifically,
    12.3% of the articles adopted mathematical modelling, which consists of nonlinear
    programming, game theory and mean–variance approaches. These approaches attempt
    to solve problems through the results of mathematical operations. For example,
    Manupati et al. (2020) studied the use of blockchain for production allocation
    problems in a multi-echelon supply chain, and the results showed that the blockchain
    approach minimizes both total cost and carbon emissions. Furthermore, 6 articles
    used simulation modelling, and the purpose of this method is to imitate the implementation
    of blockchain. For example, Leng et al. (2018) designed an agricultural supply
    chain system based on blockchain technology, and the results illustrated that
    the proposed system improved the openness and security of transaction information.
    In addition, 5 articles applied multicriteria decision modelling methodologies,
    including fuzzy decision making (FDM) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP).
    The barriers (Ozturk & Yildizbasi, 2020), evaluation and selection criteria (Bai
    & Sarkis, 2020) and success factors (S. S. Kamble et al., 2020, Nayak and Dhaigude,
    2019, Yadav and Singh, 2020) were determined using the multicriteria decision
    method. The smallest number of articles, 23, focused on system implementation,
    and current research focuses on the framework (52.2%) and system (47.8%). This
    series of articles attempted to determine how to deploy blockchain in supply chains.
    Technical and business solutions were provided in the “Technical” articles. Some
    scholars proposed technical frameworks, for example, Wu et al. (2017) introduced
    a delivery framework composed of a set of private distributed ledgers and a blockchain
    public ledger. Studies also focused on the implementation of a system. Helo and
    Hao (2019) established a blockchain-based logistics monitoring system that was
    designed and tested based on Ethereum. In general, most systems were implemented
    through Ethereum (Fernandez-Carames et al., 2019, Hasan et al., 2019, Helo and
    Hao, 2019, Toyoda et al., 2017, Yoo and Won, 2018) and Hyperledger Fabric (Cui
    et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020). 4.4. Illustration types
    This study designed three illustration types to narrow the various gaps in the
    research methodologies discussed in Section 4.3 and to identify the theoretical
    gaps and empirical opinions of different authors. Three categories were developed,
    “Application”, “Theoretical approach” and “Numerical examples”, as shown in Table
    A3 of Appendix A. This table shows that 38 articles, the largest number, study
    and verify the proposed theories by analysing case studies or applications of
    blockchain, which is consistent with the view that industry leads academia in
    the study of practical technology. For example, Kshetri (2018) discussed case
    studies of blockchain projects at various stages of development for different
    purposes to analyze how it affects key supply chain management objectives. The
    results showed that blockchain affects cost, quality, speed, reliability, risk
    reduction, sustainability and flexibility. Thirty-five articles (33%) used a “theoretical
    approach”; these studies discussed the theoretical gap by using some methodologies
    or empirical approaches. Only qualitative empirical approaches fall under this
    theme. The quantitative empirical approaches are classified as “Numerical examples”
    due to the use of empirical data. For example, the study of Wang et al. (2019)
    falls into the “theoretical approach” category because these scholars determine
    how blockchain technology has transformed the supply chain through in-depth interviews
    with 14 supply chain experts. However, Yang (2019) studied the driving factors
    of the successful application of blockchain in a maritime supply chain through
    empirical data from top management, members of boards of directors and planning
    staff. Hence, their research is classified into the “Numerical example” category.
    Thirty-three articles used “Numerical examples” to prove the effectiveness of
    the developed methods; this is regarded as an appropriate approach for verifying
    the theories of the study, but it should also be noted that the limitations of
    this approach cannot be fully fitted unless it is applied in practical applications.
    Longo et al. (2019) simulated the operation process of a blockchain-based supply
    chain to quantitatively evaluate the benefits that companies can obtain under
    this context, and the results showed that blockchain technology is a convenient
    tool for supply chain collaboration, trust and overall performance. More discussions
    about the theory and practice are provided in Section 5.3. 4.5. Industries addressed
    Research on the combination of blockchain and supply chains focuses on different
    industrial sectors. The review articles are classified into primary, secondary
    and tertiary industries according to the North American Industry Classification
    System (Wang et al., 2019). Primary industries refer to agriculture, forestry,
    fishing, and animal husbandry, and secondary industries include manufacturing,
    light industry, construction, mining and so on. Trade, logistics, transportation,
    retail, etc., are all tertiary industries. Table A4 in Appendix A shows that 36
    out of 106 articles did not focus on a specific industry application, which is
    indicated under the category “None”. These studies tried to explain common problems,
    which is the current research focus. In the articles focusing on a specific industry,
    the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries accounted for 21.7%, 18, 9%, and
    17.9%, respectively. Most research mainly focused on primary industries, and agriculture
    has attracted the most attention, with studies on pork (George et al., 2019, Sander
    et al., 2018), soybeans (Salah et al., 2019), wine (Bencic et al., 2019), fresh
    food (Perboli et al., 2018), eggs (Bumblauskas et al., 2020), cereals (Zhang et
    al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020) and so on. The agricultural field attracted the
    most attention. There are two reasons to show that the concern for the agricultural
    field is reasonable. The first reason is that consumers need detailed product
    information from the farm to the table, and blockchain technology improves the
    traceability of agricultural products (Feng et al., 2020). At the same time, blockchain
    technology can realize real-time temperature monitoring for fresh foods with strict
    temperature requirements such as eggs and pork, during circulation (Leng et al.,
    2018). The second reason is due to concerns about food safety. Blockchain technology
    can quickly and accurately locate problematic products to improve the recall rate
    of food and be used to build a complete recall system to respond to public health
    emergencies (Zhao et al., 2019). The second largest group of articles focuses
    on three types of secondary industries: manufacturing (Ko et al., 2018, Mandolla
    et al., 2019, Xu et al., 2019), light industry (Sylim et al., 2018, Tseng et al.,
    2018, Yong et al., 2020), and construction (Wang et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2019).
    For example, Mandolla et al. (2019) focus on the phases characterizing the metal
    additive manufacturing process for producing components for the aircraft industry
    and propose a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry
    through the exploitation of blockchain solutions, ultimately providing a conceptual
    answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive
    manufacturing process in the aircraft industry. Most of the research focused on
    manufacturing because the bullwhip effect arises if an upstream enterprise cannot
    obtain the demand of the downstream enterprise in a timely and accurate manner.
    Blockchain technology improves information incompleteness and asymmetry in the
    manufacturing process and can be used to achieve real-time information sharing
    (Fu & Zhu, 2019). Finally, the third group of articles studied the field of tertiary
    industry, which consists of trading (Allen et al., 2019), transportation (Yanovich
    et al., 2018), retail (Choi & Luo, 2019) and health (Boulos et al., 2018). The
    application of blockchain technology in the trade field can bring some benefits,
    such as reducing intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency (Liu
    & Li, 2020). In addition to the specific industry sector, some scholars have also
    conducted research in multiple industrial sectors (meaning an article contains
    two or more application scenarios), which are shown under the category “Multi-industry”
    (Astarita et al., 2020, Azzi et al., 2019, Chang et al., 2020, Gurtu and Johny,
    2019, Karamchandani et al., 2020, Toennissen and Teuteberg, 2020, van Hoek, 2020,
    Wamba and Queiroz, 2020), which makes the conclusions more universal and applicable
    to providing industry insights. For example, Toennissen and Teuteberg (2020) investigated
    ten blockchain-based industries, including ocean freight, agri-food, animal products,
    etc., and the results showed that there is no disintermediation. Chang et al.
    (2020) summarized the key challenges for blockchain implementation through the
    analysis of blockchain applications in the maritime industry, transportation industry,
    food, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing supply chains. 5. Future opportunities
    in the field of blockchain-based supply chain The findings and discussions in
    Section 4 help to determine the research gaps and identify future research opportunities.
    Based on 4.2 Supply chain themes, 4.3 Research methodologies, 4.4 Illustration
    types, 4.5 Industries addressed, research gaps and opportunities are found in
    terms of the following four directions: (1) ignored themes in supply chains, (2)
    applied methodologies in the research, (3) academic theory and industrial practice
    and (4) practice in different industrial sectors. 5.1. Ignored themes in supply
    chains The research of configuration receives less attention in comparison with
    the themes of impact and function. This situation may be due to the following
    three reasons (Duan et al., 2020). The first is described as the amount of data
    increases exponentially with the widespread use of the the Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices, which brings great difficulties to data storage. The second is
    the delay in the transmission process. The consistency of the entire blockchain
    network is ensured through delay, but the delay is unacceptable for many IoT-based
    applications. The third is the security issue; the blockchain network security
    and the privacy of the participants are both worthy of attention due to the vulnerability
    of the IoT. Zhang et al. (2020) proposed that the integration of blockchain and
    IoT, artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning and other emerging technologies
    can achieve excellent operation of the supply chain. Therefore, carrying out related
    research in this field, especially regarding data storage, information transmission,
    and blockchain network security, is a promising avenue. The discussion on sustainability
    seems to be limited compared with other subthemes. The following limitations are
    discovered by analysing eight articles related to the theme of sustainability:
    (1) Social dimension attention is insufficient. Social-level standards should
    all be considered in the sustainable supply chain, including working conditions,
    work health and safety, human rights and product safety. However, product safety
    is the focus of most articles, and only one article considers other dimensions
    in addition to product safety (Venkatesh et al., 2020). Therefore, relevant research
    is needed to improve the indicators of the social dimension in the blockchain-based
    supply chain. (2) Environmental concern is not comprehensive. The environmental
    issues considered in supply chains should include waste management, energy efficiency,
    greenhouse gas emissions and so on. Most of the current research focuses on the
    discussion of “Green”, that is, reducing carbon emissions (Manupati et al., 2020).
    A few articles mention waste management (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018, Saberi et
    al., 2019), and there is no relevant research on energy efficiency. Therefore,
    more comprehensive environmental issues need to be studied to better emphasize
    the role of blockchain in promoting environmental management. (3) Lack of quantitative
    research. Since conceptual methods were used in most articles, the quantitative
    studies are deemed inadequate. At present, there is no research that can systematically
    propose a sustainable supply chain performance model under the blockchain environment.
    More research should be carried out under the theme of coordination, performance
    and order management. From Table A1, it can be seen that the top five specific
    articles are traceability (20), information sharing (9), economy, society and
    environment (8), trust system (6), and risk (5). This phenomenon is consistent
    with the value of the blockchain for supply chains analyzed in Section 2. The
    other topics listed in Table A1 have not received much attention, such as coordination,
    performance and order management, which are crucial for supply chains management
    (Hald and Kinra, 2019, Li et al., 2019, Martinez et al., 2019). Therefore, the
    research related to these topics should also be conducted to meet the challenges
    of blockchain-based supply chains. 5.2. Applied methodologies in the research
    Four methodologies are developed to carry out the research, including conceptual,
    empirical, modelling and technical. This section explores the research opportunities
    from the above four methodologies. First, literature reviews have gradually become
    the focus of research under the conceptual category with the increase in the number
    of related studies. However, the existing literature review can be divided into
    two categories: research in which there is no specific industry background focus,
    and research that has an agricultural background focus. Hence, there is a lack
    of literature reviews about the application of blockchain in manufacturing, trade
    and other specific fields. Second, current research uses empirical qualitative
    methods. As this research deepens, case studies and quantitative research should
    occupy a dominant position to guide the configuration of blockchain in supply
    chains. Since blockchain technology is in the early stages of development, conceptual
    and empirical methodologies can be used to strengthen the relationship between
    blockchain and supply chains and propose related theories. As the research continues,
    it is necessary to use modelling methods to verify newly developed theories. Currently,
    there are many research opportunities in mathematical modelling, simulation modelling
    and multicriteria decisions, which fall in the modelling category. There is a
    lack of studies using mathematical modelling for the direct application of blockchain.
    At present, research content focuses on the blockchain environment and determining
    the factors affected by blockchain as well as their impact on the results. For
    example, Ko et al. (2018) compared the impact of blockchain technology on the
    profits of manufacturing companies, and the results showed that blockchain technology
    improves the profitability and competitiveness of manufacturing firms. Choi et
    al. (2019) discussed aviation logistics risks in the era of blockchain, focusing
    on “air-logistics related operations”, “demand management”, “supply management”,
    and “supply–demand coordination”. Therefore, research using mathematical modelling
    to analyze blockchain technology is urgently needed to address this research gap.
    The articles using simulation modelling connect theory and practice and narrow
    the gap between them. There are six articles in the category for this theme, but
    only one article simulates the entire supply chain operation (Longo et al., 2019).
    Therefore, future simulation research should consider goods, information, capital
    flow, organization, production, and delivery processes (purchasing, inventory
    management, logistics management, etc.) with suppliers, wholesalers, retailers,
    and carriers. Five articles use multicriteria decision-making models to determine
    the successful factors of implementation (Kamble et al., 2020, Nayak and Dhaigude,
    2019, Yadav and Singh, 2020), obstacles to implementation (Ozturk & Yildizbasi,
    2020) and blockchain selection and evaluation (Bai & Sarkis, 2020). There are
    gaps in some of the studies determining the factors of and obstacles to successful
    implementation, so the general conclusion needs to be applied to blockchain practice.
    It is also necessary to establish a connection between these factors through mathematical
    modelling or simulation modelling and identify new research gaps. Finally, research
    on technology should be strengthened. The review of the technology studies indicates
    that the following two aspects are not well studied. First, each company currently
    has its own management system, so studies should pay more attention to existing
    systems that can be integrated with blockchain technology. Second, many enterprises
    have developed their own unique blockchain platforms. If an enterprise participates
    in multiple groups, it needs to use multiple platforms, which will increase the
    burden of the participants and consume too many resources. Therefore, unified
    technical standards are needed to ensure system compatibility. 5.3. Academic theory
    and industrial practice Theoretical gaps and empirical claims are verified in
    three types of articles, namely, those that fall into the application, theoretical
    approach and numerical examples categories, as shown in Table A3. Thirty-eight
    articles validated their theories through “Applications”. This method is generally
    accepted by the related research community, and the research results provide opinions
    for current academic and practical research. To better explore the relationship
    between academic theory and industrial practice, scholars should consider the
    following research opportunities. Blockchain technology has not attracted the
    attention of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Through the analysis of
    13 case studies in the “Application” category, it is found that most cases are
    concerned with the implementation of blockchain projects of some large enterprises,
    such as Wal-Mart, IBM and Maersk, and only two of them focus on SMEs (Chang et
    al., 2020, Perboli et al., 2018). It is normal for this phenomenon to occur, and
    the development of SMEs is lagging behind that of large enterprises in emerging
    technologies due to the difference in cognitive level and infrastructure. However,
    blockchain technology can solve current dilemmas of SMEs, including limited resources
    and the difficulty in finding investors and expanding the business scale. Therefore,
    blockchain technology presents both opportunities and challenges for SMEs. At
    the same time, SMEs should also recognize their own advantages. Having a concise
    organizational structure makes the deployment of blockchain easier and the initial
    cost lower. As noted above, relevant research on SMEs is in-depth. Since research
    on SMEs has just started, there are many topics that can be considered: (1) What
    value does blockchain technology have for SMEs, and how does this value differ
    from that for large enterprises? (2) What are the obstacles to successful blockchain
    implementation in SMEs? What are the similarities and differences concerning those
    found in large enterprises? The voices of different groups should be investigated
    when academic research is conducted. There are 35 articles using the “Theoretical
    approach” method, so a question arises: Can theory be used to guide practice?
    Pagell and Shevchenko (2014) claimed that academic research involving practice
    managers can better guide practical activities. Therefore, some research involves
    the intersection of theoretical methods and numerical experiments due to the use
    of statistics. To carry out research on industrial practice, seminars, questionnaire
    surveys and expert interviews are designed to obtain data. The interviewees are
    supply chain experts (Hackius and Petersen, 2020, Kim and Shin, 2019, Philipp
    et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019), supply chain industry managers
    (Dubey et al., 2020, Sander et al., 2018, van Hoek, 2019a, van Hoek, 2019b), and
    supply chain practitioners (Behnke and Janssen, 2020, Kamble et al., 2019, Karamchandani
    et al., 2020, Queiroz and Wamba, 2019, Sheel and Nath, 2019, van Hoek, 2020, Wong
    et al., 2020, Yang, 2019), with different perspectives from academia and industry.
    Future research needs to include other groups, such as individuals representing
    the government, different industries, and different countries, to obtain a more
    general view. The articles using numerical experiments operate somewhere in the
    middle of “theoretical method” and “real-world application”, which connects theory
    and practice. The sustainability theme deserves more attention. In the numerical
    example category, there are 12 articles that considered cost or profit when the
    objective function was established (Choi, 2019, Choi et al., 2020, Feng et al.,
    2020, Choi and Luo, 2019, Choi et al., 2019, Hayrutdinov et al., 2020, Ko et al.,
    2018, Li et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019, Longo et al., 2019, Manupati et al.,
    2020, Rahmanzadeh et al., 2020, Zheng et al., 2020); these two aspects have attracted
    great attention and will be the focus of future research. However, only one of
    these articles in the sustainability theme category considered environmental factors
    (Manupati et al., 2020), which means that relevant research on theory and practice
    of the sustainability theme is insufficient. 5.4. Practice in different industrial
    sectors Tertiary industry presents prospects for the future of blockchain-based
    supply chains. According to the survey results presented in Table A4, research
    on blockchain-based supply chains considers primary, secondary and tertiary industries,
    indicating that blockchain has good applicability in all industries. In addition,
    the proportion of studies on various industries is not very different. This result
    indicates that there are still research opportunities for studying blockchain
    technology in various industries. However, in recent decades, the economy has
    developed rapidly and there is a great focus on tertiary industries rather than
    secondary industries. Therefore, more relevant research will be carried out in
    tertiary industries to determine the value of blockchain. More industrial sectors
    should be studied. In terms of the industries subcategory, the agriculture, manufacturing,
    and trade sectors have received the most attention. That is, the shareability,
    security, and smart capabilities of blockchain technology are helpful for solving
    problems in these industry sectors. There are few studies focusing on forests
    and fisheries (Figorilli et al., 2018, Howson, 2020), and some industries have
    also been overlooked, such as animal husbandry in the primary industry, mining
    and energy in the secondary industry, and cultural entertainment in the tertiary
    industry. These industries also represent future research opportunities. 6. Conclusions
    This study included a review of existing research on blockchain technology in
    supply chains. Overall, 106 publications were identified through an article theme
    search, type screening and content screening. Then, through descriptive analysis
    and content analysis, five themes were identified in the 106 publications, including
    (1) publications per year, main journals and countries, (2) supply chain themes,
    (3) research methodologies, (4) illustration types and (5) industries addressed.
    The results and findings of this study prove that research on blockchain-based
    supply chains is an emerging field that is receiving strong attention. Specific
    findings and discussions are addressed in Section 4, and future research opportunities
    are presented in Section 5; these are identified based on the discussion in Section
    4 and our academic experience. To our knowledge, this study is the first literature
    review that considers the supply chain themes, research methodologies, illustration
    types and industries addressed. This review of research of blockchain-based supply
    chains is timely because it provides a solid foundation for related studies. The
    contribution of this research is twofold. For academia, this study explains the
    value of blockchain technology for supply chains, and insights for future agendas
    are provided for scholars. In terms of industry and individuals focused on practice,
    this study helps managers worry less about applying blockchain and implementing
    blockchain plans. Finally, although a detailed search was conducted, we acknowledge
    that some related articles were missed. This study considered only peer-reviewed
    journal papers; conference papers, books, newspapers, reviews and other documents
    are not included. Therefore, a literature review that overcomes the above limitations
    should be conducted in the future. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ming

    Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising technology with far-reaching\n\
    implications for the food industry. The combination of immutability, enhanced\
    \ visibility, transparency\nand data integrity provides numerous beneﬁts that\
    \ improve trust in extended food supply chains\n(FSCs). Blockchain can enhance\
    \ traceability, enable more eﬃcient recall and aids in risk reduction\nof counterfeits\
    \ and other forms of illicit trade. Moreover, blockchain can enhance the integrity\
    \ of\ncredence claims such as sustainably sourced, organic or faith-based claims\
    \ such as kosher or halal by\nintegrating the authoritative source of the claim\
    \ (e.g., the certiﬁcation body or certiﬁcation owner)\ninto the blockchain to\

    Despite the promises and market hype, a comprehensive overview of the potential\
    \ beneﬁts and\nchallenges of blockchain in FSCs is still missing. To bridge this\
    \ knowledge gap, we present the\nﬁndings from a systematic review and bibliometric\
    \ analysis of sixty-one (61) journal articles and\nsynthesize existing research.\
    \ The main beneﬁts of blockchain technology in FCSs are improved food\ntraceability,\
    \ enhanced collaboration, operational eﬃciencies and streamlined food trading\
    \ processes.\nPotential challenges include technical, organizational and regulatory\
    \ issues. We discuss the theoretical\nand practical implications of our research\
    \ and present several ideas for future research.\nKeywords: blockchain technology;\

    \ analysis\n1. Introduction\nThe globalization of food supply chains (FSCs) and\
    \ markets has led to a signiﬁcant increase\nin products and information movements\
    \ between countries [1]. Traditional FSCs are characterized\nby strong vertical\
    \ integration and coordination among supply chain partners to promote eﬃciency,\n\
    for example, by lowering transaction, operating and marketing costs and fulﬁlling\
    \ consumer needs\nfor food quality and safety [2]. Therefore, FSC exchange partners\
    \ have found themselves under\nincreasing pressure to improve the transparency\
    \ of their supply chains, enhance the exchange of trusted\nLogistics 2020, 4,\
    \ 0027; doi:10.3390/logistics4040027\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/logistics\nLogistics\
    \ 2020, 4, 0027\n2 of 26\ninformation, and improve the tracking and tracing capability\
    \ (henceforth traceability) of agricultural\nproducts from farms through to retailers\
    \ [3–5].\nAdditionally, the traceability of food products and overall supply chain\
    \ transparency has become\ncritical due to multiple scandals occurring in global\
    \ FSCs (e.g., the horsemeat scandal in Europe,\nthe melamine scandal in China).\
    \ The need for eﬀective traceability has intensiﬁed as regulations\nrequire that\
    \ every ingredient of a food product is traceable to its source [6]. Consumer\
    \ demand has led\nto the year-round availability of many agricultural products\
    \ and intensiﬁed the pressure on businesses\nto provide details on product-speciﬁc\
    \ attributes such as quality, safety, authenticity, traceability,\nprovenance\
    \ (food provenance is the geographic source or origin as determined by analytical\
    \ science,\nand diﬀers from data provenance) and conditions of production and\
    \ supply [7,8]. The heightened\ndemand for information is a driving factor for\
    \ the introduction of new technologies. For example,\nradio-frequency identiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) technology has been deployed in FSCs to aid visibility and\ntraceability\
    \ [9], reduce food waste [10], facilitate forward tracking [11–13], increase operational\n\
    eﬃciencies [14–16], automate data collection, prevent errors in order picking\
    \ and shipping [17] and\nintelligently control conditions (e.g., temperature,\
    \ humidity) and supply chain processes [18–20].\nCloud computing platforms are\
    \ used for storing information related to food products, and this\ninformation\
    \ is made accessible to retailers and consumers through websites or barcode scans\
    \ using\na mobile device [21]. Srivastava and Wood [22] note that cloud computing\
    \ enables short messaging\nservices in agricultural supply chains, providing information\
    \ about weather conditions, proper use of\npesticides, alerts of disease outbreaks\
    \ and government subsidies. While these platforms drive FSCs\ntoward a digital\
    \ and data-driven food ecosystem, several fundamental problems remain unaddressed.\n\
    For instance, there is a lack of continuous monitoring of the FSC and an inability\
    \ to predict the remaining\nshelf life of fresh produce [23]. Similarly, the conventional\
    \ food supervision system suﬀers from data\nfragmentation, a lack of transparency\
    \ caused by data discrepancies and inconsistencies, insuﬃcient\ninteroperability\
    \ and lack of information traceability [24]. To address these problems, FSC scholars\
    \ and\npractitioners envision the application of blockchain technology in the\
    \ food industry to revolutionize\nthe way FSCs are designed, developed, organized,\
    \ and managed. According to Wang et al. [25],\nblockchain can potentially impact\
    \ future supply chain practices and policies by providing extended\nvisibility\
    \ and traceability. Likewise, it has the potential to improve traditional supply\
    \ chain processes\nthat are characterized by a dominating actor serving as a central\
    \ third-party provider imposing their\nown rules, governance mechanism and centralized\
    \ architectures [26].\nBlockchain is deﬁned as “a digital, decentralized and distributed\
    \ ledger in which transactions\nare logged and added in chronological order with\
    \ the goal of creating permanent and tamperproof\nrecords” [27] (p. 574). Rejeb\
    \ et al. [28] argue that blockchain is a combination of multiple technologies,\n\
    tools, and methods to address a particular problem or business case. Aside from\
    \ being a driving\nforce behind cryptocurrencies, blockchain has gained widespread\
    \ popularity in the supply chain\nand logistics community because of its ability\
    \ to increase transparency, ensure the immutability of\ntransactions and enhance\
    \ trust among participating food stakeholders [29,30]. Since research on\nthe\
    \ integration of blockchain technology into the FSC has only recently started\
    \ to emerge, there is\na considerable demand for investigating its potentials\
    \ for FSCs. The intricate complexity of FSCs\nbrings about new health and safety\
    \ challenges to which food stakeholders need to react by ensuring\nsustainable\
    \ food ecosystems. For example, Dubai uses blockchain and other Internet-based\
    \ technology\nto enhance food safety and provide consumers’ with nutritional information\
    \ through its “Food Watch”\ninitiative—a technology platform that digitizes information\
    \ and digitalizes food safety processes and\nroles as well as providing nutritional\
    \ information of all edible items served through the 20,000 or more\nfood establishments\
    \ [31].\nAdditionally, Walmart, IBM, and Tsinghua University explored the use\
    \ of blockchain to improve\nfood safety across China and enhance the traceability\
    \ of food items along the supply chain [32]. Similarly,\nChinese retailer Jindong\
    \ has partnered with Kerchin, an Inner Mongolia-based beef producer, to apply\n\
    blockchain technology in compiling digital product information such as farm details,\
    \ batch numbers,\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n3 of 26\nfactory and processing data,\
    \ expiration dates, storage temperatures and shipping details that are\ndigitally\
    \ connected to trace every step of in the processing of the food items. Their\
    \ system enables\ncustomers to trace information about frozen meat, such as a\
    \ cow’s breed, weight and diet, and the\nlocation of farms by scanning the QR\
    \ code available on the packaging [33]. On a larger scale, according to\nEdwards\
    \ [34], Alibaba has launched an initiative to collaborate with Blackmores and\
    \ several other\nAustralian and New Zealand-based food producers and suppliers\
    \ to prevent the rise of counterfeit\nfood items sold across China through the\
    \ application of blockchain. Slovenia-based Origin Trail,\na not-for-proﬁt technology\
    \ developer, created an open-source data protocol (or middleware) based\non the\
    \ GS1 supply chain standards that act as a standards-based interoperability platform\
    \ between\nblockchains and legacy systems [35]. Origin Trail has partnered with\
    \ the British Standards Institute\n(BSI) to advance blockchain use cases, especially\
    \ in the food industry [36]. On a global scale, and due\nprimarily to the multitude\
    \ of use cases, no comprehensive roadmap exists to streamline blockchain\nimplementations\
    \ and adoption of blockchain-based platforms across FSCs is lagging expectations\
    \ [37].\nTo shed light on the potentials and challenges of blockchain in the FSC,\
    \ in this study, we review\nthe state-of-the-art of the technology, its recent\
    \ developments, and the applications in the food industry.\nMoving beyond the\
    \ discussion of whether FSC stakeholders should adopt blockchain technology,\n\
    we investigate the opportunities resulting from blockchain technology applications\
    \ already adopted in\nFSCs. More speciﬁcally, we seek answers to the following\
    \ research question: What are the potentials and\nchallenges of blockchain adoption\
    \ in the FSC?\nMore speciﬁcally, the literature review presented in this paper\n\
    (1)\nprovides a background of blockchain technology to allow researchers from\
    \ diﬀerent ﬁelds to\nposition their research activities appropriately,\n(2)\n\
    summarizes existing research and developments concerning the implementation of\
    \ blockchain\ntechnology toward sustainable FSCs by outlining the potentials and\
    \ challenges and\n(3)\nidentiﬁes gaps in current research that highlights areas\
    \ for further investigation.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the methods applied in\nthis research for literature collection\
    \ and selection in Section 3. Section 4 provides a detailed discussion\nof the\
    \ ﬁndings of this review, and in Section 5, we answer the research questions of\
    \ this study. Finally,\nwe conclude the paper, highlight the theoretical and managerial\
    \ contributions and outline the study\nlimitations and future research directions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology\nWe conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to\
    \ identify, evaluate and interpret research and\ndevelopments relevant to the\
    \ application of blockchain technology in the FSC. An SLR is a rigorous\nand replicable\
    \ method [38] to assess and analyze previously published work relevant to a particular\n\
    research question, research topic or other matter of interest [39]. The systematic\
    \ process of literature\ncollection and analysis is useful for extracting pertinent\
    \ insights based on the ﬁndings of previous\nresearch and identifying possible\
    \ knowledge gaps [40]. We precisely followed the guidelines of\nTranﬁed et al.\
    \ [40] and Aguinis et al. [41] for traditional qualitative reviews and supplemented\
    \ our\nreview with a co-citation network analysis. This method has three stages,\
    \ namely (1) planning the\nreview, (2) conducting the review and (3) reporting\
    \ the review. The following subsections elaborate on\neach of these stages.\n\
    2.1. Planning the Review\nTwo methodical approaches were employed to answer our\
    \ research question. At the initial stage,\nand in line with the goals of this\
    \ project, we decided to employ a qualitative method to obtain a deeper\nunderstanding\
    \ of the core issues regarding blockchain technology and FSC research. Then, we\
    \ decided\nto carefully examine several knowledge domains of blockchain and FSC\
    \ research by conducting a\nco-citation network analysis to reveal diﬀerent domains,\
    \ pending issues and future research directions.\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n4 of\

    \ from various disciplines or ﬁelds studying\nblockchain technology in the context\
    \ of the FSC. Scopus is more comprehensive than the Web of\nScience (WoS), containing\
    \ 84% of the WoS titles [42] and oﬀering greater coverage of open access\njournals\
    \ [43] including those indexed in DOAJ and other leading databases, such as IEEE\
    \ Explorer,\nSpringer, ScienceDirect and Taylor and Francis. According to Tober\
    \ [44], Scopus is considered the most\npowerful search engine to get an overview\
    \ of a particular topic. In terms of volume, Scopus contains\nmore than 20,000\
    \ peer-reviewed journals from 5000 publishers and 1200 open access journals [45].\n\
    To collect and extract relevant articles, we initially created a pool of keywords\

    \ in “article title, abstract and keywords.” For transparency and clarity, the\
    \ advanced search function\nused in Scopus is shown in Appendix A.\nThe scope\
    \ of data collection was identiﬁed using several attributes, such as discipline,\
    \ language,\nthe period of publication, and document type [41]. In terms of disciplines,\
    \ we restricted our search to\nbusiness, computer science, engineering, decision\
    \ sciences, social sciences, agriculture, environment,\nand economics. We only\
    \ selected articles written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\
    In doing so, we ensured that the reviewed literature originated from rigorous\
    \ academic sources [46]\nand maintained a high quality of the retrieved publications.\
    \ The publications were then scrutinized\nand treated independently and coded\

    \ FSC and provide readers with an overview of current \nblockchain and FSC research.\
    \ Using a scientometric analysis allows us to visualize knowledge in a \nway that\

    \ It is a powerful tool to analyze many types of bibliometric networks, ranging\
    \ from \ncitation networks between documents and co-authorship networks between\
    \ scholars to keyword co-\noccurrences [77]. In our study, network nodes represent\
    \ either a keyword or an article. The color of \nthe node reflects a particular\
    \ property, and its radius indicates the frequency of a keyword or how \noften\
    \ a document is cited. \n3.4.1. Keyword Co-Occurrence  \nThe analysis of keyword\
    \ co-occurrence helps to identify the primary topics discussed in a \nparticular\
    \ research area by visualizing similarities among frequently co-occurring keywords\
    \ or topics \nin the literature ([78]. The co-occurrence describes the number\
    \ of times two words appear together \nin the title, abstract or list of keywords\
    \ [79]. Applying this bibliometric technique, researchers can get \na broad picture\
    \ regarding the content of a paper, including its methods, objectives, and viewpoints.\
    \ \nThus, the analysis of keyword co-occurrence is critical to examine current\
    \ topics and developments \nassociated with blockchain technology applications\
    \ in the FSC. The original data were prepared, and \nsimilar keywords, such as\
    \ “blockchain” and “blockchain technology,” were merged to generate the \nkeyword\
    \ co-occurrence network. After fixing the threshold of keyword co-occurrence at\
    \ a minimum \nof two, the visualization of content results in 35 nodes with different\
    \ colors, as shown in Figure 4. \nEach node in the figure represents a keyword,\
    \ and the radius of the node corresponds to its frequency \nin the literature.\
    \ Keywords that co-occur frequently tend to be located next to each other in the\

    \ from citation networks between documents and\nco-authorship networks between\
    \ scholars to keyword co-occurrences [77]. In our study, network nodes\nrepresent\
    \ either a keyword or an article. The color of the node reﬂects a particular property,\
    \ and its\nradius indicates the frequency of a keyword or how often a document\
    \ is cited.\n3.4.1. Keyword Co-Occurrence\nThe analysis of keyword co-occurrence\
    \ helps to identify the primary topics discussed in a particular\nresearch area\
    \ by visualizing similarities among frequently co-occurring keywords or topics\
    \ in the\nliterature ([78]. The co-occurrence describes the number of times two\
    \ words appear together in the\ntitle, abstract or list of keywords [79]. Applying\
    \ this bibliometric technique, researchers can get a broad\npicture regarding\
    \ the content of a paper, including its methods, objectives, and viewpoints. Thus,\n\
    the analysis of keyword co-occurrence is critical to examine current topics and\
    \ developments associated\nwith blockchain technology applications in the FSC.\
    \ The original data were prepared, and similar\nkeywords, such as “blockchain”\
    \ and “blockchain technology,” were merged to generate the keyword\nco-occurrence\
    \ network. After ﬁxing the threshold of keyword co-occurrence at a minimum of\
    \ two,\nthe visualization of content results in 35 nodes with diﬀerent colors,\
    \ as shown in Figure 4. Each node in\nthe ﬁgure represents a keyword, and the\
    \ radius of the node corresponds to its frequency in the literature.\nKeywords\
    \ that co-occur frequently tend to be located next to each other in the network.\
    \ As shown in\nFigure 4, the keywords were grouped into four main clusters with\
    \ a diﬀerent level of signiﬁcance.\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n7 of 26\nLogistics\

    \ unlocks several potentials in the FSC because \nthey help automate business\
    \ processes and initiate transactions among FSC entities, resulting in \nbetter\
    \ coordination and optimization of the entire FSC [30,82,83]. Finally, the yellow\
    \ cluster includes \nkeywords such as “smart farming”, “precision agriculture”,\

    \ Technology in the FSC\n4.1.1. Food Traceability\nAccording to Bosona and Gebresenbet\
    \ [130], food traceability is part of logistics management.\nIt deals with the\
    \ capture, storage, and transmission of information about food products throughout\
    \ the\nstages of the FSC in order to facilitate the control of food quality and\
    \ safety and ensure the backward\ntracing and forward tracking of the food. Traceability\
    \ is increasingly regarded as a vital aspect of\nproviding safe and wholesome\
    \ food [131–133] and the assurance of consumer satisfaction and trust.\nThe need\
    \ for food traceability is clearly emphasized among consumers, particularly after\
    \ consecutive\nscandals around the world [134,135], such as the melamine crisis\
    \ in China, the European horsemeat\nscandal [136], and the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy\
    \ (BSC) crisis [137]. As a result, stronger\nregulations demand the introduction\
    \ of food traceability systems and represents an opportunity for\nFSC exchange\
    \ partners to share essential data and information about food products [130,138–144].\n\
    Food traceability beneﬁts consumers, the food industry, retailers and regulators\
    \ alike [145]. Moreover,\nblockchain technology can provide supply chain traceability\
    \ and information transparency and enable\nthe rapid identiﬁcation of the history,\
    \ movement, and current location of consumer products (or a lot or\nbatch) with\
    \ food safety issues [3]. FSC trading partners will be able to maintain a transaction\
    \ recording\nsystem that can be used to aid the integrity of food products as\
    \ they move along the supply chain,\nhelping to increase control over all transactions\
    \ and interactions between food suppliers, producers,\nlogistics providers and\
    \ customers [112].\nBlockchain technology can add substantial value to food businesses\
    \ as traceability of end products\nis feasible at every point in the FSC, with\
    \ the ability to rapidly retrieve all data related to food in\na matter of seconds\
    \ [97]. For example, Lin et al. [82] propose a food safety traceability system\
    \ that\nis based on blockchain technology and EPCIS (i.e., a GS1 global standard\
    \ enabling interoperability,\nwhich is also the accepted ISO standard) to simplify\
    \ the process of acquisition, management and\nexchange of product information.\
    \ In this system, consumers can trace information about the food\nthey purchase\
    \ through the consumer traceability client application.\nSimilarly, Hao et al.\
    \ [117]\npropose another blockchain system for the traceability of agricultural\
    \ products. Combined with IoT\nsensors, blockchain technology allows stakeholders\
    \ to provide retrievable data storage records of\nagricultural products. Salah\
    \ et al. [122] suggest an approach that leverages the Ethereum blockchain\nand\
    \ smart contracts to optimize the food traceability processes of soybean across\
    \ the agricultural\nsupply chain. All events and transactions are recorded and\
    \ stored in the blockchain system, providing a\nhigh level of data and information\
    \ transparency and product traceability. Likewise, He et al. [118]\ndevelop a\
    \ decentralized and non-reversible traceability system for optimizing commodity\
    \ data storage.\nAlonso et al. [101] present a platform that combines IoT, edge\
    \ computing, artiﬁcial intelligence and\nblockchain technology to manage farming\
    \ environments. When using blockchain technology, all data\ngenerated by IoT sensors\
    \ are securely recorded for traceability purposes. The goal of maintaining\nend-to-end\
    \ food traceability within a very complex and fragmented FSC is no longer a challenging\n\
    task using blockchain because it creates a common platform for data collection\
    \ all along the FSC.\nBlockchain makes it possible to rapidly track (forward)\
    \ and trace (backward) all batches of products and\nto safely withdraw from the\
    \ market if unsafe or non-compliant with regulations [120]. The application\n\
    of blockchain improves FSC management processes and helps food operators to diﬀerentiate\
    \ products\nbased on their quality attributes. Unlike traditional food traceability\
    \ systems, blockchain technology\ncan ensure the capture of all traceability records\
    \ covering all critical information exchange points\nbetween stakeholders in the\
    \ FSC [89]. Therefore, blockchain technology can increase consumer\nconﬁdence\
    \ in the quality, safety, authenticity, and provenance of food products and related\
    \ data and\ninformation integrity.\nIt should be noted explicitly that food quality,\
    \ safety, authenticity, and provenance must be validated\nthrough analytical science\
    \ methods. For example, data provenance is often confused in blockchain\nmarketing\
    \ with the scientiﬁc provenance of food products. Scientiﬁc provenance (geographic\
    \ source or\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n11 of 26\norigin) can only be guaranteed\
    \ through analytical science methods, such as the Carbon-13 (13C) analysis\nof\
    \ the food or through other scientiﬁc techniques [146]. Furthermore, documents\
    \ (e.g., certiﬁcates,\ncredence claims veriﬁcation such as organic, halal, kosher)\
    \ from analytical science testing can be added\nto a blockchain to enhance the\
    \ data records’ overall integrity. This is especially true if the authoritative\n\
    source (e.g., a laboratory or certiﬁcation body) directly adds the documents to\
    \ the blockchain as they\ncannot be altered [147]. For FSC trading partners, access\
    \ to a blockchain-enabled traceability system\nwith enhanced data integrity for\
    \ food safety, product authenticity and provenance might be highly\nvalued and\
    \ used as a driving force to boost competitiveness and increase consumer purchases\
    \ [47].\n4.1.2. FSC Collaboration\nIncreased supply chain collaboration and integration\
    \ have led to more ﬂexible information\nsharing [148], a more cohesive market\
    \ focus, better coordination of sales and demand fulﬁlment\nand fewer risks related\
    \ to demand uncertainty [149]. Um and Kim [150] conclude that supply chain\ncollaboration\
    \ improves ﬁrm performance and leads to transaction cost advantages. In an FSC\
    \ context,\nsupply chain collaboration is crucial because the agri-food industry\
    \ structure is inherently complex.\nFor example, multi-ingredient food products\
    \ usually comprise an intricate supply chain with several\nbusiness entities and\
    \ multiple information exchanges. Accordingly, when multiple exchange partners\n\
    form a speciﬁc FSC, interoperability issues arise due to non-compatible systems\
    \ required for information\nsharing. To address this issue, blockchain technology\
    \ platforms can utilize GS1 standards to facilitate\ninteroperability among the\
    \ diﬀerent parties of the FSC. On 10 June 2020, the GS1 USA organization\nannounced\
    \ a successful proof of concept for data sharing was completed between four competing\n\
    platforms and solution providers (IBM Food Trust, SAP, RIPE.IO and FoodLogiQ)\
    \ [151]. According to\nBumblauskas et al. [86], blockchain is a suitable solution\
    \ for FSCs and agriculture because of its ability\nto share immutable data between\
    \ exchange partners and automate information sharing processes.\nThe generation\
    \ of rich data in the FSC is well suited for blockchain to support the collection,\n\
    storage and visualization of information.\nMoreover, blockchain technology is\
    \ expected to be a\nbasic data-driven collaboration framework which shortens the\
    \ FSC and oﬀers new opportunities\nfor information sharing and eﬃcient decision-making\
    \ [91]. To streamline the beef FSC processes,\nSurasak et al. [152] develop a\
    \ system that uses blockchain to share information related to location\ntracking,\
    \ temperature, humidity and ownership transfers.\nCompanies advocating greater\
    \ FSC\ntransparency also envision blockchain as a potential solution for accelerating\
    \ across a vast network of\ntrusted exchange partners. For example, IBM launched\
    \ its IBM Food Trust platform, which represents a\ncloud-based, permissioned blockchain\
    \ solution for ensuring a trusted method for participants to share\nfood-related\
    \ data, extract value from others’ contributions, and develop a safer, smarter,\
    \ more eﬃcient\nand sustainable food ecosystem [153]. Blockchain technology is\
    \ a crucial enabler in the FSC, acting as\nthe facilitator of business process\
    \ and role automation (e.g., digitalization), information sharing and\nenhanced\
    \ decision-making. The reviewed literature illustrates the virtues of blockchain\
    \ technology by\nincreasing supply chain visibility and optimizing information\
    \ ﬂows. For instance, Perboli et al. [120]\nargue that blockchain can guarantee\
    \ end-to-end integration and transfer of information ﬂows associated\nwith items\
    \ and batches by driving high and real-time interoperability within existing Enterprise\n\
    Resource Planning (ERP) software. Similarly, Kamble et al. [91] note that blockchain\
    \ can overcome\nseveral eﬃciency and transparency issues in the agricultural supply\
    \ chain as the technology can\nconsolidate links between producers, farmers and\
    \ markets. Furthermore, FSC stakeholders can\noptimize several functions such\
    \ as the movement of highly perishable food products through the supply\nchain\
    \ network and the fast and targeted removal of foods unﬁt for consumption. More\
    \ speciﬁcally,\nblockchain aids in establishing cooperative FSCs by lowering collaboration\
    \ and administrative costs,\nsuch as costs for the design of collaborative agricultural\
    \ activities, the sharing of equipment, tools and\ntransportation [107]. The focus\
    \ on developing more synchronized and collaborative relationships\nbetween FSC\
    \ partners is fostered by blockchain because of its ability to secure resource\
    \ exchanges and\nincrease trust [1].\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n12 of 26\n4.1.3.\
    \ FSC Eﬃciencies\nAs competition has intensiﬁed within and between FSCs, food\
    \ organizations must maintain\nhigher levels of eﬃciencies and deliver added value\
    \ to consumers [90]. Companies that can create\nmore eﬃcient FSCs will be able\
    \ to achieve a signiﬁcant competitive advantage. The digitization\n(and digitalization)\
    \ of supply chains has brought tremendous opportunities for companies and created\n\
    new opportunities and business models [154]. Accordingly, the evolution of FSCs\
    \ has necessitated\nthe deployment of modern technologies to enable process and\
    \ role automation between information\nexchange partners. The adoption of blockchain\
    \ technology can improve inbound eﬃciency and\noptimize planning decisions by\
    \ providing reliable data and information and increasing the visibility\nof supply\
    \ chain inventory and processes [120]. The critical assumption here is that the\
    \ exchange\nparties do not collude to enter false data into the blockchain, which\
    \ is a potential threat to the integrity\nof the FSC. Technology is particularly\
    \ crucial for integrating FSC processes, accelerating the ﬂow\nof information\
    \ (i.e., transparency relates to visibility and ﬂow of information) among FSC\
    \ partners,\nand maximizing the eﬃciency, responsiveness and resilience of the\
    \ food chain to account for changing\nmarket conditions and potential system shocks\
    \ (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). Food enterprises and\nlogistics service providers\
    \ can signiﬁcantly reduce the ineﬃciencies resulting from paperwork and\nother\
    \ fragmented and bureaucratic procedures in the supply chain.\nBlockchain contributes\
    \ to the automation of organizational processes and encourages ﬁrms to\nengage\
    \ in more eﬃcient FSC collaboration. As a result of these beneﬁts, lower costs\
    \ can be achieved\nthrough greater eﬃciency and better access to reliable information.\
    \ Blockchain can reinforce multi-party\ntrust and be combined with other established\
    \ B2B technologies such as EDI, XML and API-based\nB2B [47]. The use of blockchain\
    \ within these systems helps to enhance big data integration and automate\ncertain\
    \ activities within food safety management governance systems. It plays a more\
    \ signiﬁcant role\nin increasing the ﬂexibility of the FSC, the eﬃcient ﬂow of\
    \ information and materials through the\nchain [120], ensuring fresher products\
    \ and faster deliveries, reduced stock levels and quick response to\nconsumer\
    \ demands and concerns. In the case of issues related to food safety, retailers\
    \ can quickly and\neﬃciently trace back along the products’ supply chain to remove\
    \ a speciﬁc batch of contaminated food\ninstead of recalling the entire inventory\
    \ [89]. The speed of locating food products can be done within\nseconds on blockchain\
    \ compared to the same activity in a non-integrated system [90]. This capability\n\
    is beneﬁcial in food poisoning and food fraud, as a recall action of a suspicious\
    \ item is mandatory\nby law and necessary to increase conﬁdence in the brand [89].\
    \ Implementing blockchain in food\nrecall processes in multi-party supply chains\
    \ can further help save costs due to the speciﬁcity or\ngranularity of the recorded\
    \ transactions. Consequently, food companies can prevent defective or unsafe\n\
    food distribution and mitigate potential economic losses and reputational damage\
    \ [110]. Therefore,\nthe integration of blockchain into the food industry gives\
    \ way to a new information architecture for\nFSCs that will replace existing siloed\
    \ databases and fosters sharing all events carried out across the\nsupply chain,\
    \ resulting in streamlined FSC processes.\n4.1.4. Food Trading\nFood is a unique\
    \ commodity, and its trade has signiﬁcant economic importance for both developed\n\
    and developing countries [155]. For example, China’s food trade signiﬁcantly contributes\
    \ to its\nnational economy, the progress of agricultural innovation activities,\
    \ and the population’s nutritional\nhealth status [156]. Although the rapid growth\
    \ of international food trade drastically changed the\nglobal food system over\
    \ the past decades [157] and still exerts a considerable impact on sustainable\n\
    economic development, there are multiple technological problems in today’s FSCs,\
    \ according to\nMao et al. [83]. To address these issues and promote food trade\
    \ practices among the many FSC\nstakeholders, blockchain technology can be used\
    \ to enforce automated trading mechanisms [83].\nThe application of blockchain\
    \ brings enhanced optimization and automation to business processes\nand roles\
    \ between trading relationships and increases trust in exchange transactions.\
    \ The auditability of\nblockchain technology is a crucial feature by which FSCs\
    \ can establish an authoritative record for trade\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n13\
    \ of 26\ndata and information, perform real-time order checking and achieve visibility\
    \ regarding inventory levels\nand automatic reconciliation of invoices [91]. Moreover,\
    \ blockchain can expand food trade through\nthe removal of certain trade restrictions.\
    \ It can accelerate commercialization processes—blockchain\nguarantees all FSC\
    \ exchange partners can attain information symmetry, credibility and trust [125].\n\
    Similarly, several companies consider blockchain a workable solution for managing\
    \ trade-related\ndocumentation and streamlining borderless transactions [3]. Global\
    \ FSC trading partners can beneﬁt\nfrom blockchain’s ability to reduce logistics\
    \ costs, streamline transportation processes and formalize\ntrade relationships.\
    \ Also, blockchain has the potential to dismantle speciﬁc trade barriers and create\n\
    new market opportunities for ﬁrms to grow, thrive and become more competitive.\
    \ Mao et al. [125]\nnote that blockchain can open up new avenues for trade that\
    \ extend beyond national boundaries by\nenhancing traceability and eﬃciency in\
    \ trade and addressing food safety issues. Blockchain technology\nrepresents a\
    \ signiﬁcant paradigm shift in terms of how transactions are conducted [3]. Therefore,\n\
    the implementation of blockchain in the FSC can enable organizations to perform\
    \ business beyond\nexisting corporate boundaries almost as eﬀectively and eﬃciently\
    \ as they operate within the ﬁrm.\n4.2. Challenges of Blockchain Technology in\
    \ FSCs\n4.2.1. Technical Challenges\nAccording to Behnke and Janssen [1], several\
    \ technical issues of blockchain remain unresolved,\ndespite the advantages it\
    \ oﬀers in FSCs. For example, scalability needs to be addressed because the\n\
    technology might become ineﬃcient if the number of FSC transactions is increasing\
    \ exponentially [114].\nThe validation process of transactions might limit the\
    \ applicability of blockchain and reduce transaction\neﬃciency in situations of\
    \ high transaction throughput [125]. Wu et al. [114] argue that blockchains\n\
    are not suitable for FSCs in general because the technology has a limited capacity\
    \ to handle and\nstore massive amounts of data. The authors further note that\
    \ a multi-tier supply chain network\nnecessitates the processing of many transactions\
    \ in a short period, and blockchain technology can lead\nto transaction ineﬃciencies\
    \ as well as redundancies. Perboli et al. [120] stress that the performance\n\
    of blockchain still lags when compared with transaction-based technologies such\
    \ as Visa, which is\ncapable of handling thousands of transactions per second\
    \ on average. In contrast, a Bitcoin blockchain,\nis tremendously lower in both\
    \ transaction speed and volume. Although several solutions are currently\nunderway\
    \ to address the limited scalability of blockchain, they are still in a nascent\
    \ development\nstage. As an illustration, the use of oﬀ-chain data storage can\
    \ improve the eﬃciency of blockchain;\nhowever, this solution may surface new\
    \ issues related to data integrity and privacy [114]. Therefore,\nthe application\
    \ of blockchain in the FSC depends on high scalability and decentralization [103]\
    \ so that\nFSC operations become smoother and more ﬂexible.\nBlockchain-based\
    \ FSCs require more intelligence and automation to increase the resiliency of\
    \ the\nfood supply network by lessening the restrictions for users to join, execute\
    \ transactions, and access\nsmart contracts’ source codes [115]. Code errors and\
    \ security vulnerabilities might result in signiﬁcant\nﬁnancial losses for FSC\
    \ actors. Wu et al. [114] claim that blockchain might be subject to several security\n\
    threats such as a mining attack, which can put food companies at risk of data\
    \ and revenue loss,\nwhereas Zhao et al. [100] highlight that the decentralized\
    \ architecture of blockchain and its integration\nwith an extensive peer-to-peer\
    \ wireless sensor network might give rise to several privacy and security\nissues\
    \ in the agri-food value chain. Zhao et al. [100] claim that operating a blockchain\
    \ may entail\nan unprecedented level of transparency and visibility of FSC processes\
    \ leading to a potential risk\nin conﬁdentiality. Blockchains may not guarantee\
    \ privacy for FSC actors as information will be\navailable and accessible to all\
    \ members belonging to a network. If information is deemed strategic,\nconﬁdential\
    \ or secret, food ﬁrms might be hesitant to engage in blockchain-based FSCs until\
    \ the risk\ncan be mitigated [114].\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n14 of 26\n4.2.2.\
    \ Organizational Challenges\nThe technological immaturity of blockchains is a\
    \ signiﬁcant barrier to its adoption in the FSC\nalongside the nascent nature\
    \ of research and development [121]. The immaturity level of the technology\n\
    exacerbates the uncertainties concerning its usefulness for FSC activities [127].\
    \ Many blockchain\nprojects in the food industry are in a proof-of-concept stage\
    \ of development. As such, many blockchain\nstart-ups and established technology\
    \ ﬁrms have introduced solutions based on blockchain technology,\nbut not many\
    \ applications have gone beyond a pilot stage [1]. Moreover, food organizations\
    \ interested\nin adopting blockchain might be hesitant to place the technology\
    \ at the core of their organizational\nprocesses due to the lack of previous experiences.\
    \ Longo et al. [47] state that FSC players, such as\nfood manufacturers, logistics\
    \ operators and especially small- and medium-sized food enterprises,\nmust invest\
    \ more resources and money in harnessing and operating a blockchain-enabled supply\n\
    chain. The initial set up and maintenance costs might outweigh the beneﬁts of\
    \ such FSCs. Firms with\nlimited ﬁnancial resources might be unable to increase\
    \ their adaptation capabilities, thereby being at a\ncompetitive disadvantage\
    \ compared to their competitors. Failure to understand that the adoption of\n\
    blockchain needs enhanced organizational capabilities can result in severe operational\
    \ problems.\nIn terms of implementation costs, the use of blockchain might require\
    \ signiﬁcant capital\ninvestments [158]. Klerkx et al. [127] argue that the digitalization\
    \ of supply chain processes requires\nthe mobilization of diverse skills, knowledge,\
    \ and materials to translate digital data and capabilities\ninto better decisions\
    \ for FSC management. The novelty of blockchain technology presents additional\n\
    challenges for FSC operators because they may be unfamiliar with the principles\
    \ (e.g., immutability),\nfunctioning, and maintenance of the technology [100].\
    \ Therefore, the need arises to develop workers’\nskills and technical understanding\
    \ and capabilities to ensure eﬀective implementation. Moreover,\nin the digitalization\
    \ of FSC processes and the automation of manual roles, blockchain technology may\n\
    force worker layoﬀs and poses a threat to the digitally illiterate [127].\n4.2.3.\
    \ Regulatory Challenges\nTo ensure the sustainable functioning of blockchain-enabled\
    \ FSCs, food industry stakeholders\nhave to follow regional, national and international\
    \ policies and regulations [85]. Government support\nand regulations can be a\
    \ driving force for the greater diﬀusion of the technology. Furthermore,\nblockchain\
    \ technology implementation should be seen as a facilitator for regulatory and\
    \ certiﬁcation\nnorms, especially those requiring the traceability of food products\
    \ [80]. The lack of industry standards\nrelated to blockchain technology makes\
    \ it hard to integrate all FSC exchange partners into a single\nregulatory framework.\n\
    However, the GS1 EPCIS-enabled protocol from Origin Trail oﬀers an\nopen-source\
    \ solution to address the problem of blockchain to blockchain and blockchain to\
    \ legacy\ninteroperability (other solutions may also exist). Cooperation among\
    \ diﬀerent industry players needs\nto be fostered to ensure greater regulatory\
    \ harmonization. GS1 standards are also intended to aid FSCs\nto collaborate on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects of regulatory compliance (e.g., traceability, recall, product\
    \ and trading\nparty identity, farm or factory identity and location, labelling).\
    \ Misconceptions regarding blockchain\ntechnology need to be addressed as they\
    \ may result in regulatory and legal restrictions and limit the\nvalue obtained\
    \ from adopting the technology [80]. In this respect, Behnke and Janssen [1] maintain\
    \ that\nstandardization of food traceability processes and the development of\
    \ a uniﬁed framework is a crucial\nboundary requirement before blockchain can\
    \ be applied to the FSC. As a result, blockchain promoters in\ngovernmental roles\
    \ need to involve technical experts to establish the regulation upon which blockchain\n\
    technology can be developed.\n5. Discussion, Implications and Conclusions\n5.1.\
    \ General Discussion\nIn this paper, we synthesize the current knowledge base\
    \ concerning the potentials and challenges\nof blockchain in the FSC. We report\
    \ ﬁndings from an SLR and bibliometric analysis showcasing the\nLogistics 2020,\
    \ 4, 0027\n15 of 26\nrole of blockchain in the food industry. The network and\
    \ content analysis results show that blockchain\nis a promising technology and\
    \ an eﬀective solution for modernizing FSCs [159].\nThe intrinsic\ncharacteristics\
    \ of blockchain have the potential to solve several problems inherent to FSCs.\
    \ For example,\nfood companies using blockchain technology can enhance product\
    \ traceability and quickly identify\nthe location and source of products implicated\
    \ in a food safety recall, adulteration, or counterfeit.\nNumerous studies advocate\
    \ using blockchain as a means for achieving end-to-end product traceability,\n\
    making the tracking and tracing of food products feasible at every point in the\
    \ supply chain [160].\nIt can be noted that traceability of food products can\
    \ be done without blockchain. However, it is\noften cumbersome and ineﬃcient when\
    \ multiple stakeholders are involved due to a frequent lack\nof interoperability\
    \ and the limitations of a one-up/one-down regulatory requirement for traceability.\n\
    Blockchain-based traceability can help determine the diﬀerent actors’ identity,\
    \ food product identity,\norigins, and all related information [161]. From a supply\
    \ chain perspective, blockchain will help\nto ensure eﬃcient and trusted transactions\
    \ while simultaneously enhancing traceability and recall\ncapability, aiding food\
    \ safety and the rapid identiﬁcation of potential food fraud, counterfeits and\n\
    other forms of illicit trade [162]. Blockchain can reduce information asymmetry\
    \ and provide more\naccurate, timely and trusted information to the public while\
    \ minimizes damage to a company’s brand\nimage and reputation.\nOur ﬁndings also\
    \ highlight the value of blockchain for FSC collaboration. More speciﬁcally,\n\
    blockchain provides opportunities for FSC stakeholders to collaborate more eﬃciently\
    \ and eﬀectively,\nincreasing trust in business interactions. In FSCs, trust is\
    \ a precursor or antecedent for successful\ncollaborative arrangements and vital\
    \ for information sharing and transparency [163]. As a result,\nfood companies\
    \ can rely on blockchain to forge closer partner collaboration, sustain FSC activities,\n\
    and mitigate the adverse eﬀects of process failures.\nSimilarly, blockchain deployment\
    \ for FSC\ncollaboration can be an impetus for higher supply chain responsiveness\
    \ and organizational performance.\nOur ﬁndings suggest that blockchain may lead\
    \ to better performance in process automation,\ninformation sharing and decision\
    \ synchronization. FSC stakeholders can beneﬁt from using blockchain\nto foster\
    \ collaboration among the diﬀerent tiers of the food chain since the exchange\
    \ of information and\nresources is independently veriﬁed by blockchain participants\
    \ and can be inspected by food suppliers,\ndistributors and customers. It is also\
    \ conceivable that the technology can be a means by which all\nFSC stakeholders\
    \ can be involved in a collaborative environment that promotes shared responsibility,\n\
    fairness and transparency [163].\nBlockchain is anticipated to synchronize information\
    \ sharing among FSC stakeholders to\nsigniﬁcantly reduce excess inventory and\
    \ protect against the harmful bullwhip eﬀect. Thanks to\nthe increased visibility\
    \ of FSC processes, blockchain helps the food industry stakeholders\novercome\
    \ the common problems of conventional collaborative systems by enhancing response\n\
    time, increasing cost-eﬀectiveness, reducing potential errors, and assuring instant\
    \ availability of\naccurate and reliable FSC information [164]. Therefore, it\
    \ is essential to integrate blockchain in FSC\ncollaboration to establish trust\
    \ in the relationships among FSC partners, which is a critical element for\nachieving\
    \ successful collaborative practices. Successful collaborative practices also\
    \ open opportunities\nfor social sustainability. When it comes to human rights\
    \ and fair work, a complete record of a product’s\nhistory helps product buyers\
    \ be conﬁdent that their purchase originates from ethically sound sources.\nSeveral\
    \ studies stress blockchain’s ability to improve the operational eﬃciencies of\
    \ FSCs. In this\nregard, the most apparent feature of blockchain to increase eﬃciency\
    \ is disintermediation by helping\nFSC partners automate business transactions,\
    \ reduce lead times, and reduce costs. Blockchain can create\nan ecosystem wherein\
    \ frictionless value transfers can be performed eﬃciently. The automation of FSC\n\
    transactions paves the way to optimizing FSC processes such as food sourcing,\
    \ ordering and distribution,\nthereby helping businesses identify potential sources\
    \ of process ineﬃciencies, redundant tasks and\nfraud. The virtues of getting\
    \ an improved view of the ﬂow of food products can aid FSC partners\nin managing\
    \ their production, inventory, and food safety mechanisms, thereby reducing food\
    \ waste\nand spoilage. Blockchain coordinates FSC operations to enable faster\
    \ customer responsiveness and\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n16 of 26\nmaximize customer\
    \ service levels. It may help reduce the size and scope of rework and recalls\
    \ by\ndelivering these services, thus providing considerable greenhouse gas reductions\
    \ and other resource\nsavings. Access to more complete longitudinal supply chain\
    \ datasets will lead to improved practices,\nincluding eliminating redundancies\
    \ and bottlenecks, and ultimately, decreases in resource consumption,\nall of\
    \ which are positive outcomes of blockchain technology from a sustainability perspective\
    \ [165].\nAdditionally, FSC stakeholders must consider the integration of blockchain\
    \ in their trading\nprocesses. The opportunity to develop a fair-trade environment\
    \ is frequently highlighted in the\nreviewed literature. The persistent ineﬃciencies\
    \ associated with the movement of food products from\none country to another can\
    \ be partially resolved with blockchain. In this sense, blockchain can simplify\n\
    food trade logistics and distribution, eliminating information asymmetry and establishing\
    \ a more\ncredible and sustainable food trading environment.\nOur review of the\
    \ literature also scrutinizes the challenges encountered when deploying technology\n\
    in the food industry. For example, the technical limitations of blockchain, including\
    \ scalability, security,\nand privacy issues [166], represent a signiﬁcant hindrance\
    \ to its application in FSCs. In practice,\nscalability is crucial when deciding\
    \ to deploy blockchain because the technology might not be suitable\nfor managing\
    \ FSC data, especially when substantial, high-velocity information needs to be\
    \ processed.\nThe storage capacity and performance of blockchain might not work\
    \ for data-intensive FSCs since all\nblocks must store a copy of all transaction\
    \ data fed into the network, resulting in data redundancy.\nAlthough several solutions\
    \ have been introduced to improve scalability, further eﬀorts are needed to\n\
    develop highly scalable blockchains that respond to the needs of all FSC stakeholders.\
    \ Furthermore,\nusing blockchain in a multi-tier FSC network poses additional\
    \ risks for security attacks and privacy\nintrusions [167,168] due to the technology’s\
    \ decentralized architecture.\nConsequently, if FSC partners feel that their business\
    \ information is not secure, they will be\ndiscouraged from using blockchain.\
    \ Previous research also shows that the adoption of blockchain in the\nFSC may\
    \ be slowed down by many organizational factors such as technology immaturity,\
    \ resistance to\nchange and the lack of necessary resources and operational capabilities\
    \ [169]. Applying blockchain for\nFSCs is still a challenging endeavor as the\
    \ technology and its design are still unable to cope with highly\nglobalized FSCs.\
    \ The uncertainties surrounding the technology and the fear of losing control\
    \ may\nexplain many managers’ reluctance to support blockchain-enabled business\
    \ models. FSC actors might\nbe unwilling to operate in a blockchain environment\
    \ [170] if their competitors develop a competitive\nedge by concealing a particular\
    \ product or processing information. Moreover, the commitment of\nsigniﬁcant resources\
    \ for the engagement in a blockchain operational model is highlighted in the\n\
    literature as a pressing challenge for small and budget-constrained FSC partners\
    \ because they are\nrequired to incur additional costs for organizational development\
    \ capabilities and system maintenance.\nLastly, the literature also discusses\
    \ regulatory issues facing blockchain adoption in FSCs [55]. The legal\nenvironment\
    \ of blockchain is still full of uncertainties [171]. For example, there is a\
    \ need for regulations\nand industry standards that FSC stakeholders can refer\
    \ to when encountering potential incidents\nwhile operating in a blockchain setting.\
    \ Therefore, industry standards and regulatory initiatives are\nnecessary to accelerate\
    \ blockchain adoption in FSCs and develop best practices and protocols for\nFSC\
    \ interoperability.\n5.2. Implications for Researchers and Practitioners\nThe\
    \ pressing need for maintaining highly eﬃcient, integrated and responsive FSCs\
    \ is driving\nresearchers and organizations to rethink the supply chain design.\
    \ Substantial eﬀorts are devoted to\nstudying promising opportunities for this\
    \ technology in the food industry. The ﬁndings of this study are\nuseful for researchers\
    \ to capture the dynamics surrounding blockchain technology. More speciﬁcally,\n\
    we unfold the potential areas where food organizations can use blockchain to add\
    \ substantial business\nvalue and achieve sustainable performance. Reviewing the\
    \ potentials and challenges of blockchain is\ncrucial for leading FSC stakeholders,\
    \ who need to scrutinize the technology enablers to create strategies\nand policies,\
    \ incentivizing the transition from conventional FSC systems to blockchain.\n\
    Logistics 2020, 4, 0027\n17 of 26\nInnovation in blockchain through improved scalability,\
    \ performance and security, can contribute to\nthe wide-scale implementation of\
    \ the technology in FSCs. Regulatory bodies and key FSC stakeholders\nthat exert\
    \ pressure on transitioning toward blockchain-driven FSCs need to develop policies\
    \ and\nstandards that facilitate regulatory document expedition and streamline\
    \ business processes, such as\nthe checking, control, control, monitoring and\
    \ certiﬁcation of food products. The shift toward a\nblockchain ecosystem may\
    \ necessitate a diﬀerent modus operandi regarding the orchestration of FSCs.\n\
    Therefore, we recommend that food organizations and stakeholders diminish the\
    \ main barriers to\nblockchain adoption at the organizational level (i.e., resistance\
    \ to change) and develop the organization’s\nneeded operational capabilities by\
    \ providing specialized corporate training programs and developing\nsystems to\
    \ enhance coordination and information sharing between FSC partners. Blockchain\
    \ has the\npotential to empower the technological advancement of FSCs as it can\
    \ augment the capabilities of\nother Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IoT, Big\
    \ Data, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Augmented Reality and\nCyber-Physical Systems\
    \ to generate new eﬃciencies. Thus, managers and practitioners need to be\ncognizant\
    \ of the transition toward blockchain-enabled FSCs to deliver high quality, safe\
    \ and authentic\nfood to consumers.\nManagers should also be aware of the additional\
    \ challenges and tensions that can emerge\nfrom blockchain adoption, and they\
    \ should work to overcome issues threatening the sustainable\nfunctioning of FSCs.\
    \ This study reveals that blockchain adoption in FSCs is worthwhile in terms of\n\
    food traceability, collaborative relationships, operational eﬃciencies, and food\
    \ trade activities. Thus,\nmanagers need to ensure their digital transformation\
    \ plans consider the potential transformative power\nof blockchain-based business\
    \ models. Investments in blockchain promise improved food traceability,\ntrust,\
    \ transparency and eﬃcient use of resources, and strong relationships with customers\
    \ and supply\nchain partners, which can help food ﬁrms sustain their competitive\
    \ advantage.\nOur literature review framework provides a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of opportunities and\nconstraints of blockchain in the FSC that drives or impedes\
    \ sustainable management to inspire further\nresearch. We propose the following\
    \ research gaps that need further attention and investigation:\n•\nThis review\
    \ highlights the potentials of blockchain for FSCs. However, insuﬃcient attention\n\

    \ food\norganizations, namely, raw materials procurement, inventory management,\
    \ document and\ncredentials management, speciﬁcation and recipe management, product\
    \ life cycle management,\nquality management and the role of smart contracts.\n\

    \ overcome problems and bottlenecks of organizational performance remains\nunknown.\
    \ Another important research topic is examining the impact of blockchain on FSC\n\
    resource sharing, decision synchronization and joint knowledge creation.\n•\n\
    Future research needs to provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of blockchain\
    \ on FSC\nperformance and provide clear guidelines on how to tailor blockchain\
    \ characteristics to increase\nthe eﬃciency of FSCs and respond to the needs of\
    \ all stakeholders involved in the food industry.\nThe framework that emerged\
    \ from the literature analysis can be a starting tool to map the diﬀerent\nneeds\

    \ products. Additionally, researchers should focus on the use of blockchain\n\
    to design mechanisms for more sustainable and ethical food production, thereby\
    \ improving\nconsumer satisfaction and trust in food products.\n•\nFuture studies\
    \ need to examine blockchain’s added value when used together with forensic testing\n\
    methods to ensure food authenticity, provenance, and safety.\n•\nAdditional case\
    \ studies need to be conducted to validate the diverse themes of our framework\n\
    and highlight the applicability and suitability of blockchain to diverse areas\
    \ in the FSC.\n•\nResearchers are required to elaborate on blockchain’s role to\
    \ foster FSC sustainability, detailing the\nimpact of the technology on economic,\
    \ social and environmental dimensions of FSC sustainability.\nAddressing this\
    \ knowledge gap is necessary to grasp the transformational impact of technology\n\
    on the economy and society.\n5.3. Conclusions\nAn essential task of a literature\
    \ review is to provide a timely synthesis and analysis of published\nliterature.\
    \ Even though previous studies have explored the numerous possibilities of blockchain\n\
    technology in supply chain management, they have not captured the latest technology\
    \ developments\nfrom the FSC perspective. Therefore, our review study aims to\
    \ enhance scholars’ understanding\nregarding the potentials and challenges of\
    \ leveraging blockchain in the food industry.\nIn this study, we employ an SLR\
    \ and investigate the current state of knowledge on blockchain\napplications in\
    \ the FSC. The review was conducted with sixty-one (61) relevant journal articles,\n\
    which were thoroughly examined and analyzed using bibliometric tools and techniques.\
    \ This study\nreveals that blockchain technology is still in a nascent stage and\
    \ has a potentially transformational and\nfoundational (rather than disruptive)\
    \ impact on the FSC. As for the beneﬁts of the technology, we found\nthat blockchain\
    \ adoption can improve food traceability, enhance FSC collaborative relationships,\n\
    maximize operational eﬃciencies, and sustain food trading activities. The downsides\
    \ of blockchain\nmainly fall under three categories, namely, technical, organizational\
    \ and regulatory barriers. Issues,\nincluding blockchain scalability, security\
    \ and privacy, are the key factors inhibiting the widespread\nimplementation of\
    \ the technology. The lack of standards and regulatory support is also expected\
    \ to\nrestrain blockchain’s value in the food industry.\nThrough conducting this\
    \ review, our primary goal is to inform scholars and practitioners on\nthe importance\
    \ of blockchain technology in sustaining FSCs. Moreover, we seek to summarize\
    \ the\ncurrent research state and provide several implications for researchers\
    \ and practitioners. Furthermore,\nthe compilation of our review and its ﬁndings\
    \ should encourage further research in the ﬁeld. Aside from\noﬀering valuable\
    \ contributions to the blockchain literature and deepening the extant literature’s\
    \ overall\nunderstanding, we highlighted the main knowledge domains.\nFrom a theoretical\
    \ perspective, we provide three contributions. First, this paper adds to the few\n\
    studies that have previously explored blockchain technology in the FSC. Second,\
    \ we synthesize related\nliterature using keyword co-occurrence and bibliographic\
    \ coupling techniques. So far, bibliometric\nmethods have not fully exploited\
    \ the review of blockchain research in the food area. Hence, this study\noﬀers\
    \ a detailed analysis and timely synthesis of the literature. Third, our ﬁndings\
    \ identify several areas\nthat are not suﬃciently dealt with, such as blockchain\
    \ technology’s role in enhancing FSC sustainability\nthrough better collaborations\
    \ with partners in multi-tier global food supply networks.\nThis review has several\
    \ practical implications. For instance, blockchain technology beneﬁts may\nprovide\
    \ a reference for practitioners interested in understanding the expected outcomes\
    \ from the\ndeployment of the technology in the FSC. The welfare of various FSC\
    \ stakeholders such as food\nsuppliers, producers, retailers and ﬁnal consumers\
    \ may be substantially improved with blockchain\ntechnology.\nIn this regard,\
    \ this review can help practitioners to understand these far-reaching\nimplications\
    \ better. In contrast, blockchain challenges may guide FSC managers to identify\
    \ the pain\npoints encountered by organizations during the shift toward blockchain-enabled\
    \ FSCs.\nLogistics 2020, 4, 0027\n19 of 26\nAs with any research, this study has\
    \ some limitations. The selection of Scopus for the collection\nof the literature\
    \ does not guarantee the full coverage of research works published on blockchain\n\
    technology from the FSC context. The ﬁnal list of retrieved articles was generated\
    \ based on the set of\nsearch keywords used. Although keyword entries provide\
    \ a comprehensive list of research articles,\nthe remaining keywords may not be\
    \ exhaustive. Future studies may want to consider using other\ndatabases such\
    \ as ISI Web of Science. We also recommend that researchers empirically validate\
    \ the\nresearch questions raised in this review using surveys and case studies.\n\

    Under a Creative Commons license open access Abstract Blockchain is today one
    of the most interesting and debated research topics. Blockchain technology was
    implemented for the first time in the financial sector a few years ago. However,
    it is currently used in many other areas, such as: healthcare, smart cities, smart
    contracts, energy markets, government sector. The success of this technology mainly
    lies in the following properties: reliability, transparency, immutability. In
    this study, we collect and analyze the main contributions in the literature about
    the application of blockchain in the agricultural sector, focusing on food traceability
    issues. Considering the quick growth of this technology and the high number of
    published documents in recent months, there is a need to catalog the different
    methodologies, proposed by the various scholars. Our aim is to detect the current
    research trends and possible future challenges. In the agricultural context, the
    need for an adequate traceability system is motivated by several bad habits and
    problems, such as the wide use of pesticides and fertilizers in fruits and vegetables,
    which are extremely harmful for human health. Moreover, in the last few years,
    the consumers’ attention about the quality of agricultural products has considerably
    increased. The present study shows that the blockchain technology is still in
    its early stage. Although there are several proposals in the literature, still
    a limited number of applications have been put into use in the real context. From
    the point of view of scientific research, only some countries are investing in
    this technology: China and United States are among the most active, but Italy
    is also very involved in this phenomenon. Overall, the blockchain technology appears
    very promising, but still many efforts are needed to reach the maturation stage.

    daily lives to facilitate control and monitoring of objects to revolutionize the
    ways that human interacts with physical world. IoT system includes large volume
    of data with network connectivity, power, and storage resources to transform data
    into meaningful information. Blockchain has decentralized nature to provide useful
    mechanism for addressing IoT challenges. Blockchain is distributed ledger with
    fundamental attributes, namely recorded, transparent, and decentralized. Blockchain
    formed participants in distributed ledger to record the transactions and communicate

    is used to generate the large-scale index as security measure for all network
    communication. It operated as mutual, collective and common ledger. With development
    of crypto currencies, blockchain technology is said to be disruptive technology.
    It performed the transition from client-server to secured network. Blockchain
    is an immutable ledger for performing financial transactions. It has chain of
    time-stamped blocks associated with cryptographic hashes. It enabled the users
    in allocating the P2P network in which non-trusting members swap the data without
    intermediary. Trust is an essential block chain achieved through resultant hash
    of preceding block for generating the subsequent block. The resulting hash is
    authenticated by the miner nodes for finding the hash for the subsequent block.
    A bunch of transactions are coupled into the blocks by using Merkle tree. Merkle
    root hash is included in the block. A blockchain is a ledger spreading over the
    blockchain system. Blockchain comprised many connected blocks. The first block
    is termed as genesis block without parent block. A block structure comprised:
    Block version - collection of block validation which regulates to proceed. Hash
    of parent block - a 256-bit field that contains a hash value which points to the
    earlier block. Timestamp recording present time in seconds. Nonce from 0 and improve
    hash computation. Number of transactions MerkleRoot – accumulates hash value of
    all the transactions in the block. A blockchain is developing with the executed
    transactions. Once block is produced, all nodes are included in block corroboration.
    A validated block is included at the ending of blockchain by the reference symbolizing
    the parent block. The emerging technology has large potential impacts in many
    technological areas and Internet of Things in various aspects with decentralization,
    communications, transaction models and independent device coordination as described
    in [1]. The objective was to provide the ideas with structure and operation of
    Blockchain to examine technology usage for improving the privacy level in IoT.
    But the computational cost was not minimized. A new framework with layers termed
    Blockchain Structures (BCS) was introduced in [2] to identify association between
    IoT and BC for verification. Every BCS was arranged through Blockchain technology.
    However, it fails in improving the security level. The Blockchain and IoT technologies
    was integrated in [3] with high-level solutions for handling the shortcomings
    and limitations of both IoT and Blockchain technologies. Identification of exact
    problem in IoT and Blockchain technologies was not performed. The comprehensive
    review was carried out in [4] with block chain and IoT integration. The objective
    was to examine research trends on BC-related technologies in IoT context. It studied
    different application domains and arranging the literature with categorization
    but failed in resolving the complexity issues. The centralized architecture was
    constructed in [5] for minimizing the computational overhead. A distributed access
    control method was developed for device-to-device communication in IoT-enabled
    computerization. The security and privacy preservation were essential problems
    in centralized architecture. But, energy consumption of centralized architecture
    was higher. Channel State Information (CSI)-free strategies were introduced in
    [6] with large number of devices. CSI reduced as powered devices count gets increased.
    The distributed CSI-free plans increased energy coverage region with high reliability.
    However, the execution time was found to be higher. A comprehensive review of
    machine learning was carried out to identify potential benefits and problems for
    applications in 5G networks. QC-assisted and QML-based framework was introduced
    in [7] for 6G communication networks through addressing challenges. But it failed
    in improving the reliability level. Optical wireless communication (OWC) served
    5GB communication system demands. OWC technologies were used in [8] for exploitation
    of 5G/6G and IoT. The communication overhead of OWC served 5GB communication system
    was higher. The key technologies were reviewed in [9] to recognize every feature.
    Teraherz (THz) communications were employed to maintain mobile ultra-broadband,
    symbiotic radio and satellite-assisted communications. However, data integrity
    was lower. An integrated IoT platform with blockchain was introduced in [10] to
    assure the sensing data integrity. The main aim was to pay for device owner for
    effortless access to the devices in diverse areas. It presented the features of
    IoT systems for monitoring and controlling the end user. But communication overhead
    remains unaddressed. A secure and intelligent architecture was constructed in
    [11] for wireless networks through joining AI and blockchain to allow secure resource
    sharing. A blockchain empowered content caching issues were addressed to increase
    the system effectiveness and establish caching scheme through deep reinforcement
    learning. In secure and intelligent architecture, the privacy level of data was
    poor. The security module of IoT device was introduced in [12] depending on blockchain
    technology to avoid hacking and information infringement. The designed technology
    formed blockchain system with multi-security among IoT and user device. However,
    security level was not enhanced through authentication. The new technologies were
    introduced in [13] with wireless networks towards 6G for several cases. A full-stack,
    system-level viewpoint on 6G requirements were reviewed and chosen 6G machineries
    through introducing new communication models. But, central authority was not provided
    for enhancing the security level. A decentralized and cryptographically strong
    platform was introduced in [14] with immutability to avoid central authority utilization
    for authentication and communication. However, data confidentiality level was
    not improved. The blockchain technology addressed the problems with new facilities
    like distributed to improve the security level. Distributed ledger technologies
    were introduced in [15] to present solution for security and privacy problems.
    Though privacy was preserved, the execution time was not reduced. Table 1 describes
    the list of abbreviations in the article. TABLE 1 List of Abbreviations A. Related
    Works Several review papers distributed by various authors on blockchain in 6G-enabled
    IoT for automation. Scope of Survey: As per the requirement of the survey paper,
    research in the direction of IoT and BC is to be considered. A lot of research
    is required to be done for addressing the issues of security with the blockchain
    technology solution. Research is to be carried out to enable the scalability of
    the integrating blockchain with IoT. Many reviews based on author knowledge concentrated
    on security problems and determined the suitability of block chain to perform
    secured communication. A study was also taken for block chain technology, 6G network,
    IoT with taxonomy of the security problems. However, a complete survey that focuses
    all probable security susceptibilities of communication system is not available.
    Some literatures failed to portray about the incorporation of block chain technology
    and 5G network. In [16], the effectiveness of combining blockchain for IoT in
    different applications was presented by studying Blockchain-enabled Intelligent
    IoT framework with Artificial Intelligence. But computational power and latency
    issues were not resolved. Later, Blockchain based decentralized application was
    employed in [17] for allowing IoT edge processing. It remains possible for the
    resource owner to integrate the ecosystem and provide necessitated resources.
    Edge computation was carried out by IoT devices to resource owner nodes if needed.
    An architectural framework was studied in [18] to enable blockchain in IoT applications.
    An oneM2M-based IoT platform and blockchain system termed Logchain was employed
    to guarantee block integrity. But security issues remains unaddressed. Blockchain
    and Edge Computing were joined in [19] to deal with the inhibited nature of IoT.
    Framework was constructed to minimize IoT device needs for memory capacity and
    to enhance performance results. The challenges were evaluated with the Blockchain
    and Edge Computing architecture. However, resource optimization was not performed.
    The techno-economic factors and normative assumptions were taken in [20] to enable
    the propertization. Blockchain applications include the results opposite to intended
    ones for contributing the IoT based user privacy. But, the privacy level of data
    remains low. In [21], the convergence of blockchain and IoT was discussed. However,
    the data analytics on blockchain data remains difficult. A full-fledged approach
    for the engineering was developed in [22] by combining the Aggregate Computing
    and Opportunistic IoT Service models. But the computational complexity remains
    unaddressed. The opportunities and challenges associated to blockchain convention
    in 6G were discussed in [15]. However, Security level was not enhanced. The reshaping
    and conversion of DTs by Blockchain was discussed in [23] to secure manufacturing.
    But privacy issues were not concerned. In [24], the utilization of blockchain
    for value extraction in 5G was discussed. The existing centralized architecture
    was described in [25] for handling the huge volume of data created in the IoT.
    It experiences security and privacy issues. The key characteristics of cognitive-inspired
    computing were explained in [26] for resolving the security and privacy issues.
    An intelligent data fusion algorithm based on hybrid delay-aware clustering (HDC)
    was presented in [27]. The clustering patterns of the cluster were chosen by the
    decision function to achieve optimize between network delay and energy consumption.
    However, the execution time was higher. Dynamic spectrum access algorithm was
    designed in [28] depended on game theory to perform spectrum leasing and interference
    mitigation among Secondary Users. But computational cost remains higher. In order
    to resolve the security issues, counter the threats and to provide efficiency,
    a new authentication scheme for demand response management was designed in [29].
    But the data integrity level remains lower. Later, A temporal credential based
    anonymous lightweight authentication scheme (TCALAS) was developed in [30] for
    Internet of Drones (IoD) networks. TCALAS provided security against threats. In
    [31], a secure routing and monitoring protocol with multi-variant tuples using
    Two-Fish (TF) symmetric key approach was designed. It helped to avoid the adversaries
    in the global sensor network. But the reliability level was poor. Table 2 explained
    the summary of surveys and variations with proposed review. TABLE 2 Challenges
    of Blockchain With IoT for 6G B. Contribution of This Survey At present several
    review papers were examined in literature, however the possible security problems
    of blockchain enabled IoT with 6G were not addressed anywhere. The main contributions
    of the article are: Examine the security problems with blockchain enabled IoT
    with 6G communication network and describe comprehensive analysis on it. Establish
    an in-depth study of research challenges in incorporation of blockchain with 6G
    communication network. Address the open problems and suggest the future research
    guidelines toward blockchain enabled IoT with 6G communication. C. Organization

    outline of blockchain technologies with blockchain benefits for 6G is explained
    in Section 2. In Section 3, integration of IoT in blockchain is discussed. Section
    4 describes the research challenges of blockchain with IoT enabled devices. Section
    5 portrays blockchain and IoT integration solutions. Section 6 explains the application
    of blockchain with 6G enabled IoT devices. Section 7 concludes the paper. FIGURE
    1. Structure of survey article. Show All SECTION II. Background The background
    and history of blockchain, 6G and IoT is explained in this section. In addition,
    how IoT affects the 6G communication and how BC secure communication networks
    are described. A. Blockchain Technologies A sequence of blocks linked by hash
    value of preceding block is termed as Blockchain (BC). A block accumulated the
    data. In BC, authority gets decentralized where each member of BC network legalizes
    the transaction. Every transaction gets marked and validation is carried out through
    verifying the transaction by the entire mining node in network. The node included
    immutable transaction records between BC parties. BC addressed the third-party
    system requirements for performing efficient transaction. It lessens the processing
    time and cost in performing the transaction over the blockchain network. When
    miner node transmits new block to decentralized BC network, each member of BC
    consists of a choice to include block. Blockchain enhanced the interoperability,
    privacy, security and scalability during the data communication. A blockchain
    was combined with IoT and named as Blockchain of Things (BCoT). BCoT comprised
    of the following merits: The capability of communication with physical system
    and information exchange among the IoT systems is defined as Interoperability.
    Blockchain-composite layer constructed on P2P network with standard access among
    various IoT systems. Traceability of IoT data is potential of detecting and authenticating
    the spatial and temporal data of data block. In blockchain, each data block comprises
    historic timestamp. The data quality being trustworthy is defined as reliability
    of IoT data. It is guaranteed through integrity by cryptographic mechanism with
    asymmetric encryption methods, hash functions and digital signature. Autonomic
    interaction of IoT system characterized the potential of IoT system cooperating
    with each other without third party. The autonomy is attained through smart contracts
    allowed through the blockchains. The contract clauses in smart contracts get implemented
    when condition is satisfied. Blockchain is not same as distributed systems depending
    on the consensus property. Trust-less: The network entities are indefinite to
    other. They converse, assist and team up with others devoid of deliberating them.
    No specialized digital identity is necessitated to carry out transaction between
    entities. Permission-less: Restriction is not provided for functioning within
    the network. Censorship resistant: Any persons interact with others on blockchain.
    The confirmed transaction is not modified. Blockchain technology included four
    components: Consensus: Proof-of-Work protocol verifies every action in network
    for avoiding single miner node from managing blockchain network and for manipulating
    the transaction history. Ledger: It is shared and distributed database with information
    about all transactions performed within the network. It is undeniable through
    nature where information once stored is not deleted. It guarantees that every
    transaction is verified and accepted as valid one though many clients at particular
    time. Cryptography: It guaranteed that all network data is secured with the strong
    cryptographic encryption. It allowed the authorized users to decrypt existing
    information. Smart Contract: It is employed to validate and verify the network
    participants. Blockchain are categorized depending on managed data, availability
    and access control. Figure 2 describes the architecture diagram of blockchain
    in 6G. Every challenge is clearly described below. FIGURE 2. Architecture diagram
    of Blockchain in 6G. Show All 1) Massive Connectivity in Future Systems a: Scalability
    Number of devices linked and functioned in future industrial ecosystems are forecasted
    by industrial IoT enthusiast with the concepts of massive Machine Type Communications
    (mMTC). Adaption of 6G systems for unprecedented traffic demand remains as a challenging
    one. Real-time communication is established with less latency. The real-time communication
    acts as an essential need in the upcoming computing ecosystems. A higher accuracy
    with zero delay is achieved by D2D and M2M communication for precise operation.
    AR helped healthcare systems perform delay communication in huge-scale data exchange.
    b: Higher Throughput The decisive systems applied 5G communication ecosystems
    for providing concurrent connectivity to number of devices. The network organization
    like base station managed the large number of real time transactions. c: Synchronization
    Synchronization acts as a significant requirement in time vital industrial applications.
    Efficient operation is attained by the mission critical backbone systems with
    power allocation systems and vehicular networks harmonized in real time application.
    2) Security Requirements in Future Computing Ecosystems a: Confidentiality and
    Integrity The future computing infrastructure portrayed enormous threat surfaces
    with wireless connectivity. The encryption methods are lightweight for minimum
    powered IoT devices. Due to computational restraints, Lightweight cryptographic
    methods interpret the data into privacy risks. The huge volume of data formed
    by future systems is required to be accessed and adapted by the legal users during
    transmission. The eavesdropping and adaptation of data in transmission altered
    the system operation from expected performance. b: Availability The service accessibility
    is the significant requirement in upcoming networks. The superiority of 6G ecosystems
    with huge volume of interrelated devices prolonged the risk of DDoS attacks. c:
    Authentication and Access Control The federal authentication and access control
    methods get restrain in huge volume futuristic demands forecasted in 6G. The sophisticated
    access control required to equal the diversification of future tenants in 6G ecosystem
    are resource-intensive and origins bottlenecks in associated services. d: Audit
    An audit is required to assess the compliance of tenant actions in network ecosystem.
    Deep packet level audit identifies and flag the tenant behavior for superior security
    principles. Huge number of tenants auditing remains as a challenging one in security
    perspective. 3) Higher Data Consumption in Sophisticated Solutions The higher
    data rate is an essential prospect in future network ecosystems. The applications
    like VR, holographic communications, video and 3D ultra-video necessitated enhanced
    data rate and data utilization. 4) Device Resource Restrictions The computational
    and storage limitations are detected to restrict the abilities of cryptographic
    methods and caused variation from standard mechanisms. The standard implementation
    of security is harder with the device resource restrictions. B. Blockchain Benefits
    for 6G Blockchain is an essential technology to allow the potential of 6G systems
    and address the existing potential demands. Intelligent resource management: The
    network resource organization is a challenging one in huge connectivity demands
    of upcoming telecommunication ecosystems. The resource management functions such
    as spectrum allocation, orchestration and decentralized evaluation are compatible
    with the huge infrastructure. Intelligent network framework is applied with the
    blockchain technology by managing the association among operators and users. Based
    on game theory, the authors implemented an unlicensed spectrum sharing method.
    The blockchain and deep reinforcement learning was performed to carry out the
    resource management services with spectrum allocation and energy organization.
    1) Elevated Security Features a: Privacy The privacy is significant in security
    characteristic. Data privacy application is varied in complex security necessities
    for 6G network ecosystem. A privacy preserved approach was implemented based on
    blockchain for content-centric 6G networks. b: Authentication and Access Control
    Access control of centralized systems experienced scalability constraints. The
    access control with centralization remains as an essential demand in the future
    networks. A verification and access control approach depended on blockchain was
    implemented for cloud radio over the fiber network in 6G. c: Accountability The
    accountability of 6G beyond the network ecosystem is an important requirement.
    The blockchain and dispersed ledger technology applied security, inspection and
    authority of network. SECTION III. Integration of IoT in Blockchain An IoT is
    a diverse available manual method into digitalized description through processing
    large amount of data. The large data is employed for increasing the quality of
    life during digitalization process. The development in cloud computing was used
    for IoT with essential functions. IoT development has new possibility to attain
    and allocate the data. There is no confidence among the public because they not
    have clear idea of used data. It makes the developments to IoT through trusted
    sharing service distribution. The data source is identified at any time and improved
    the security level. The security is an essential requirement to guarantee that
    data get shared between available users. A breach in data resulted in the loss
    of private records and sensitive data. IoT represent network of many electronic
    devices to communicate with others through open channel. The connection was carried
    out through wireless technology such as sensor networks, field communication,
    etc. IoT adjusted the ubiquitous computing with several industrial applications.
    Security: When linked device count of network increases, the vulnerability development
    through external attacks also enhances because of minimum standard device application.
    Privacy: The data gathered is broadcasted from IoT devices to cloud storage for
    processing with third party. The data allocation without the user authority creates
    data leaks. Standards: Lack of regulations resulted in undesirable results while
    organizing the constituted devices. Latency: The communication principles for
    various IoT devices caused latency problems. IoT-enabled devices supported the
    data transmission at higher bandwidth. The devices handled the variations in the
    configuration like higher bandwidth capacity, increased data-rate and minimal
    latency. SECTION IV. Research Challenges of Blockchain With IoT Enabled 6G Devices
    An IoT and blockchain has large concern from the academic circles and industry.
    Bitcoin-style blockchain depend on PoW designs with features for many IoT scenarios.
    With fast development in IoT devices, energy needs are limited. The existing client/server
    systems are replaced by Blockchain. Information accumulated in nodes is termed
    as IoT devices. The devices comprise of less computational power and storage capacity
    to resolve the big hurdle in technology adoption. The research challenges of blockchain
    with IoT enabled 6G devices are described in Figure 3. FIGURE 3. Research challenges.
    Show All Blockchain gets increased when nodes count in the network increases.
    There is no equivalence and interoperability where various ledgers not converse
    with others. The stakeholders are essential one to attain complete interoperability.
    It required international strategies for collective trust and information security.
    The firm business cases are not carried out due to the uncertainties. The people
    are in quandary state of acceptance for industries. It connects different stakeholders
    in regions without legal compliance. It is demanding for service providers and
    productions to accept blockchain in diverse business cases. IoT devices are upgraded
    to the compatible one with high speed network connectivity. SECTION V. Blockchain
    and IoT Integration Solutions IoT designers had chosen the appropriate solution
    depending on restrictions and needs. There is no comprehensive analysis and resolutions
    for IoT manufacturers to attain the appropriate Blockchain platform for integrations.
    IoT devices required Blockchain to accumulate the state, handle multiple writers
    and avoid hiring the trusted third party. Block time and transactions per second
    (TPS) is taken depending on the importance for IoT devices to select the appropriate
    platform. IoT application has enough knowledge regarding the restrictions and
    needs like time-sensitivity, transactions and resources. The awareness assisted
    the IoT devices to describe the proper platform. Scalability, security, privacy
    and smart capability are the additional metrics that must be satisfied before
    implementation on IoT devices. A powerful decentralized network was constructed
    with developer tools for smart contracts, security and contract execution with
    high level of reliability. With advanced applications to enhance the superiority
    of citizen life, IoT acts essential in-service digitization. The access points
    were used to access and distribute the network information. Centralized data storage
    systems have contributed for development of IoT. A centralized structure not presented
    the data transparency. Blockchain technology is an essential resolution to increase
    the security and privacy. Blockchain can reform the IoT with open, dependence
    and auditable sharing platform. Figure 4 described the blockchain with 6G-enabled
    IoT for industrial application. FIGURE 4. Benefits of blockchain with 6G-enabled
    IoT for industrial automation. Show All Decentralization and Scalability: Paradigm
    shift from the centralized to decentralize for eliminating failure to increase
    the fault tolerance performance. It restricted the oligarchy of resources where
    corporations manage gathering and processing of data. Identity: The common blockchain
    carried out better identification of every device. The authentication of IoT devices
    is not provided. Autonomy: The mobile devices cooperate with each other by means
    of blockchain to implement the IoT-based industrial applications. Security: Information
    exchanges are considered as transactions using new agreements to provide the protected
    inter-device communication. Reliability: The incorporation allowed the users for
    validating the legitimacy of transaction with confidence and responsibility. Secure
    code deployment: A manufacturer traced the revise history and allowed them to
    update IoT devices securely. SECTION VI. Applications of Blockchain of Things
    With 6G A categorization of blockchain- industrial applications in 6G-enabled
    IoT is described. It comprised conventional sectors of interest for different
    purposes like smart manufacturing, supply chain management, food industry, smart
    grid, healthcare, multimedia and digital right management, agriculture and internet
    of vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Blockchain and 6G increased the security
    as well as bandwidth with minimal operational and capital expenditure. The blockchain
    application for 6G-enabled IoT is described in above Figure 5. The detailed description
    is given in next subsections. FIGURE 5. Applications of Blockchain for 6G-enabled
    IoT. Show All A. Smart Manufacturing The manufacturing industry gets upgraded
    from the automatic to smart technology. Large amount of data is created in each
    lifecycle phase with product designing, allocation, sell and service. The data
    get partitioned and resulted in data collection difficulty and data analytics.
    IoT systems are linked through P2P network for performing the data sharing in
    industrial sectors and interoperability issues are resolved. BCoT enhanced the
    security of smart manufacturing. B. Supply Chain Management A cluster of persons,
    sources and actions in product lifecycle is termed as Supply chain. It initiates
    from the creation process to sale process starting at supplier to manufacturer.
    The supply chain starts with supplier followed by producer, trader, seller and
    customer as shown in Figure 6. FIGURE 6. Usual flows in supply chain. Show All
    The process to handle the data and finances when they change by supply chain process
    is defined as Supply Chain Management (SCM). A product comprised multiple parts
    presented through different manufacturers across the countries. It is expensive
    for applying anti-fraud technologies in each product. During blockchain and IoT
    combination, every part linked with new ID. An immutable timestamp gets connected
    with ID. The recognition of each part recorded into blockchain that are tamper-resistant
    and perceptible. Traceability ontology was introduced with IoT and blockchain
    technologies depending on the Ethereum blockchain policy to guarantee the data
    provenance. BCoT minimized the costs in services. The blockchain and IoT integration
    minimized the cost and risk with high speed. Secured data sharing is attained
    among different endeavors to improve the customer service by blockchain based
    machine learning platform. C. Food Industry BCoT enhanced the product life cycle
    in food industry. The traceability of food products acts essential for assuring
    the food safety. It is a demanding one to guarantee food traceability for IoT.
    A food company included several of suppliers. The traceability required raw material
    data from sources for food manufacturing. Blockchain assured the traceability
    and food industry data origin. RFID and blockchain is employed for launching the
    supply chain platform from farming for food manufacture in China. The system guaranteed
    food supply-chain data traceability. Blockchain technology increased the food
    safety through provision of traceable food products. The combination of blockchain
    allowed the customers to track food production. Depending on blockchain and IoT
    tags, a food safety traceability system was introduced. The designed system prevented
    the data corruption and privacy revelation through smart contracts. D. Smart Grid
    The distributed renewable energy resources appearance alters with energy consumers
    from pure shoppers to prosumers. Energy prosumers with additional energy trade
    it to additional consumers. P2P energy trading is the energy between prosumer
    and consumer. It is a demanding one to ensure the secured energy dealing in distributed
    atmosphere. The blockchain technology provided opportunities to guarantee the
    secured P2P energy trading. An energy trading system was introduced depending
    on consortium blockchains to save cost without broker through blockchains consensus.
    A decentralized energy-trading system was introduced depending on blockchain for
    preserving the confidential transaction in smart grid. E. Healthcare Healthcare
    is one of the most important social-economic issues because of population. It
    included the new demands in healthcare services due to inadequate hospitals. The
    development in wearable healthcare devices provided healthcare data bring opportunities
    for providing the remote monitoring services at home. The wearable devices determine
    and gather the health-care data with heartbeat, diabetes and pressure investigation.
    With the aid of networks, Doctors access the health-care data at anytime and anywhere.
    The vulnerability of healthcare devices has many challenges in privacy preservation
    with higher data security. The blockchains were integrated into healthcare networks
    to address the privacy protection of health-care data. The blockchain technology
    preserved healthcare data stored in cloud servers. The health-care data collected
    through medical sensors and transmitted to system for patient monitoring. The
    privacy preservation is carried out in efficient manner. Blockchain was employed
    to manage the individual healthcare data and to support the data-sharing. Blockchain
    system ensured the privacy and security of healthcare data. An attribute-based
    signature method was introduced in healthcare blockchain systems. The designed
    scheme verified the legitimacy of health-care data and recognition of health-care
    data owner. Attribute-based signature method improved the privacy level of data
    owner in healthcare applications. F. Internet of Vehicles and Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles Internet of vehicles (IoV) integrated vehicle to-vehicle networks, vehicle-to-roadside
    networks, vehicle-to infrastructure networks and vehicle-to-pedestrian networks.
    The blockchain is integrated with IoV to address the security problems. A trust-management
    policy was used on blockchains in IoV. Their liability of messages gets authorized
    through PoW/PoS consensus implemented through RSUs. Blockchain technologies employed
    to conserve the energy and data communication among electric vehicles and hybrid
    electric vehicles in smart grids. G. Agriculture Smart agriculture employed the
    new technologies like IoT, GPS and Bigdata for increasing the quantity of agricultural
    products. Information are stored in control system and examined by AI. The combination
    of information technologies in smart agriculture makes agricultural supply chain
    as cost-effective. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) enhanced the effectiveness,
    traceability and simplicity in agricultural supply chains. For avoiding the redundant
    difficulties to accumulate data on blockchain, two associated structure must be
    designed. Basic Planting Information: Information regarding specific process of
    supply chain like production and accumulation is gathered. Provenance Record:
    Information regarding agricultural operation is stored. H. Multimedia and Digital
    Right Management Media distribution is a category of digital multimedia contents
    allocation like audio, image and video. The merits of conventional online content
    delivery medium incorporated enhanced accessibility, cost and higher performance.
    Due to minimal housing cost, cloud-based Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are
    chosen. The designed systems included the inherent problems that are not easy
    to resolve. Blockchain-based RIGHTs management system (BRIGHT) aimed on video
    files of blockchain. The existing multimedia failed to conserve any data with
    respect to ownership or media adaptation records. The original media are tampered
    for particular purposes to widen the false information over the social media.
    The watermark comprised information about two characteristics: Image Hash: It
    is applied for securing the original media content to get regained when required.
    Cryptographic Hash: It comprised transaction record that represents any alteration
    types to the original media. SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Scope With fast
    development in number of connected IoT device, many obstacles occur to minimize
    the adoption of IoT across different applications. There are many concerns about
    the interoperability as solutions implemented create the new data silos. The centralized
    architecture of IoT solution needs the IoT device owners to trust the organizations
    to maintain the data safe. Blockchain is a promising technology that helped with
    IoT systems resiliency. A distributed ledger avoided centralized architecture
    challenges and stores data through its characteristics. Blockchain construct the
    trust between IoT devices and minimized risk of tampering with Blockchain cryptography.
    It minimized the cost through eliminating the middlemen and intermediary’s overhead.
    Blockchain provide solution to address many IoT challenges but any convergence
    between two embedded technologies creates new issues and obstacles. The characteristic
    of Blockchain gets changed because of IoT requirements like security, data privacy,
    consensus protocol and smart contracts. Several research papers on Blockchain
    integration with IoT are reviewed to examine the security issues. From this survey,
    it is found that the blockchain technology developed for IoT network fails in
    performance due to more energy consumption, execution time and communication overhead.
    In some existing works, the data confidentiality and integrity level also remain
    low. The research challenges and open issues in incorporation of blockchain with
    6G communication network are analyzed. Then, the future research guidelines toward
    blockchain enabled IoT with 6G communication is provided. The future scope of
    this article is to integrate the blockchain with IoT 6G technologies for reducing
    the computational cost. Security and privacy issues of 5G technologies are to
    be reduced depending on demands and requirements. Authors Figures References Citations

    Groundbreakingly, blockchain technology (BCT) has gained widespread acceptance
    and importance in the last few years. Implemented in different areas of applications
    such as social and legal industries, finance, smart property, and supply chain
    networks. This technology assures immutability and integrity of data without the
    need of a third trusted party. Furthermore, BCT could guarantee a transparent
    and decentralized transaction system in businesses and industries. Even though
    general research has been done in the BCT, however, there is a lack of systematic
    analysis on current research challenges regarding how BCT is effectively applicable
    in supply chain management (SCM). A systematic literature review (SLR) of SCM
    based on blockchain does not exist yet. This work aims to explore and analyse
    the state-ofthe-art on the BCT applications for SCM. We synthesize existing evidence,
    and identify gaps, available in the literature. The survey uses a systematic mapping
    study (SMS) method to examine 40 extracted primary studies from scientific databases.

    Abstract: Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and\
    \ autonomous local\nstakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple\
    \ participants linked by complicated\ninteractions, impacting the production,\
    \ processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end\nconsumers. Regular\
    \ instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply\n\
    chains, raising worries about ﬁnancial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering\
    \ corporate brand\nvalue. To develop an efﬁcient and reliable trading environment,\
    \ several fundamental modiﬁcations\nin the present supply chain architecture are\
    \ required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can\nimprove transparency\
    \ in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand\nsafe,\
    \ sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using\
    \ blockchains\nand the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness\
    \ in agri-food SCs,\nnew concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various\
    \ Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g.,\nblockchain technology, big data, internet\
    \ of things (IoT), radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), near\nﬁeld communication\
    \ (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology’s\n\
    limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in\
    \ agri-food supply chains.\nThis study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply\
    \ Chain Management using Blockchain and\nInternet of things) architecture to address\
    \ the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability,\nsecurity and privacy\

    \ or dissected and mixed across the supply chain, one up/one down\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 40\n3 of 25\ntraceability can be easily lost (e.g., animals for meat\
    \ production). With this level of intricacy,\nverifying the provenance and quality\
    \ requirements of individual items becomes nearly\ndifﬁcult. Furthermore, the\
    \ food sector continues to rely heavily on paper records, and the\npresent food\
    \ traceability systems are not integrated nor linked across all participants in\
    \ the\nsupply chain. This isolation creates a negative information imbalance among\
    \ all supply\nchain stakeholders, a lack of transparency across numerous supply\
    \ chain processes, and\nthe potential for fraud to be promoted or concealed. Although\
    \ several technologies for\nproduct traceability have previously been employed,\
    \ such as bar codes, RFID tags, and\nElectronic Data Interchange (EDI), Bosnia\
    \ and Gebresenbet [4] stated that more technical\napplications for food supply\
    \ chain traceability are needed.\nMoreover, existing IoT-based tracking and provenance\
    \ systems for agri-supply chains\nare layered on top of centralized structures,\
    \ leaving an opportunity for unresolved issues\nand key concerns such as data\
    \ integrity, manipulation, and single points of failure. In\nreality, obtaining\
    \ veriﬁed and conﬁdential data in a supply chain is difﬁcult because it\nnecessitates\
    \ a high degree of conﬁdence between cooperating parties, and trust necessitates\n\
    the development of a speciﬁc quantity of veriﬁed and communicated information\
    \ [5].\nAlthough scholars and practitioners believe that somehow a third party\
    \ is required in the\nchain to ensure information quality and security, the incentive\
    \ for supply chain stakeholders\nto increase transparency in the agri-supply chain\
    \ varies [6]. In this way, blockchain may\noperate as a decentralized certiﬁcate\
    \ authority, verifying transactions, and delivering\ntamper-proof cryptographic\
    \ information to any point in the chain upon demand.\nGlobally known food companies\
    \ have begun to collaborate to accelerate the imple-\nmentation of distributed\
    \ ledger technology in agri-food supply chains, and early prototype\nmodels are\
    \ emerging. Novel design concepts for such a system have been offered in the\n\

    \ the\nimplementation of distributed ledger technology in agri-food supply chains,\
    \ and early\nprototype models are emerging. Novel design concepts for such a system\
    \ have been offered\nin the literature. In this context, researchers have begun\
    \ to implement blockchain-enabled\nsupply chain product traceability models [7–12],\
    \ however, preliminary ﬁndings are only\naccessible for latency, network trafﬁc,\
    \ and CPU load. Tian [13] has recently expanded the\ninitial application to real-time\
    \ food monitoring based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and\nCritical Control Points),\
    \ however widespread adoption of blockchain technology in the\nfood processing\
    \ sector and supply chain is difﬁcult and may face several problems [9].\nOn the\
    \ other hand, by far most of the existing logistic information systems in Agri-Food\n\
    supply chains like Costco, Walmart, Cargill, Albert Heijn, etc., just store, track\
    \ orders, and\nsupplies, without giving characteristics such as transparency,\
    \ auditability, and traceability.\nThese characteristics in an agri-food supply\
    \ chain will certainly improve the food quality\nand safety, thus are in demand\
    \ from consumers. Therefore, numerous R&D communities\nboth in industries and\
    \ academia have engaged their efforts in developing efﬁcient food\nchain traceability\
    \ systems based on emerging technologies like the IoT and blockchain\ntechnologies,\
    \ to facilitate remote monitoring at every stage all along the supply chain, from\n\
    farm to fork. The above-mentioned companies have recently started experiments\
    \ with\nblockchain for their supply chains.\nThe contributions of this paper can\
    \ be summarized as: (i) we performed a comprehen-\nsive study of the state-of-art\
    \ of IoT and blockchain technologies in agri-food supply chain\nand highlighted\
    \ the prospective applications of these technologies, (ii) we identiﬁed and\n\
    provided a comprehensive discussion on different research challenges of agriculture\

    \ also given the special consideration to security and\nimplementation challenges\
    \ of these technologies and smart contracts in blockchain-based\nagriculture sector,\
    \ and (v) ﬁnally, we introduced a new blockchain-based Agri-SCM-IoT\narchitecture\
    \ to solve storage, security, and some other challenges in the agriculture supply\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 40\n4 of 25\nchain along with the necessity of interoperability\
    \ among blockchain platforms to solve\nscalability and growing blockchain ledger\
    \ size. Though there are several reviews [14–18]\nthat focus on IoT and blockchain-based\
    \ food supply chain management, to the best of\nour knowledge, no work has discussed\
    \ the interoperability between different blockchain\nplatforms and the ever-increasing\
    \ nature of ledge size affecting the scalability of the single-\nchain based supply\
    \ chain systems. This work presents a systematic literature review of\nblockchain,\
    \ IoT, and AI technologies in agri-supply chain applications contributing to the\n\
    existing literature of these three technologies by identifying the singularity\
    \ of individual\ntechnological usage and accumulating a thorough understanding\
    \ of the relationship among\nthese technologies. Moreover, we exhibit the potential\
    \ research directions to conduct\ncomparative examinations of these technologies\
    \ in agri-supply chain management and\ninvestigate interactive factors reported\
    \ in the existing literature. This paper covers both\ntechnical and applicative\
    \ characteristics in such a way that our intuitions can be applied\nfor cross-blockchain\
    \ agri-supply chain scenarios.\n2. Related Work\nTo effectively manage the supply\
    \ chain, and thus the human behaviors it includes,\nall stakeholders must agree\
    \ on the information to be recorded on the blockchain, from\nraw materials to\
    \ ﬁnished goods. The fundamental objective is to choose the information\nthat\
    \ is useful to all areas of the supply chain, with a particular focus on customer\
    \ needs\nand applicable standards blockchain may be utilized as a marketing technique\
    \ along with\noperating as a traceability system. Blockchains may be used to improve\
    \ a company’s image\nand reputation [19], promote loyalty among existing consumers\
    \ [20], and bring new clients\nsince they are entirely transparent [21] and participants\
    \ can manage the items in them. In\nreality, organizations may simply set themselves\
    \ apart from rivals by stressing product ﬂow\ntransparency and monitoring across\
    \ the supply chain. Furthermore, quickly identifying a\nsource of food contamination\
    \ can boost a company’s brand image [22] and mitigate the\nnegative impact of\
    \ media criticism. With the globalization of business, supply chains are\ngrowing\
    \ more complicated, making it more difﬁcult to track things across their intricate\n\
    webs. In reality, stakeholder relationships are frequently complicated. As a result,\
    \ suppliers\ncan be divided into tiers, with a ﬁrst-tier supplier supplying the\
    \ organization directly with\nmetal cans, for example, and a second-tier supplier\
    \ supplying the raw materials needed to\nmanufacture the cans [23]. Organizations\
    \ sometimes have several suppliers at various levels\ninvolved in a single product;\
    \ also, suppliers are frequently non-exclusive to a single ﬁrm.\nAung and Chang\
    \ [24], as well as Golan [25], have identiﬁed three key goals for traceability\n\
    to enhance product-supply chain administration, product differentiation strategies,\
    \ and\nquality assurance, and improved detection of non-compliant items. Compliance\
    \ with\napplicable legislation and standards is another factor in ensuring traceability.\n\
    Majority of existing blockchain solutions for traceability management have been\
    \ es-\ntablished based on single chain architecture such as the Fish supply chain\
    \ [26] to decrease\nthe transaction cost and enhance the transaction capacity\
    \ and make system auditable and\nprovide certiﬁcations to the product, Wine supply\
    \ chain [27] to improve the performance,\nrevenue, accountability, and security,\
    \ and implement the more secure and secure global\ntransactions, Agri-food supply\
    \ chain [28] to enable quality and certiﬁed virtual identity\nespecially for “bio”\
    \ and DOCG products, Agri-food supply chain system [29] to share the\nauthentic\
    \ data in production, processing, distribution, retailer, etc. across the supply\
    \ chain,\nFruit supply chain based on public immutable distributed ledger based\
    \ on decreased vari-\nance of mining rewards, Pork supply chain [30] to enhance\
    \ consumer trust by protecting\nthe brand and security through transparency, large\
    \ enterprises supply chain food tracking\nproject [31] to integrate the existing\
    \ systems with the blockchain used by various stakehold-\ners, fresh food [32]\
    \ supply chain to attach the product origin data along with sensor data\nthroughout\
    \ the supply chain with product to enable data, and product transfer transparent\n\
    from farm to fork. Furthermore, the AgriOpenData [28] blockchain integrated solution\
    \ is a\ncutting-edge digital technology that ensures transparent, secure, and\
    \ public transparency\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 40\n5 of 25\nthroughout the whole\
    \ agriculture supply chain and in the processing of agricultural goods.\nThis\
    \ is especially true for “bio” and DOCG (Designation of Origin Controlled and\
    \ Guaran-\nteed) items, which may have their quality and virtual identity certiﬁed\
    \ (viz., provenance,\nownership, seeding, treatments, crop, Internet of Things\
    \ analysis, processing, storage, and\ndelivery). This digitized history of organically\
    \ cultivated products ensures end-consumer\nlegitimacy and improves the agri-food\
    \ industry’s quality. The variation of mining incen-\ntives, and thus the necessity\
    \ for mining pools, maybe signiﬁcantly minimized using some\nparticular FruitChain\
    \ protocols [33]. For example, in a FruitChain with 1000 fruits per\nblock and\
    \ each fruit taking 80 bytes, allocating memory for 1000 fruits every block occupies\n\
    around 8% of a 1 MN block. A solitary miner may now get their initial rewards\
    \ 1000 times\nquicker (in a day or several rather than a few years).\nFurthermore,\
    \ DNA samples from an animal may be used to determine its breed, but\nadditional\
    \ data such as country of origin, toxicity exposure, and uncontrolled medicine,\n\
    among other critical factors, can be acquired. To ensure the animal’s identity\
    \ and lifetime,\nthis data may be compared to the blockchain record. Dey et al.\
    \ [12] developed a Food-\nSQRBlock (Food Safety Quick Response Block) supply chain\
    \ architecture using blockchain\nand QR codes. They have also proposed large-scale\
    \ cloud integration of the developed\nsystem to demonstrate the framework’s practicality\
    \ and scalability, as well as an exper-\nimental assessment to back it up. Tian\
    \ et al. [13] proposed a theoretical real-time food\ntraceability system using\
    \ HACCP, blockchain, and IoT. The authors have claimed to achieve\ntransparency,\
    \ reliability, and security with the proposed model but have not provided any\n\
    experimental implementation and evaluation of the system. Leng et al. [9] introduced\n\
    a double chain-based agriculture supply chain architecture using a public blockchain.\n\
    They also study the storage mode, resource rent-seeking, and consensus algorithms\
    \ but\nhave not evaluated the speed and competence of consensus algorithms by\
    \ considering\nthe case for a huge number of nodes and resources on the platform.\
    \ Moreover, the access\nmanagement for the user needs to be further investigated.\
    \ Surasak et al. [10] presented\nan IoT-based blockchain traceability system particularly\
    \ designed for Thai agriculture\nproducts. Blockchain has been used for creating\
    \ a distributed ledger to increase data\nintegrity and transparency and a structured\
    \ query language (SQL) database has been used\nto make the platform user-friendly.\
    \ There is a need to further research on the integration of\nblockchain with the\
    \ proposed system to enhance the security, transparency, and integrity\nof the\
    \ system. Dakshayini et al. [34] suggested a blockchain, big data, and cloud-integrated\n\
    crop supervision system trying to realize effective demand-based decision support\
    \ and to\nachieve a simple, auditable, and secure supply chain. The authors have\
    \ also proposed a\ncrop-trading platform to sell the agri-products at different\
    \ stages. However, they have not\nimplemented the IoT-based Blockchain architecture\
    \ to gather the real data from the ﬁeld\nparameters and then model the big data-based\
    \ decision support system. They have just\nused the available data set and implemented\
    \ a deep learning model to predict the demand.\n3. Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts\
    \ in Agri-Supply Chain Management\nAgri-food supply chain system comprises multiple\
    \ levels of transactions, each level\nwith different terms and conditions [35].\
    \ Different systems with diverse characteristics and\nfunctions have collaborated\
    \ in a supply chain, including food processing, transportation,\nstorage, and\
    \ distributors. All these levels maintain a record of all the products from pro-\n\
    cessing to packaging, transportation to storage, and distribution, which are very\
    \ long and\ncomplex processes. Smart contracts can assist in simplifying the whole\
    \ process and enhance\ntransparency throughout the supply chain. Integrating blockchain-based\
    \ smart contracts\nwith IoT devices enables tracking of the location of goods,\
    \ allows tracking of inventory, and\nthe change of ownership rights across the\
    \ supply chain. This helps companies to prepare\nwell for any disruption or incidents.\
    \ Besides this, smart contracts enable companies and\ncustomers to determine the\
    \ quality of the food products by tracing back all the information.\nThe characteristics\
    \ of smart contracts [36] enable their use in diverse applications or do-\nmains.\
    \ Several of such characteristics are acquired from the core blockchain technology.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 40\n6 of 25\nTable 1. shows the categorization of the key\
    \ characteristics of smart contact characteris-\ntics. Figure 2. represents the\
    \ typical structure of blockchain smart contract system having\nvarious functional\
    \ blocks like user management and service management modules man-\nages the user\
    \ accounts, services, and smart contracts, business network module agent,\nAPI’s\
    \ are used to provide an interface for external components, and virtual blockchain\n\
    platform (such as Ethereum virtual machine) is used to deploy, implement, and\
    \ supervise\nthe smart contract state machine, etc., in the contract run time\
    \ once all parties have signed\nthe contract. The smart contract terms and conditions\
    \ of the smart contract are enforced\ndynamically depending on the real-time data\
    \ from various distributed sources and the\nbusiness transactions are secured\
    \ by blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.\nTable 1. Characteristics\
    \ of Blockchain-based Smart Contracts.\nFeatures\nDescription\nElimination of\
    \ centralized authority\nSince blockchain operates in decentralized mode with\
    \ every node in the network, a\nsmart contract allows autonomous execution according\
    \ to predeﬁned provisions. Thus\ndecentralization of the system maintains ceaseless\
    \ service availability by eliminating\nthe single point of failure, reduces data\
    \ usage and latency, and ensures accountability.\nForge Resistance\nSmart contracts\
    \ preserve the integrity of the distributed ledger and computational\nlogic is\
    \ veriﬁed with digital signatures. The smart contracts once implemented cannot\n\
    be changed even by their owner.\nTransparency\nThe transaction data and smart\
    \ contract logic can be accessed by authenticated users\nall the time.\nSelf-execution\n\
    A business transaction between the entities within the network executes once\n\
    predeﬁned conditions and the ﬂow of events deﬁned in smart contracts are met\n\
    without any inference of a centralized third party.\nAccuracy\nSince the conditions\
    \ are programmed to be immutable and veriﬁed several times\nbefore deployment\
    \ on the blockchain nodes, the execution is automatic and guarantees\naccuracy\
    \ without any error on the execution. This feature removes the biased\noperation\
    \ and maintains trust between the entities through transparent execution.\nEvent-Driven\
    \ Program\nSome smart contracts are executed based on the event logs generated\
    \ within the\ncontext of a transaction predeﬁned in its code. These transaction\
    \ events are atomic i.e.,\neither happen completely or not at all.\nIn an IoT-based\
    \ supply chain, smart contracts with blockchain technology can be\nutilized to\
    \ enhance the security measures [37], to expedite data management, besides\nenabling\
    \ the communication of diverse nodes or devices in an interoperable way. In smart\n\
    contract-based security management [38], smart contracts can be used instead of\
    \ digital\ncertiﬁcates by including a list of several forms of identiﬁers or characteristics\
    \ linked with\nthe public key of the contract owner. Additionally, this list can\
    \ only be modiﬁed only by its\nowner, and additional security is guaranteed by\
    \ smart contact residing in the blockchain.\nThus, by implementing smart contracts\
    \ in blockchain eliminates the use of certiﬁcation\nauthorities. A blockchain-based\
    \ smart contract simpliﬁes the identity management of\nthe users by providing\
    \ a GUI (Graphical User Interface) [39] to each user having very\nlittle collision\
    \ probability. It also facilitates the traditional and novel security schemes\
    \ by\nstoring additional primitives including TLS (Transport Layer Security) [40]\
    \ public keys.\nBy keeping public keys in the blockchain, clients do not need\
    \ to count on pre-trusted\ncertiﬁcation authorities. Furthermore, due to the transparent\
    \ and distributed characteristics\nof blockchain, this method is more robust against\
    \ malicious authorities, in comparison to\nthe DNS-based Authentication of naming\
    \ entities (DANE) protocol [41], depending on the\ndomain name system (DNS). Smart\
    \ contracts and blockchain can expedite and develop\ndata management in several\
    \ ways including access control, information, functionality\nscoping (i.e., same\
    \ contract can be deployed by multiple users and each contract gets its\naddress\
    \ and execute independently), proof of ownership, data authentication, and non-\n\

    \ This supports entrepreneurial activity by\ndeploying extra conﬁdence inside\
    \ ﬁrm networks and supply chains [42].\nFurthermore, blockchains are often open\
    \ and transparent, allowing all supply chain\nplayers to view, update, and check\
    \ data, while modifying or deleting blockchain secured\ndata is practically hard,\
    \ resulting in increased transparency of all supply chain activities.\nAs a result,\
    \ supply chain providers may publicly advertise their availability to the whole\n\
    market, as well as the capacity they have, enhancing their market position and\
    \ increasing\ntheir independence from transportation brokers. This is an option\
    \ for smaller suppliers\nand SME participants in a supply chain to combine their\
    \ production outputs to fulﬁll large\norders, allowing them to sell products directly\
    \ to retailers or ultimate clients rather than\nthrough intermediaries. Wu et\
    \ al. [43] created a smart contract for logistics, demonstrating\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 40\n8 of 25\nhow contract digitalization can complement or replace\
    \ highly centralized fourth-party\nlogistics providers, reducing the layers of\
    \ intermediaries or businessmen within supply\nchains by directly connecting suppliers,\
    \ processors, retailers, distributors, and logistics\ncompanies. All of these\
    \ ideas are valid and adaptable to smart supply chains beyond\nrestrictions. Due\
    \ to the openness and transparency of blockchain-based supply chains,\ncross-enterprise\
    \ business processes may be improved and optimized. To oversee and\nimprove operations\
    \ management and supply chain activities, Nyhuis and Wiendahl [44]\nintroduced\
    \ logistic operation curve theory and throughput-oriented lot sizing. However,\n\
    empirical ﬁndings show that these theoretical notions do not operate effectively\
    \ in practice,\nnecessitating a revision of the underlying theoretical models\
    \ [45]. Smart contracts may\nbe used to start transactions amongst supply chain\
    \ units to coordinate and optimize the\nwhole supply chain. This applies to time-related\
    \ issues such as throughput, cycle, and lead\ntime, as well as cash ﬂows along\
    \ the supply chain. So, based on the ﬁndings, the most\npromising use of blockchain\
    \ technology and smart contracts in the agri-culture supply\nchain network is\
    \ reorganization of the agriculture product trading market by implementing\ncross-blockchain\
    \ (cross-enterprise) asset and data transfer.\n4. Application of Integrating Blockchain\
    \ and IoT with Agri-Supply Chain\nTo establish an efﬁcient and reliable supply\
    \ chain management system, the industry\nneeds to employ cutting-edge technologies\
    \ like blockchain, IoT, and AI. A data-driven\nsmart agriculture supply chain\
    \ with AI, IoT, and blockchain is the most promising approach\nto solve different\
    \ existing problems. If we could generate a huge quantity of data from the\nsupply\
    \ chain and use that data to drive the decision processes. It can help to solve\
    \ several\nproblems related to food quality, safety, foodborne, data sharing across\
    \ the supply chain,\netc., globally. Some of the potential applications of blockchain,\
    \ AI, and IoT in supply chain\nmanagement are discussed.\n4.1. Food Composition,\
    \ Quality, and Safety Monitoring\nRecently consumers are increasingly being made\
    \ aware of the composition and quality\nof food products [46] through different\
    \ awareness programs regarding healthy lifestyles\nand technological advancements\
    \ in food science. Furthermore, due to new food regula-\ntions around the world\
    \ companies need to label food products in detail alongside quality\nmonitoring.\
    \ Labeling guidelines [24] perform a pivotal part in ﬁnding out which scien-\n\
    tiﬁc tests are suitable for a speciﬁc issue. Consumers around the globe are progressively\n\
    requesting a guarantee that the origin and ingredients of their food follow the\
    \ data on the\nlabel. This is the reason shoppers, producers, and administrative\
    \ bodies have perceived the\nauthenticity of food items as signiﬁcant quality\
    \ standards. Thus different IoT sensors based\non UV-Visible-near infrared spectroscopy\
    \ [47], DNA-PCR methods [48], stable isotope\nmeasurement (IRMS) [49], mass spectrometry\
    \ [50], separation techniques [51], and big\ndata are making a rapid advance in\
    \ food products quality, composition, and assessment\nﬁelds. Thus, the advancements\
    \ in the development of distributed ledger technology along\nwith IoT, big data,\
    \ and micro-fabrication, and miniaturization of spectroscopic devices.\nLargely,\
    \ UV-Visible-near infrared spectroscopy-based IoT, in association with blockchain\n\
    and big data analysis provides an indispensable and vigorous variety and authenticity\n\
    management mechanism for the smart agriculture area.\n4.2. Food Safety across\
    \ Supply Chain\nFor all stakeholders around the world, food safety has developed\
    \ as a global prior-\nity from farm to fork. There have been many foodborne outbreaks\
    \ [52] based on fresh\nagriculture products in the recent past. That results in\
    \ the dumping of a huge quantity of\nagri-produce to protect public health. It\
    \ is estimated that the food requirement around\nthe globe is anticipated to surge\
    \ by ﬁfty percent from 2020 to 2050, present practices of\nprotecting the health\
    \ of the masses by foodborne outbursts could be infeasible choices for\nthe future.\
    \ Every day an enormous amount of data is generated in the food industry and\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 40\n9 of 25\nrecognizing methods to abstract the vital material\
    \ from diverse sources would assist in bac-\nterial risk evaluation [53], outbreak\
    \ deterrence, classiﬁcation of trends utilizing pathogen\nsupervision [54], which\
    \ empowers food safety conclusions and supports decision making.\nConcurrent supervision\
    \ of agri-food products throughout repository and distribution [55],\nRFID tag,\
    \ GPS, and QR code like digital labeling that is not difﬁcult to synchronize with\n\
    the cloud, and improved traceability due to blockchain are a few out of numerous\
    \ beneﬁts\nthat ICT can add to the prospectus food safety. The potential of blockchain\
    \ and the internet\nof things to boost food reconnaissance frameworks are encouraging\
    \ and performing syn-\nergistically by integrating AI-based big data evaluation\
    \ like a prompt response towards\nfood safety outbursts [56,57]. It is expected\
    \ that the internet of things would be beneﬁcial\nto carry out a comprehensive\
    \ methodology in food handling in which key drivers like\nenvironmental change,\
    \ human conduct, and economy might be joined to visualize food\nsafety hazards\
    \ and blockchain will enhance the privacy and security of data.\n4.3. Food Product\
    \ Traceability\nThe traceability of food products has consistently been one of\
    \ the main concerns of\nthe customers. It is well-deﬁned as the capability of\
    \ a system to monitor and track the\nmovement of agricultural food products across\
    \ the supply chain from the producer to the\nﬁnal distribution stages [7,58].\
    \ Recently, with fast economic growth and the improved\nstandard of living, people\
    \ have started to pay more attention to the quality and nutritious\nvalues of\
    \ the food. However, various food safety crises are always there. Customers\n\
    from asymmetric information environments do not have access to the food supply\
    \ chain\ninformation, which results in high health risks. Tracking has emerged\
    \ as an essential service\nin the agri-food supply chain [13] to guarantee food\
    \ safety to customers. The incompetence\nof the food monitoring organizations\
    \ to isolate the source of adulteration in outbreaks break\nthe community trust\
    \ in the supply chain considerably. For instance, amid the Spinach ﬂare-\nup [59]\
    \ of 2006, it took fourteen days to identify the adulterant substance, and abundant\n\
    resources were utilized. A different case incorporates the romaine lettuce episode\
    \ [60]\nof 2018 during which all the lettuce was taken down the racks without\
    \ awareness of the\nbeginning of contamination. All available lettuce in markets\
    \ was dumped due to a lack\nof proper back-tracing mechanism by the food governing\
    \ organizations. The deﬁcient\nrecord-keeping methods usage result in the inability\
    \ of back-tracing of food products. This\ncauses degradation of purchaser trusts\
    \ and results in a critical setback for food producers.\nTo solve this problem,\
    \ blockchain innovation can be employed. Blockchain implementation\nwill empower\
    \ fast and exact back-tracing, decreasing expenses from food losses, and saving\n\
    valuable living souls [61]. Blockchain distributed ledger technology [62] could\
    \ be used\nin the food chain to store valuable information digitally such as food\
    \ production data,\ningredients, origin, shipment and storage data, expiry, etc.\
    \ This will facilitate the prompt\nidentiﬁcation of foodborne outbreaks and the\
    \ authenticity of the food.\nIn recent years, various solutions utilizing several\
    \ technologies such as IoT, RFID, AI, etc.\nhave been proposed to advance agricultural\
    \ food product traceability [7,8,10,12,13,17,29,62–64].\nFigure 3 below shows\
    \ an outline of how the product and data ﬂow in an IoT-based\nblockchain supply\
    \ chain system. The traceability system contains all the information\nabout food\
    \ production, processing, and transportation as well as storage conditions. The\n\
    consumer should be provided access to all the information about each step precisely\
    \ and\neven about every single ingredient of the ﬁnal product.\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 40\n10 of 25\n \n[7,8,10,12,13,17,29,62–64]. Figure 3 below shows an outline\
    \ of how the product and data \nflow in an IoT-based blockchain supply chain system.\
    \ The traceability system contains all \nthe information about food production,\
    \ processing, and transportation as well as storage \nconditions. The consumer\
    \ should be provided access to all the information about each \nstep precisely\
    \ and even about every single ingredient of the final product. \n \nFigure 3.\
    \ Blockchain-based smart agri-supply chain. \n4.4. Tackle Food Waste \nThere are\
    \ different stages such as harvesting, post-harvest management, and reposi-\n\
    tory, processing, distribution to markets and retailers, and consumption in the\
    \ food sup-\nply chain through that food traverses from farm production to arrive\
    \ at the consumer [65]. \nFood loss occurs at stages of post-harvesting (i.e.,\
    \ during post-harvest handling, storage, \npreparation, and distribution) and\
    \ processed stage (i.e., at the retailer operations or be-\nhavior of consumers).\
    \ Food waste also consists of losses during the pre-harvest session \ndue to pests\
    \ and diseases, or other issues like losses in fields due to extreme weather con-\n\
    ditions, not harvested due to price drops, etc. [66]. Food loss and waste at any\
    \ stage of the \nsupply chain create numerous challenges and waste opportunities\
    \ for growers, consum-\ners, and communities as a whole. Loss in produce causes\
    \ financial losses to farmers, short-\nages, and higher bills for customers. This\
    \ financial burden is particularly grave for people \non the food insecurity edge,\
    \ where a trivial swing in price can substantially impact liveli-\nhood. \nTechnology-based\
    \ like blockchain, IoT, and big data solutions are being employed to \nmanage\
    \ food waste, perhaps the most pervasive issues confronting the food sector [67].\
    \ \nAddressing this persistent problem has turned into an industry critical that\
    \ is being un-\ndertaken using different cutting-edge technologies to increase\
    \ shelf-life, dynamic price \nadjustment depending on sell-by-dates, and monitor\
    \ automatically food waste at restau-\nrants, retail stores, pre-harvest and post-harvest\
    \ losses, etc. In the food processing indus-\ntries, blockchain-based supply chains\
    \ are offering better transparency into food produc-\ntions. IoT device network\
    \ sends real-time data that can be utilized to optimize production \nprocesses\
    \ and enhance quality, making it simple to satisfy the consumer needs, tackle\
    \ the \nlogistic issues, and withhold government regulations. Blockchain and IoT\
    \ devices along \nwith big data can provide food companies [67] with effective\
    \ technological solutions to \nresolve challenging issues. \nFigure 3. Blockchain-based\
    \ smart agri-supply chain.\n4.4. Tackle Food Waste\nThere are different stages\
    \ such as harvesting, post-harvest management, and repository,\nprocessing, distribution\
    \ to markets and retailers, and consumption in the food supply\nchain through\
    \ that food traverses from farm production to arrive at the consumer [65].\nFood\
    \ loss occurs at stages of post-harvesting (i.e., during post-harvest handling,\
    \ storage,\npreparation, and distribution) and processed stage (i.e., at the retailer\
    \ operations or behavior\nof consumers). Food waste also consists of losses during\
    \ the pre-harvest session due to\npests and diseases, or other issues like losses\
    \ in ﬁelds due to extreme weather conditions,\nnot harvested due to price drops,\
    \ etc. [66]. Food loss and waste at any stage of the supply\nchain create numerous\
    \ challenges and waste opportunities for growers, consumers, and\ncommunities\
    \ as a whole. Loss in produce causes ﬁnancial losses to farmers, shortages, and\n\
    higher bills for customers. This ﬁnancial burden is particularly grave for people\
    \ on the\nfood insecurity edge, where a trivial swing in price can substantially\
    \ impact livelihood.\nTechnology-based like blockchain, IoT, and big data solutions\
    \ are being employed to\nmanage food waste, perhaps the most pervasive issues\
    \ confronting the food sector [67].\nAddressing this persistent problem has turned\
    \ into an industry critical that is being under-\ntaken using different cutting-edge\
    \ technologies to increase shelf-life, dynamic price adjust-\nment depending on\
    \ sell-by-dates, and monitor automatically food waste at restaurants,\nretail\
    \ stores, pre-harvest and post-harvest losses, etc. In the food processing industries,\n\
    blockchain-based supply chains are offering better transparency into food productions.\
    \ IoT\ndevice network sends real-time data that can be utilized to optimize production\
    \ processes\nand enhance quality, making it simple to satisfy the consumer needs,\
    \ tackle the logistic\nissues, and withhold government regulations. Blockchain\
    \ and IoT devices along with big\ndata can provide food companies [67] with effective\
    \ technological solutions to resolve\nchallenging issues.\n4.5. Inventory Management\n\
    Inventory management is described as the process of overseeing the movement of\n\
    goods from the production plant to warehouses and from these facilities to retail\
    \ outlets [68].\nIt is an important part of supply chain management. It is worth\
    \ noting that demand\nforecasting and inventory management are inextricably linked.\
    \ If the provider fails to\nsatisfy the needs of the customers, the company’s\
    \ time and money are wasted, and the\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 40\n11 of 25\ncustomers\
    \ are dissatisﬁed. Alternatively, if supply exceeds demand, vital resources are\n\
    depleted for no additional proﬁt since there are no possibilities to sell the\
    \ excess inventory.\nHigh inventory levels, according to several well-known business\
    \ gurus, are one of the\nkey concerns that restrict ﬁrms’ proﬁtability [69]. Furthermore,\
    \ as borrowing rates rise,\ninventory storage expenses rise as well. By precisely\
    \ calculating supply volume in advance\nand devising dynamic operating plans,\
    \ ML [70] approaches help to avoid such risks. Labor\nmanagement, inventory system\
    \ automation, vehicle deployment strategy optimization,\nand supply chain decision-making\
    \ agility may all beneﬁt from machine learning and\ndata analytics methodologies.\
    \ Proper forecasting of demand is critical for supply chain\nplanning and management\
    \ [71]. While demand patterns for basic things like food are\nsomewhat steady,\
    \ demand uncertainty in leisure products like apparel and technology may\nbe signiﬁcant.\
    \ Supply chain managers may use demand forecasting to plan productive\nbusiness\
    \ operations, optimize inventory levels, assess possible hazards, handle demand\n\
    exceptions, and develop mitigation solutions. Inefﬁcient demand forecasting tactics,\
    \ on the\nother hand, can lead to inaccurate projections, which can result in\
    \ considerable ﬁnancial\nlosses for businesses and wastage of food products.\n\
    5. Cyber Security Challenges in a BIoT-Based Supply Chain Network\nSupply chain\
    \ networks are unnecessarily complex due to the involvement of multiple\npersons,\
    \ business enterprises, governments, and maybe even nations. Supply chains\nconfront\
    \ several challenges, including (1) establishing trust amongst numerous parties\n\
    involved; (2) cyberattacks; (3) cargo theft; and (4) counterfeiting, among others.\
    \ However,\nin this section, we are going to discuss only the cyberattacks in\
    \ IoT-based supply chains\nsystems. Food and drinks are the most commonly stolen\
    \ products, but medications and\ngadgets are expensive. The amount of security\
    \ vulnerabilities that a supply chain confronts\nis directly related to the complexity\
    \ of that supply network, i.e., as the supply chain\nbecomes more complex, it\
    \ becomes more vulnerable to various types of security threats.\nThese hazards\
    \ can disrupt supply chain operations in a variety of ways such as fraudulent\n\
    replacement and tamper with items that can lower their utility and make them unpleasant\n\
    for the end-user, the supply chain’s businesses, particularly third-party service\
    \ providers,\nmay not all have the same security requirements, and because information\
    \ technology (IT)\nsystems now control substantial portions of the supply chain,\
    \ cybersecurity is one of the\nmost pressing concerns. The chain is vulnerable\
    \ to a single point of failure due to its heavy\nreliance on a networked IT system.\
    \ Access to one of the systems can lead to access to other\nportions of the system\
    \ that are not as secure.\nThe future implication of IoT is apparent from its\
    \ current applications in every ﬁeld. It\nis growing continuously due to the evolution\
    \ of hardware technologies including enhancing\nbandwidth utilization by addressing\
    \ underutilization of frequency spectrum, improving\nenergy efﬁciency, and extending\
    \ computation and storage features. The cyber-physical\nsystems and wireless sensor\
    \ networks have developed as integral elements for the broader\nterm IoT. As a\
    \ result, the security issues associated with these technologies such as WSN,\n\
    M2M continue to increase. Consequently, with the application of ICT and IoT in\
    \ the\nagriculture industry, the potential risks of security attacks on the smart\
    \ agriculture infras-\ntructure [72] are increasing. Thus, the food sector is\
    \ attracting more security attacks on its\ninfrastructure and production facilities.\
    \ Preventing such attacks needs a multi-disciplinary\napproach [73] that covers\
    \ both hardware and software by policies and security mechanisms\nfor preventing\
    \ cyber-attacks or mitigating their impact on its occurrence. Thus, it is essential\n\
    to identify potential security threats [64] and ﬁnd solutions to prevent these\
    \ threats.\nThe security problems of an IoT network can be classiﬁed into three\
    \ levels: (1) at the\napplication layer, (2) at the network layer, and (3) at\
    \ the perception layer. At the application\nlayer, we require studying three security\
    \ concerns, i.e., user data privacy, encrypted data\nanalysis, and secure computing.\
    \ Thus, when IoT devices are connected with the network,\nidentity authenticity\
    \ and data integrity are required. Without any authentication scheme,\nmalicious\
    \ devices can get access to the network. The IoT devices can access the IoT network\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 40\n12 of 25\napplication layer using cellular networks\
    \ which adopt standard communication protocols.\nThose standard protocols are\
    \ having advanced security. Two types of threats are faced in the\nperception\
    \ layer: (a) many terminals have open insecure ports and numerous vulnerabilities\n\
    that let unauthorized devices access. There are always security risks where hackers\
    \ can\nexploit these weaknesses to launch different attacks and (b) terminals\
    \ connected with short-\nrange ISM band communication protocols such as ZigBee,\
    \ WiFi, and Bluetooth having\nweak security mechanisms, thus are vulnerable to\
    \ security attacks. Moreover, several of\nthese terminals are having weak login\
    \ and password mechanisms. These terminals also\nlack encryption algorithms between\
    \ devices and the network.\nIn this section, we are going to discuss major cyber\
    \ security threats, security require-\nments, and some available solutions. The\
    \ different types of security attacks to which\nthe IoT-based agriculture supply\
    \ chain is vulnerable are discussed in Table 2 Blockchain\ntechnology ﬁnds its\
    \ applications in nearly all areas of IoT, including the IoT-based smart\nagriculture\
    \ supply chain [46,74,75]. The convergence of blockchain with IoT is to preserve\n\
    privacy. Some of the relevant blockchain-based solutions that can be optimized\
    \ for agri-\nsupply chain applications available in the literature are presented\
    \ in Table 3. Apart from\nthe solutions presented in Table 3, there are several\
    \ other methods present in the literature,\nwhich needs to be optimized for IoT-based\
    \ smart agriculture application requirements.\nTable 2. Security Vulnerabilities\
    \ in IoT-based Smart Agri-Food Supply Chain Platforms.\nSecurity Attacks\nDescription\n\
    RF jamming attack\nAttackers can use different distributed low-power jammers to\
    \ disrupt the GNNS and other cellular\nnetwork frequencies to block smart farming\
    \ equipment from working accurately.\nMalware injection attack\nAn attacker can\
    \ steal information; damage the normal working of the agriculture system, etc.\
    \ by injecting\nmalware into a connected device. Any farm infected with the malware\
    \ is likely to infect other farms on\nthe same network. It can have a devastating\
    \ effect on a system.\nDenial of service attacks\nAn attacker ﬂoods a system with\
    \ an enormous number of service requests from a large number of the\nhost machines,\
    \ which the system is not able to withstand and crushes. It does not directly\
    \ beneﬁt the\nattacker but denies the services to the authentic users.\nBOTNET\n\
    If an attacker succeeds to get control of a device on a farm, he can control all\
    \ the devices on that farm and\nturn it into BOTNET. The attacker can then employ\
    \ the infected devices to corrupt many other devices in\nthe network.\nSide-channel\
    \ attack\nRather than exploiting the weakness in the system, this attack exploits\
    \ the data about the implementation\nof the system and the sequence of data being\
    \ transmitted by it.\nReplay attack\nThe attacker can collect a copy of the transmitted\
    \ data packet between two entities and try to deceive an\nauthorized user by retransmission.\n\
    Man-in-the-middle attack\nAn attacker tries to modify or delete the content of\
    \ the message during transmission between two entities\nand then sends it to the\
    \ destination.\nStolen veriﬁer attack\nAn attacker snips authentication data such\
    \ as OTP from the server is present or past veriﬁcation sessions.\nThen uses the\
    \ veriﬁcation data to access the server. If it succeeds, the attacker imitates\
    \ an authorized user\nfor the next session.\nBrute force attack\nAn attacker uses\
    \ all possible passwords to get access to the system until the correct password\
    \ is matched.\nThe attacker also tries to guess the key created from a known key\
    \ derivation function which is called\nexhaustive key search.\nPrivileged-insider\
    \ attack\nAn authorized user attempts to gain unauthorized access to other services\
    \ or resources to modify or\ndelete important information.\nMasquerade attack\n\
    An attacker aims to impersonate as a legitimate entity or node to log into the\
    \ system at agriculture\nsensor layers.\nTracing attack\nAn attacker collects\
    \ a large amount of privacy data at the sensor layer from IoT devices to relate\
    \ with a\ndeﬁnite real identity.\nKnown key attack\nBased on the previous compromised\
    \ keys, an attacker tries to create new session keys.\nResilience against sensing\
    \ device\ncapture attack\nAn adversary may truly hold on to the sensing device\
    \ and obtain the information he wants from the\nseized device to establish a connection\
    \ with other devices in the network. Device capturing results in\nhuge damage\
    \ to the system.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 40\n13 of 25\nTable 2. Cont.\nSecurity\
    \ Attacks\nDescription\nRogue device deployment attack\nAn attack can install\
    \ illegal sensing devices in the IoT network environments. An adversary can even\n\
    replicate the existing compromised sensing device to extract sensitive data and\
    \ use replicated nodes to\ncommunicate with other genuine nodes of the network.\n\
    Sybil attack\nIn this type of attack, an attacker creates several pseudonym identities\
    \ that are misinterpreted as multiple\nentities. This results in numerous requests\
    \ accepted from the same identity and leads to a 51% attack.\nWormhole attack\n\
    An attacker deceits two nodes far away from each other into interacting with each\
    \ other through a\nwormhole tunnel, employing an in-band and out-band communication\
    \ channel, which can bypass across\nnetwork trafﬁc. Therefore, misleading the\
    \ entities into the sense that they are close to one another.\nBlack-hole attack\n\
    An adversary node tries to modify routing-related data to create a scenario in\
    \ which data transfer\nbetween the nodes is not permitted, as a result forming\
    \ a black hole in the network. All the data gets\nstuck in the system and the\
    \ ﬂow of data between nodes is captured.\nSelective forwarding\nIn this type of\
    \ attack, the corrupted node did not forward the data to the next node and also\
    \ stops routing\ndata in some speciﬁc situations.\nEnervation attack\nAn adversary\
    \ tries to deplete the energy resources of the nodes by making them perform some\n\
    unnecessary processes.\nTable 3. Blockchain-based solutions for the cyber security\
    \ threats of IoT-based Agrifood Supply\nChain In-frastructure.\nWork\nYear\nDescription\
    \ (2017–2020)\nJiang et al. [76]\n2018\nSuggested a thin-client authentication\
    \ scheme (PTAS) for IoT applications. It is used to solve the problems\nof single-point\
    \ failure in blockchain-based PKI. This security mechanism is robust against Sybil\
    \ attacks,\neclipse attacks, and 51% attacks.\nShen et al. [77]\n2019\nProvided\
    \ a privacy-preserving mechanism (SVM) for IoT use cases. The scheme uses a public-key\n\

    \ strong towards the known\nciphertext model and known background model attacks.\n\
    Ma et al. [78]\n2019\nThis solution presents a key management architecture based\

    \ access control archetype, where policies of access are controlled\nby a blockchain\
    \ platform. The proposed scheme uses smart contracts and fog nodes to provide\
    \ the\nadvantages of transparency, mobility, accessibility, lightweight, and scalability.\n\
    Ding et al. [80]\n2019\nThe authors came up with a blockchain-based layered architecture\
    \ of a reputation and trust mechanism for\nIoT applications. This archetype is\
    \ proposed to validate the transactions at three key layers of the system\nbased\
    \ on the reputation of the minor generating the node.\nZhou et al. [81]\n2018\n\
    Presented a TSMPC protocol to extend Shamir’s (t, n)-secret sharing (SSS) applied\

    \ for smart\nfarming applications.\nPatel et al. [86]\n2018\nTo overcome security\
    \ issues, the authors proposed a blockchain-based lightweight architecture to\
    \ optimize\nthe energy consumption of the IoT sensor devices and provide secure\
    \ communication among devices in the\nsmart farm environments.\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 40\n14 of 25\n6. Implementation Challenges\nEven though blockchain-based\
    \ internet of things use cases have been investigated,\nbut the impact of ever-growing\
    \ blockchain ledge size [87] has not been considered in these\nstudies. Blockchain-based\
    \ agri-food supply chains are a complex network [61] of inputs\nand outputs from\
    \ farm to the fork and the generation of an enormous quantity of data\nfrom the\
    \ implementation of a huge number of IoT devices at each stage [88]. The data\n\
    produced from the IoT devices are sent to the blockchain as transactions [89].\
    \ As blockchain\nnodes are append-only data storages by deﬁnition. This implies\
    \ that the node’s storage\nspace requirements will constantly rise in direct correlation\
    \ with the number of transactions\nexecuted per second [90].\nThus, the size of\
    \ blockchain grows in proportion to the number of nodes that run\nconcurrently,\
    \ each node will want its own written copy of the blockchain ledger, and\nif you\
    \ are operating at a large scale (hundreds and perhaps even multitudes of nodes),\n\
    data storage space requirements might become a problem [91]. Due to two factors,\
    \ the\nstorage needs for blockchain networks will increase, (i) as the number\
    \ of users expands, the\nnumber of transactions for each second increases, and\
    \ (ii) every transaction expands the\nvolume of the blockchain ledger, and since\
    \ it is append-only, memory usage is continuously\nincreasing. When we evaluate\
    \ this with mutable systems, wherein data gets replaced, we\ncould see how, as\
    \ time passes, we begin to experience the ever-increasing ledger size in\nblockchain-based\
    \ storage systems. There still are techniques to reduce the size of blockchain\n\
    ledgers [92], but there is rising apprehension that the size of these ledgers\
    \ may exceed the\ncapacity of available storage considering the increasing number\
    \ of IoT-based sensors in\nagriculture equipment, smart logistics, agri-stores,\
    \ food processing companies, etc. Simply\nput, we want a system that allows us\
    \ to expand our storage capacity without compromising\nperformance or necessitating\
    \ migrations that would result in downtime. Apart from the\never-increasing ledger\
    \ size, as blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, every\nindustry\
    \ and institution is transitioning from centralized data storage to decentralized\n\
    distributed ledger networks. With each passing day, the use of blockchain and\
    \ decentralized\nledger systems grows. As a result, each sector or organization\
    \ chooses the blockchain\ntechnology that best meets their storage, security and\
    \ privacy, latency, and other needs.\nThus, we need a system where any supply\
    \ chain entity with any distributed technology can\njoin the supply chain while\
    \ maintaining interoperability with the particular supply chain.\nThe new architecture\
    \ of the agri-supply chain also needs to solve interoperability [93],\nscalability,\
    \ security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present\n\
    single-chain networks.\nInteroperability may be improved by using common standards,\
    \ this idea must be\nimplemented since it will ensure that your networks are future-proof\
    \ from the start. Fur-\nthermore, it would promote a strong ecosystem while avoiding\
    \ any vendor lock-in issues.\nIn the foreseeable future, it will all come down\
    \ to interoperability [94]. As a result, adopting\ncommon standards to represent\
    \ your blockchain strategy is a wonderful idea. This is\nsomething to consider\
    \ for blockchain installation companies. Although most platforms are\nsilos, the\
    \ technology looks to be moving toward a paradigm that can support a network\n\
    of networks. You must follow a set of common blockchain implementation standards\
    \ to\nensure that your solution does not fall behind. Furthermore, the initial\
    \ step would be to\ncreate a solution registry. In addition, all blockchain implementation\
    \ companies should\nmake their data models and regulations public. When possible,\
    \ use APIs with permis-\nsioned output, and base your blockchain strategy on industry\
    \ standards. For example, the\nDecentralized Identity Foundation [95] publishes\
    \ a set of rules for identifying digital assets,\npersons, and organizations across\
    \ multiple platforms. A variety of collaborative initiatives,\nsuch as the Enterprise\
    \ Ethereum Alliance’s Burrow and Hyperledger [96], support these\nprinciples.\

    \ scalability,\nsecurity, and privacy of personal data issues with the current\
    \ single-chain networks also\nneed to be addressed along with interoperability.\
    \ To transfer assets in cross-blockchain\nsystems and to solve the storage and\
    \ scalability challenges of existing blockchain-based\nsystems, we have introduced\
    \ a new Agri-SCM-BIoT architecture (see Figure 4) for the\nagriculture supply\
    \ chain.\nThe Agri-SCM-BIoT system uses multiple blockchains to meet the requirements\
    \ of the\nagriculture supply chain business. The local area blockchain, as represented\
    \ in Figure 4,\nconsists of a confederation of logically distinct blockchains\
    \ implemented across multiple\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 40\n16 of 25\nsegments of\
    \ the agri-supply chain network. In which the IoT gateways and edge computing\n\
    nodes [100] function as blockchain member nodes. Consequently, each local area\
    \ blockchain\nsegment can have its blockchain ledger, policies of access control,\
    \ and engagement terms.\nDifferent IoT agriculture business verticals can be represented\
    \ in each edge-level blockchain\norganization. For instance, the multiple-tiered\
    \ architecture of blockchain in the agri-supply\nchain can be used to reduce the\
    \ security attack surface and prevent potential security\nrisks [101] in the supply\
    \ chain by keeping highly sensitive information like banking infor-\nmation away\
    \ from the potential security risk nodes. The different blockchain verticals are\n\
    used to store data of that particular segment like processing enterprise data\
    \ is stored in\nprocessing enterprise blockchain vertical but other entities in\
    \ the network are provided\nwith access to trace back transaction data and other\
    \ information at any time. This reduces\nthe large memory requirement at participating\
    \ nodes; the data turn out to be considerably\nmore manageable and improves the\
    \ latency of the system. In this scenario, the IoT devices\nare not required to\
    \ take part in the consensus process [102], however, issue data transactions\n\
    to local area blockchains. The IoT-based agri- robots, drones [103], and machines\
    \ with\nmobility needs can utilize cellular data networks to send transactions\
    \ to their particular\nblockchain segments.\nThe local area blockchain deployments\
    \ are private blockchains, where resource ex-\nhaustive consensus algorithms [100]\
    \ such as PoW and PoS are not required. Any new node\nfrom outside gains accesses\
    \ by getting permission from its current participating nodes.\nConsensus algorithms\
    \ in permissioned blockchains produce complex network overhead\nwith the increase\
    \ in the node count. Consequently, puts a constraint on the number of\nmember\
    \ nodes, and requires to be adopted in localized networks. Furthermore, several\n\
    design factors need to be considered towards guaranteeing the integrity of local\
    \ area\nblockchain data contents. Since private-permissioned blockchains do not\
    \ accomplish a\nsimilar degree of decentralization and irreversibility as open\
    \ permissionless blockchains,\nit gets important to have the option to demonstrate\
    \ the data of local area blockchains are\nunmodiﬁed. As proof of edge-level trustworthiness,\
    \ it is imperative to either utilize the\ncore-level blockchains to intermittently\
    \ store a hash of some of the latest added blocks in\neach edge-level blockchain\
    \ or utilize an independently separate public blockchain as a\nstore for hashes\
    \ of all local area blockchains. Some speciﬁc local blockchain nodes function\n\
    as gateways between local area blockchain and core blockchains. These gateways\
    \ are very\nsigniﬁcant for developing the inter-blockchain asset transfer in the\
    \ agri-supply chain. The\ncore blockchain segment is implemented between edge\
    \ and cloud storage as shown in\nFigure 5 but it functions as a distributed fabric\
    \ for controlling the core chain itself along\nwith inter-chain communication\
    \ among multiple local blockchains and controls access of\nnew requesting nodes.\n\
    Core-blockchain can be deployed as a public blockchain employing consensus al-\n\
    gorithms like PoW and PoS for ensuring secure data transactions between blockchain\n\
    verticals and users. Real-time communication among the local and core blockchain\

    communications [104] can take place. Inter-blockchain and cross-blockchain communi-\n\
    cation [105] are being investigated by academicians and industries at the protocol\
    \ level.\nTransaction fees can be implemented within the local area blockchain\
    \ to secure the local\nblockchain segments from ﬂooding attacks effectively in\
    \ case any IoT device or devices\nare compromised.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 40\n\

    \ mechanisms, ranging from improved frontline\noperations to improved policy decisions,\

    can properly estimate consumer demand using big data analysis and advanced predicting\n\
    methodologies that take into account many elements such as weather, special events,\
    \ and\nconstantly evolving marketing trends. Amazon aims to use a predictive delivery\

    \ algorithms can be used\nto analyze the behavior of sensor nodes to detect any\
    \ adversaries and potential security\nthreats in the network. If any node is behaving\
    \ maliciously, we can remove that node\nwithout affecting the rest of the network\
    \ by comparing the current node behavior with the\nnormal behavior of the node.\n\
    Thus, blockchains in food-supply chains can strengthen the growing transparency\
    \ in\nsupply chains due to the immutable transparent and decentralized nature\
    \ of blockchain.\nIt has the potential to impact each stage of the agriculture\
    \ value chain. With IoT and\nsmart contracts, blockchain could trace back the\
    \ problem source, give real-time alerts on\nproblem occurrence, assist in establishing\
    \ conﬁdence and trust between farmers, industries,\nand consumers. Besides, facilitate\

    \ be employed for food certiﬁcation. Due to its automated nature,\nthe proposed\
    \ methodology provides signiﬁcant efﬁciency gains, which removes hidden\nexpenses\
    \ and paper burdens from the agriculture supply chain traceability process. Aside\n\
    from the fundamental security and privacy of blockchain technology architecture,\
    \ the\npresented models provide tremendous advantages regarding auditability and\
    \ trust (au-\nditable records) which can be viewed and utilized by important participants\
    \ or external\nstakeholders such as regulators, legislators, and so on). It should\
    \ also be mentioned that\nthe suggested modeling technique has the considerable\
    \ quality and reliability beneﬁts. An\nimmutable and decentralized traceability\
    \ technology protects quality by detecting and\npreventing tampering with food\
    \ data. As a result, the excellent quality of food items given\nto end-customers\
    \ strengthens the agriculture food supply chain participants’ business\noperations.\
    \ The proposed system will have the following characteristics as discussed.\n\
    7.1. System Storage and Performance Enhancement\nThe continuous expanding nature\
    \ of blockchain affects the throughput and redun-\ndancy by exhausting the system\
    \ resources with managing the expanded data processing\nand communications [114].\
    \ The application of PoW for fast mining is a very expensive and\npower-intense\
    \ consensus algorithm that reduces the performance of the whole blockchain\nnetwork.\
    \ By applying modular architecture can solve the ever-increasing size of blockchain\n\
    in the state-of-the-art by storing data on multiple blockchains. The different\
    \ blockchain\nmodules such as farm blockchain will store data related to farms\
    \ and processing enterprise\nblockchain will data related to different enterprises.\
    \ This core blockchain module is de-\nsigned to store only hash values of the\
    \ previous transactions to solve the expanding ledger\nsize issues and lower blockchains\
    \ (private blockchain verticals) blockchain is used to store\ntransaction data.\
    \ The bulk data is stored in the blockchain-based cloud storage for further\n\
    data abstraction and processing.\n7.2. Privacy and Security Enhancement\nIn traditional\
    \ blockchain systems, the data is stored on a single ledger, and every\nnode in\
    \ the network can access that information. This enables the users to access the\n\
    data that they do not require access to, thus giving rise to data conﬁdentiality\
    \ issues.\nBesides, there are other security vulnerabilities and threats such\
    \ as 51% of attacks and\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 40\n19 of 25\ndouble-spending attack\
    \ problems. In the proposed architecture, we have tried to reduce\nthe security\
    \ attack surface and prevent potential security risks in the supply chain by\n\
    making highly sensitive information inaccessible from potential high-risk nodes.\
    \ There\nare some master nodes in each blockchain vertical that are authorized\
    \ to coordinate and\ncommunicate with other blockchain verticals. These master\
    \ nodes are made highly secure\nand have high computational resources than other\
    \ nodes, which reduces the risk of 51%\nattacks as well. Some of the data transactions\
    \ require to get veriﬁed by multiple blockchain\nvertical veriﬁcation. This gives\
    \ an additional layer of security along with decreasing\ntransaction congestion\
    \ in one blockchain vertical as transactions get shifted to another\nvertical.\
    \ The participating corporations or entities in the smart agriculture supply chain\
    \ can\nkeep the secrecy of their information and specify complex smart contract-based\
    \ veriﬁcation\nwithin the network.\n7.3. Cross-Chain Communication between Heterogeneous\
    \ Blockchain Platforms\nIn the proposed architecture, we can think through a multi-organization\
    \ setup where\norganizations can communicate with multiple organizations (i.e.,\
    \ one or more). These un-\nderlying blockchain networks connected these entities\
    \ could be a private or public network\n(permissioned or permissionless) and each\
    \ cooperate has its own IoT applications and busi-\nness models [106]. The proposed\
    \ model proposes the amalgamation of cooperate-owned\nprivate and public blockchains\
    \ that facilitates veriﬁcation of private data and exchange of\npublic data as\
    \ required. The private information of different organizations makes the block\n\
    generation rate unpredictable. This property makes it hard for the adversary to\
    \ execute\nmalicious activities in comparison to a public blockchain where block\
    \ generation is known.\n7.4. IoT Device Authentication and Data Authentication\
    \ and Integrity\nDue to heavy IPv6 stake for IoT devices, we will use 20-byte\
    \ addressing generated by\nusing the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm\
    \ (ECDSA) in blockchain, which will\nact as a global unique identity (GUID) need\
    \ no individual authentication for each IoT device\ndue to a large number of addresses\
    \ generated (about 1.46 × 1048) having exceptionally low\ncollision likelihood.\
    \ The IoT devices will authenticate and sign the data by the assigned\nGUI before\
    \ transmission, thus authorizing the data authentication and integrity. The use\
    \ of\nGUID can eradicate the need for a public-key management system, therefore\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsimplifying the other security protocols. Thus, lightweight security\
    \ protocols can be used\nfor communication in resource constraint devices. Big\
    \ data analytics employing deep\nlearning and machine learning algorithms can\
    \ be used to analyze the behavior of sensor\nnodes to detect any adversaries and\
    \ potential security threats in the network. If any node\nis behaving maliciously,\
    \ we can remove that node without affecting the rest of the network\nby comparing\
    \ the current node behavior with the normal behavior of the node.\n7.5. Managerial\
    \ Implications of Various Stakeholders\nWith the apparent technical transformations\
    \ delivered by blockchain, big data, AI, and\nsmart farming, we look to comprehend\
    \ the stakeholder networks around the smart farm.\nThese technologies have caused\
    \ a signiﬁcant advancement in the partner network function\nand how they interact\
    \ with one another in the food supply chain [115]. In the proposed\nsystem architecture,\
    \ the implementation of multiple blockchains for different levels is used\nto\
    \ improve the efﬁciency of data management and privacy of the stakeholders in\
    \ the smart\nagriculture system. Each stakeholder needs to manage and store the\
    \ related data to that\nblockchain vertical. Thus, reduces the resource consumption\
    \ by miners in storing the\nsame information by different stakeholders, but the\
    \ shared data of one stakeholder can\nbe accessed by other stakeholders through\
    \ a speciﬁc established authentication process\n(consensus process).\nAgriculture\

    \ in food supply chains can strengthen the growing transparency in supply\nchains\

    \ negatively inﬂuences the\naccuracy of the process, as stakeholders such as farmers\
    \ are fearful of information leak-\nage during transfer to other external systems.\
    \ Moreover, participants in the agri-supply\nchain do not want to share their\
    \ information with the business rivals in a transparent\nsystem. Even though different\
    \ schemes for data security and privacy, like ring signatures,\nhave been utilized\
    \ for blockchain-based farming, there are no techniques to conceal the\ntransaction\
    \ data of senders and recipients and the amount of the transaction. Hence, in-\n\
    formation control and assurance are signiﬁcant in IoT and blockchain-based agribusiness.\n\
    Future studies should concentrate on how to concurrently hide the multi-party\
    \ transac-\ntion information in hypothetical examination and implementation practices.\
    \ Also, the\nroles and elements of governments in endorsing these new technological\
    \ developments\nshould be assessed. Besides, it is also critical to assess the\
    \ behavior of users and hence\nadd to information assurance, and how to lessen\
    \ reservation of information sharing in\nblockchain-based agribusiness.\nScalability\
    \ issues come in the study of both IoT and blockchain-based agri-sector.\nCritical\
    \ problems of latency and scalability are not studied sufﬁciently in the blockchain-\n\
    based agriculture supply chain. The convergence of different technologies like\
    \ IoT and AI\nin the blockchain is already been investigated in academia and industry\
    \ for sustainability.\nThen the outcome of the investigations can be applied to\
    \ the innovation for agriculture\nindustry sustainable development.\nThe apprehension\
    \ of ﬁnancial investment retrieval in the implementation of these\nadvanced technologies\
    \ among farmers is a concern. Future opportunities should utilize\nthe “theory\
    \ of inventive problem solving” to develop technologies to decrease expenses.\n\
    Political scholars require researching how to encourage policymakers efﬁciently\
    \ to devise\nproper policies to encourage technology innovation. High energy usage\
    \ and carbon dioxide\nemissions are the foremost glitches, which oppose the objective\
    \ of a sustainable environ-\nment. Further research needs to perform comparative\
    \ studies on the development of\nagri-sector, based on different IoT and blockchain\
    \ applications, to distinguish and promote\neco-friendly and green technologies.\n\
    The nonexistence of uniform standards is the main hindrances to policies and guide-\n\
    lines with which participants can follow. These standards build up market stability\
    \ by\nregulating the participants’ behavior, boosting public trust, and the adoption\
    \ of technolog-\nical inventions. Future investigation can study policies and\
    \ standards in the agriculture\nsector; though, implementation of identical standards\
    \ is deeply dependent on various\nstakeholders in the supply chain who control\
    \ the equipment, systems, hardware, and\nsoftware development. For imposing standards\
    \ at various points of the supply chain future\nstudies must examine the government\
    \ roles and functions. Researchers should explore\nhow management integrates resources,\
    \ synchronize, addresses conﬂicts, and promote more\nschemes to enhance the impacts\
    \ of these technologies in the agri-sector.\n9. Conclusions\nIt is well understood\
    \ from the literature review that the application of blockchain, AI,\nand IoT\
    \ in agriculture is still in the developing stage. The existing work mainly comprises\n\
    evocative and prescriptive studies with very few deﬁnite systems being designed\
    \ and\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 40\n21 of 25\nimplemented, even at the prototype\
    \ level. There is a requirement of implementing a\nlarge number of real-time use\
    \ cases to analyze the suggested results that many existing\nworks claim including\
    \ improved performance, intelligent decision support, security, and\nprivacy of\
    \ different acting entities throughout the supply chain, enhanced food safety,\
    \ and\nenvironment-friendly techniques. Besides, there is a need to develop optimization\
    \ tools to\nimplement the existing solutions of these technologies in agriculture\
    \ applications and can\nassist in addressing various implementation challenges.\
    \ Motivated by the characteristics\nand solutions offered by technologies such\
    \ as blockchain technology, IoT, and AI to deliver\nreliable, transparent, secure\
    \ services and smart decision support systems for all supply\nchain management\
    \ operations, this study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT architecture (cf. Figure 5)\n\
    to address storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and\
    \ privacy issues,\nand storage concerns with existing single-chain agriculture\
    \ supply chain systems. The\nnew Agri-SCM-IoT infrastructure should be built to\
    \ use as minimum computing power,\nmemory, energy, and bandwidth as possible.\
    \ Because of the sensors’ limited capabilities,\nincluding security elements to\
    \ ensure Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability is difﬁcult.\nHowever, because\
    \ it includes several stakeholders and diverse parties, it is necessary\nto develop\
    \ a trustworthy blockchain-based cross-chain SCM system. The future smart\nand\
    \ secure SCM system should be resource-efﬁcient, appropriate, simple to implement,\n\
    provide interoperability, and most importantly, trustworthy without the need for\
    \ human\nparticipation. Even though the literature studied on the blockchain,\
    \ AI, and IoT in the\nagriculture supply chain highlight remarkable growth in\
    \ the sector, there are signiﬁcant\nlimitations and research gaps hindering the\
    \ implementation of these technologies and\nextensively the sustainable development\
    \ of the agriculture sector. We expect that this\nstudy will provide enhanced\
    \ understanding and guidance for the further research and\nimplementation of smart\
    \ agri-supply chain management using these technologies.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    • 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain are identified. • An
    integrated approach based on the diffusion of innovation and business technology
    adoption model is used. • The prominence and interrelationships between different
    blockchain adoption enablers are established. • Insights on enhancing blockchain
    adoption in the supply chain are given. Abstract Blockchain technology has been
    growing in importance and acceptability over the past few years. Yet, there is
    limited empirical research on the organizational and technology specific factors
    that play a critical role in driving its adoption in the supply chain. The purpose
    of this paper is to develop a comprehensive framework for blockchain adoption
    in the supply chain by identifying the enablers and empirically evaluating their
    interdependencies and impact on adoption. 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in
    the supply chain are identified using an extensive literature review and theoretical
    lenses from the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory and the business technology
    adoption model developed by Iacovou, Benbassat and Dexter (1995). In the confirmatory
    phase, we employ the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    method to extract logic from data collected from 37 French experts about the impact
    of the enablers and their interdependencies. Our paper extends the multi-theoretic
    empirical studies to blockchain technology and identifies the enablers of blockchain
    adoption from technological, organizational, supply chain and external environment
    perspectives. Regarding the importance of the categories of enablers, we find
    that the relative advantage of the technology and the external pressure are the
    most prominent categories of enablers that impact blockchain adoption in the supply
    chain. Our analysis also shows the important causal role on adoption of the potential
    of blockchain to reduce transaction cost, the consumer interest in traceability
    data and the establishment of a regulatory framework for blockchain usage. Previous

    chain managementDEMATEL 1. Introduction Blockchain technology has recently gained
    importance as a promising technology in the area of supply chain management. For
    instance, Maersk used an IBM blockchain solution to efficiently track its containers
    around the world (Popper and Lohr, 2017). Catina Volpone vineyard (www.cantinavolpone.it)
    in Puglia, Italy and Ernst and Young''s EZ Lab (www.ezlab.it) developed a blockchain-based
    solution that enables full transparency through the wine supply chain and allows
    customers to access information about the harvesting, pressing, and bottling dates
    and conditions, among many other details for each bottle or case of wine (Montecchi
    et al., 2019). Similarly, Walmart and IBM have successfully implemented a blockchain-based
    solution for tracking pork products in China with a farm-to-table approach, providing
    transparency and full information about the supply chain stages every individual
    product went through (Yiannas, 2017). Blockchain solutions providers such as Everledger
    (everledger.io), Provenance (provenance.org), Bext360 (bext360.com) conducted
    pilot projects and offered typical use cases that demonstrate blockchain potential
    in verifying and certifying the origin, authenticity and integrity of products
    such as diamond, wine buttles, luxury fashion, coffee beans, and medicines (Kshetri,
    2018; Montecchi et al., 2019; Lacity, 2018; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020). Enabling
    traceability, enhancing transparency and establishing product provenance as shown
    in the above examples are not the only benefits of using blockchain technology.
    Indeed, blockchain is a distributed ledger (database) through which supply chain
    partners can interact and create, verify, validate, and securely store various
    kinds of records such as product information, certificates, localization data,
    transaction records, data acquired from sensors and other connected devices (Crosby
    et al., 2016; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Thus, in addition to providing traceability
    and making the whole history of products digitally available, blockchain promises
    to improve supply chain coordination and process efficiency (Kshetri, 2018; Babich
    and Hilary, 2020; Queiroz et al., 2020; Wamba et al., 2020) and to achieve supply
    chain sustainability goals (Casey and Wong, 2017; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018;
    Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Despite the promises and the enormous
    potential of blockchain technology, its adoption in supply chains is still underexplored.
    Few studies address this question, offering a fragmented view of adoption''s enablers.
    Our objective in this research is to further investigate blockchain adoption in
    supply chains, develop a comprehensive framework for adoption enablers, measure
    their level of influence and understand their mutual relationships. Our work answers
    the following questions: RQ1: What are the enablers of blockchain technology adoption
    in the supply chain? RQ2: What are the levels of influence of the identified enablers
    on the adoption decision? RQ3: How do the enablers interact and influence each
    other? We base our study on an integrative theoretical approach that combines
    the Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory (Rogers, 2010) and the business technology
    adoption model developed in Iacovou, Benbasat and Dexter (1995). The choice of
    these theoretical lenses allows us to extend the technology adoption framework
    to include factors related to the technology itself, the organization at both
    the firm and the supply chain levels, and the environment. As for the empirical
    investigation, we use the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    methodology (Gabus and Fontela, 1972) to analyze data collected from experts in
    supply chain or IT management working in France. DEMATEL is very appropriate for
    our purpose because it is designed for modeling relationships and interdependencies
    between a large number of factors and evaluating their impact. Our paper provides
    both theoretical and practical contributions that improve our understanding of
    the enablers of blockchain adoption in supply chains and offer guidance to managers
    and policymakers on how they can best direct their efforts to enhance adoption.
    From the theory perspective, our work is the first effort to provide an extensive
    list of enabling factors of blockchain adoption in supply chains, evaluate their
    effects and map their interdependencies. It also adds contribution to the very
    limited body of research that uses a multi-theoretic framework to establish the
    theoretical context of blockchain technology adoption for the supply chain management.
    Our study also contributes to the practice by providing an evaluation of the importance
    of the enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain and by analyzing their
    interdependencies. Managers and policymakers may use the results and insights
    from this study to inform their decisions and action plans for blockchain adoption
    in their supply chains. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
    In Section 2, we provide an overview of the literature on blockchain technology
    applications in supply chain management and its adoption. In Section 3, we develop
    a theoretical framework for considering blockchain adoption in supply chains and
    identify the enablers of adoption from the literature. Research methodology and
    data collection are presented in Section 4. The results obtained are presented
    and discussed in Section 5. Then, Section 6 presents implications and managerial
    insights from our study, and Section 7 conclude the paper. 2. Background 2.1.
    Blockchain technology Blockchain technology can be defined as a peer-to-peer network
    technology that is used to build and maintain distributed ledgers or databases
    of records (Crosby et al., 2016; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Parties participating
    in a blockchain (firms, institutions, individuals, etc.) can interact with each
    other and create all kinds of records (product information, certificates, localization
    data, transaction records, data acquired from sensors, etc.). Before being stored
    on the blockchain, records are verified and validated using specific consensus
    mechanisms (Crosby et al., 2016). Then, records are combined to form a block of
    data that is linked with previous blocks to form a chain of blocks or a “blockchain”.
    Data in a blockchain is ordered chronologically, every block of the chain contains
    a hash of the previous blocks, and the whole database is replicated and stored
    on different nodes of the system (Crosby et al., 2016). There exist public (permissionless)
    and private (permissioned) blockchains (Casey and Wong, 2017). A public blockchain
    is generally open and allows everyone to have access to the data. A typical example
    of an open blockchain is the one used to develop Bitcoin. On the opposite, a private
    blockchain is restrained to a given number of predefined participants who may
    have different levels of permission to record and access data. Both public and
    private blockchains are characterized by the implementation of consensus mechanisms
    to validate data, the use of cryptographic links between the blocks of the chain
    and the creation of replicates of the whole database in multiple nodes of the
    network (Crosby et al., 2016; Casey and Wong, 2017). These characteristics offer
    the guarantee that data recorded on a blockchain is valid, immune against any
    alteration and protected against the failure of some of the nodes of the system
    (Crosby et al., 2016; Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Though blockchain
    technology was first created and implemented to support cryptocurrency transactions
    (Nakamoto, 2008), it found application in various domains and business sectors
    (Carson et al., 2018; Lacity, 2018). Across sectors, multiple use cases demonstrate
    the high potential of blockchain technology in achieving operations and supply
    chain management goals (Hackius and Petersen, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Queiroz et
    al., 2020). 2.2. Use of blockchain technology in supply chain management A supply
    chain is typically composed of independent organizations which are directly involved
    in the upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, and/or information
    from a source to a customer (Mentzer et al., 2001). Effective management of a
    supply chain requires members to cooperate and mutually share information (Gunasekaran
    et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2002; Carr and Kaynak, 2007; Fawcett et al., 2011).
    In this regard, blockchain technology promises to drastically improve supply chain
    management and achieve supply chain performance objectives by providing a platform
    for direct interaction between supply chain members to exchange credible and tamper-proof
    data (Casey and Wong, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Queiroz et
    al., 2020; Wamba et al., 2020). One of the main benefits of this technology is
    that it enables full product traceability and enhances visibility through the
    different supply chain stages (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020).
    For instance, using smart tagging and blockchain technology, the UK-based blockchain
    solutions provider Provenance was able to successfully track fish caught by fishermen
    in Indonesia, and provide robust proof of compliance to standards from the origin
    and along the chain to consumers (https://www.provenance.org). Another example
    of blockchain-enabled product tracking is the pilot project conducted by Walmart
    in collaboration with IBM to digitally track pork products in China from the farm
    to the customer table. The technology enabled timely digital access to full individual
    pork product data, including the farm it comes from, factory it went through,
    the batch number, the storage temperature and shipping details (Yiannas, 2017).
    In addition to product tracking, blockchain offers powerful solutions for acquiring
    and aggregating detailed product information that may be used to authenticate
    products and certify their origin, as well as to assure product quality and integrity
    (Montecchi et al., 2019). For instance, the startup Everledger (https://www.everledger.io)
    has developed blockchain-based solutions to create and maintain unique identifying
    data for individual units of products in various sectors. The solutions are used
    for tracking and authenticating wine bottles (Kshetri, 2018), as well as for providing
    quality assurance and helping jewelers comply with regulations in diamond industry
    (Casey and Wong, 2017). Blockchain may also be used by Supply chain members to
    share demand, inventory, and capacity-related data. This data may then be selectively
    aggregated through the different tiers of the supply chain and used to improve
    supply chain coordination and operational efficiency (Babich and Hilary, 2020).
    A higher degree of coordination and operational efficiency may also be obtained
    through the implementation of blockchain enabled smart contracts to automate transactions
    among supply chain members (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Blockchain
    technology is instrumental in achieving supply chain sustainability goals (Kouhizadeh
    and Sarkis, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Indeed, product provenance
    knowledge helps in fighting against product counterfeiting (Alzahrani, N., and
    Bulusu, N., 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019), while product tracking capabilities
    help in better planning and implementing reverse logistics operations, such as
    product takeback, product reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling (Kouhizadeh and
    Sarkis, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). The technology may also be used by supply
    chain members to share sustainability-related data from the different processing
    and transportation stages the product went through. Then, by aggregating this
    data, the overall product carbon footprint can be efficiently evaluated, as it
    has been demonstrated by Shakhbulatov et al. (2019) for transportation operations
    in the food industry. Blockchain technology may also be used by Supply chain members
    to upload certificates of compliance with different sustainability standards,
    which may then be compiled to ascertain claims of product and supply chain sustainability
    (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Furthermore, using blockchain
    technology is believed to improve supply chain risk management (Kouhizadeh and
    Sarkis, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020) and supply chain resilience
    (Dubey et al., 2020) in addition to lowering transaction costs between the supply
    chain members (Kshetri, 2018; Schmidt and Wagner, 2019; Wamba et al., 2020). 2.3.
    Adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain The innovative nature of
    blockchain technology and its potential for improving supply chain management
    has woken the interest in investigating the challenges and enablers of its adoption
    in supply chain context. In a pioneering work, Casey and Wong (2017) discussed
    the obstacles related to blockchain technology adoption in global supply chains
    and highlighted the challenges related to the interoperability between different
    blockchains and the complexity of the rules and regulations that govern contracting
    and commercial exchange, especially across national borders. Thus, to further
    encourage blockchain adoption in global supply chains, the authors advocate agreeing
    on standards and rules for interoperability between blockchains, as well as adapting
    current regulations and industry practices to the new dematerialized, automated
    and global nature of blockchains (Casey and Wong, 2017). Drawing on in-depth interviews
    with supply chain experts, Wang et al. (2019) reported on the perceived challenging
    nature of the complexity of the technology and its high cost of implementation.
    They also highlighted the need for establishing clear governance rules for blockchains
    and providing interoperability between two or more different blockchains and between
    blockchains and other existing systems, in addition to resolving the problematic
    question of data ownership. Leveraging lessons from RFID implementation research
    by using a multi-approach methodology based on focus group, survey and cases,
    van Hoek (2019) highlighted the importance of multiple internal and external drivers
    in addition to management commitment for blockchain implementation. In a study
    involving four supply chains in the dairy food sector, Behnke and Janssen (2020)
    identified 18 boundary conditions for using blockchain solutions to provide product
    traceability. These conditions were then aggregated in 5 categories which are:
    firm''s internal business processes and information system-related conditions
    such as the technical capacity and ability of different supply chain members to
    maintain traceability; supply chain process conditions that involve the interface
    and consistency between internal and external supply chain-related processes;
    traceability conditions that comprise consensus between supply chain members on
    the type, level of details and granularity of traceability data; quality-related
    conditions that involve consistency between supply chain members with regards
    to quality data; and regulatory conditions in relation with compliance to different
    product, country or customer-specific regulations. Using an integrative framework
    composed of institutional, market and technical factors Janssen et al. (2020)
    suggest that blockchain adoption may be negatively impacted by the resistance
    of organizations to change, the lack of understanding of the technology, the need
    for new regulations, the need for appropriate governance framework of blockchain,
    the cost of adoption and implementation of blockchain, the need for standardizing
    the information exchange processes, among other factors. Focusing on blockchain
    technology used for managing supply chain sustainability, Saberi et al. (2019)
    identified four groups of barriers that may hinder the adoption of this technology:
    intra-organizational barriers, inter-organizational barriers, system-related barriers,
    and external barriers. Building on Saberi et al. (2019) and using the Technology,
    Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) analyze
    the relations between the four groups of barriers and their impact on the adoption
    of blockchain solutions for managing sustainability in supply chains. Their results
    demonstrate that the lack of management commitment and support, lack of knowledge
    and expertise, lack of cooperation, coordination and information disclosure between
    supply chain members, lack of policies and industry involvement are prominent
    barriers to blockchain adoption for the sustainable supply chain management. The
    above works are mostly oriented towards identifying impediments and challenges
    of blockchain technology implementation in supply chains. Adopting a different
    perspective, Kamble et al. (2020) examined the enabling factors of blockchain
    adoption for traceability in agriculture supply chain and highlighted the positive
    influence of the blockchain-enabled reduction of transaction cost, information
    sharing and data security. In a study of the organizational enablers of blockchain
    adoption in supply chains, Clohessy and Acton (2019) found that top management
    support and organizational readiness are significant determinants of blockchain
    adoption, and large companies are more likely to adopt blockchain than small to
    medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using the TOE framework and survey results, Wong
    et al. (2020) find that blockchain complexity, cost and relative advantage have
    significant effects on the intention to adopt blockchain technology for supply
    chain management in Malaysian SMEs. Considering blockchain adoption by individual
    users in supply chain context, Kamble et al. (2019) find that perceived usefulness
    is a determinant factor of technology adoption by practitioners. Queiroz and Wamba
    (2019) also build and test a model for blockchain adoption by supply chain practitioners
    and demonstrate that higher performance expectancy (i.e., improvement in job activities
    that blockchain can bring for the SCM professionals) encourages adoption. In our
    study, we adopt a comprehensive approach and use elements from all the above studies
    to build an extended list of blockchain adoption enablers in the supply chain.
    We then evaluate the levels of influence of these enablers and their interactions
    using DEMATEL methodology. Kamble et al. (2020) and Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) are
    the closest research papers to our work as they also use DEMATEL. However, multiple
    differences between this literature and our study do exist and allow us to add
    new results and insights to the extant literature. A fundamental difference that
    distinguishes our study from Kamble et al. (2020) is that our approach is not
    restrained to any particular sector while Kamble et al. (2020) is focused on blockchain
    adoption in agriculture supply chain. As for Kouhizadeh et al. (2021), our study
    is different from this paper from various perspectives, including the theoretical
    background, the scope, the methodology, the survey sample and the analysis. The
    theoretical background used in Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) is composed of force field
    theory and TOE framework, while we use the DOI theory combined with the Business
    Technology Adoption model developed in Iacovou et al. (1995). With regards to
    the scope, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) studies the barriers to blockchain adoption
    and use the broader scope of sustainable supply chain management that encompasses
    economic, social and environmental aspects of supply chain management while we
    analyze enablers of adoption using the traditional approach to supply chain management
    which focuses mainly on the economic aspect of management. Though there exist
    some overlapping between the scopes of the two studies leading to similarities
    between some of the factors investigated, the lists of factors used in the two
    studies present much more differences than similarities. Differences are mainly
    due to the fact that we consider enablers and have a deep focus on the economic
    pillar of supply chain management while Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) consider barriers
    and widen the scope to integrate social and environmental pillars. From a methodology
    perspective, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) proceed hierarchically by investigating
    the influences between categories of barriers and then between the barriers within
    each category. Contrasting with this hierarchical approach, we acquire the respondents’
    evaluations of direct mutual influences between all the enablers taken together.
    While each method has its advantages and limits, ours allows for capturing and
    analyzing the direct mutual influences among all the enablers. Lastly, our analysis
    is focused on getting insights from practitioners in different industries and
    sectors, while a major part of the work in Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) is dedicated
    to comparing results from academics with those obtained from practitioners. Given
    these differences with existing literature, our study adds new results and insights.
    3. Theoretical framework and enabling factors of blockchain technology adoption
    in the supply chain In this section, we present the theoretical framework for
    blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Then we use this framework to identify
    the adoption enablers based on an extensive review of the literature. 3.1. Theoretical
    framework The theoretical approach used in this study is based on two complementary
    theories on innovation and technology adoption. The first theory is the diffusion
    of innovation (DOI) (Rogers, 2010). DOI posits that adoption of any new technological
    innovation is largely determined by five attributes that are: the complexity of
    the innovation, its compatibility with the organization, the benefit or advantage
    that it offers compared to other existing technological choices, its observability
    and trialability. Two of these factors i.e., trialability and observability have
    often been dropped from IT innovation literature (Chong et al., 2009). This is
    because, by nature of organizational adoption of technology, these become top-down
    activity where the organization imposes the new IT innovation with limited trialability
    for its constituents. For the same reasons, observability of new IT innovation
    within the organization is also limited and hence the factor is not included in
    DOI-based models when analyzing IT innovations (Chong et al., 2009; Oliveira et
    al., 2014). While DOI focuses on the innovation''s characteristics responsible
    for adoption and diffusion of new technologies, it is widely recognized that IT
    adoption at the firm level is subject to organizational and external context-related
    factors(Oliveira and Martins, 2011). Hence, it is imperative to study organizational
    and context-related factors in any firm level technology adoption. Given these
    concerns with taking a single theoretic approach to study technology adoption
    and the limitations of DOI, researchers have argued for and utilized multi-theoretical
    approaches (Hong et al., 2021; Wamba et al., 2020). A theoretical framework like
    DOI needs to be supplemented with a more organization and external context specific
    framework to embrace the complete array of factors impacting the adoption. Iacovou,
    Benbassat and Dexter (1995) provide an appropriate lens to fulfill this purpose.
    Indeed, the framework in Iacovou et al. (1995) was developed to provide a deeper
    understanding of the way organizational, external and technology specific factors
    impact the adoption of technology by firms. It includes organizational factors
    related to the technological and financial readiness of the adopting organization
    along with external factors related to the organization''s environment, such as
    partners, regulations and competition. As such the model provides a perfect complementary
    view to the DOI framework to study various factors that have a role to play in
    technology adoption by organizations. Based on the above discussion, we argue
    that five groups of enablers that include three innovation characteristics (relative
    advantage, compatibility and complexity) in addition to organizational and external
    context-related factors shape the situation where a firm must make the decision
    to adopt blockchain technology in the supply chain, as shown in Fig. 1. In the
    following sub-sections, these five categories of enablers are further explained
    and the enablers that compose each one of them are identified based on an extensive
    review of the literature. Download : Download high-res image (187KB) Download

    3.1.1. Organizational readiness Organizational readiness refers to the organization''s
    financial and technological capacities that affect the implementation and use
    of the technology (Iacovou et al., 1995). Implementing blockchain technology requires
    investing in various kinds of software and hardware and using sophisticated information
    systems for collecting, storing and communicating data (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017).
    Therefore, in our model of blockchain adoption in the supply chain, this dimension
    comprises factors that reflect the technological capabilities of the firm (Behnke
    and Janssen, 2020; Bumblauskas et al. 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); the knowledge
    and expertise in using the technology (Behnke and Janssen, 2020; Mendling et al.,
    2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020) and the availability of the financial
    resources required for implementing the technology (Wang et al., 2019; Janssen
    et al., 2020). Extant literature identifies top management commitment as being
    influential on the adoption of inter-organizational information systems (Gunasekaran
    and Ngai, 2008). Indeed, management commitment allows for devoting the necessary
    human and financial resources for implementing the technology and the organizational
    change (Saberi et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al., 2021; van Hoek, 2019). Thus, we
    posit management commitment as an enabler of blockchain adoption and map it to
    the organizational readiness dimension. 3.1.2. Relative advantage The relative
    advantage of an innovation can be defined by the increase in the economic benefit
    and the impact that the innovation brings compared to existing systems that it
    replaces (Rogers, 2010). Relative advantage is often found to be positively correlated
    with the adoption of innovations (Kapoor et al., 2014). It is also found to be
    an antecedent of technology adoption in the supply chain context (Brandon-Jones
    and Kauppi, 2018). Literature reports that, compared to other existing systems,
    blockchain technology better ensures data integrity (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich
    and Hilary, 2020; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019), improve
    data availability from multiple sources and supply chain members (Casey and Wong,
    2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; van Hoek, 2019). In
    addition, it is widely admitted that using this technology reduces the cost of
    transactions between supply chain members (Kshetri, 2018; Schmidt and Wagner,
    2019; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020; Wamba et al., 2020). Note that the transaction
    cost considered here is different from the concept of overall cost of ownership
    of blockchain. Indeed, while studies like Kshetri (2018), Schmidt and Wagner (2019),
    Tönnissen and Teuteberg (2020) and Wamba et al. (2020) point out the contribution
    of blockchain to lowering transaction cost, other works like Wang et al. (2019)
    and Janssen et al. (2020) insist on the challenging nature of blockchain implementation
    cost. To our knowledge, a thorough study of the overall cost-related impact of
    blockchain adoption (cost of implementation, the resulting reduction in transaction
    costs and the return on investment) doesn''t exist yet. This represents a critical
    gap in literature, where the cost-related implications of blockchain adoption
    in a supply chain need to be studied. In our study, we focus on the enablers of
    adoption. We thus include the capacity of blockchain to lower transaction cost
    in our list of enablers. We map the three enablers discussed above to the relative
    advantage dimension in our theoretical framework. 3.1.3. Compatibility The compatibility
    refers to the degree of consistency between the innovation and existing values,
    experience and needs of the organization (Rogers, 2010). Blockchain technology
    is typically used in supply chain management to create and share unique data records
    among trade partners to increase transparency and visibility of information through
    the whole supply chain (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Montecchi
    et al., 2019). Its implementation may require changing internal operational processes
    to maintain internal traceability and support the required level of details in
    data (Mendling et al., 2018; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020). It also requires
    the willingness and capacity of supply chain members to share data and to cooperate
    for establishing common process standards, rules for information disclosure and
    related supply chain objectives. Therefore, we map to the compatibility dimension
    the enablers related to these aspects, which are: ease in implementing process
    and organizational changes to accommodate blockchain adoption and use (Mendling
    et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); availability
    of credible and accurate data from the internal processes (Behnke and Janssen,
    2020; Wang et al., 2019); cultural aspects related to the propensity for transparency
    among the supply chain members (Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020; Kouhizadeh
    et al., 2021); cooperation between supply chain members to agree on common rules
    for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (Wang et al., 2019; Behnke and
    Janssen, 2020; Kouhizadeh et al., 2021); cooperation for process standardization
    and agreement between supply chain members on the type and level of details of
    the data to be shared on the blockchain (Casey and Wong, 2017; Bumblauskas et
    al. 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Behnke and Janssen, 2020; Janssen et al., 2020);
    cooperation between the supply chain members to adopt common objectives from using
    the technology (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Wang et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al.,
    2021). 3.1.4. Complexity Complexity indicates to which degree the innovation is
    perceived as being difficult to understand and use (Rogers, 2010). Blockchain
    is a disruptive and relatively complex technology (Crosby et al., 2016; Iansiti
    and Lakhani, 2017), and this may hurts its adoption. Thus, we map to this dimension
    factors in the literature that help in alleviating the effect of the complexity
    of the technology and act as enablers for its adoption and use for supply chain
    management. These factors are: developing and harmonizing blockchain technology
    standards (Lacity, 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); establishing
    appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain platforms (Mendling et al.,
    2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); establishing rules and standards
    for interoperability between blockchains and between blockchains and other systems
    (Mendling et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). 3.1.5. External pressure External
    pressure to adopt the innovation refers to the influences originating from the
    organization''s environment (Iacovou et al., 1995). Indeed, the influence exerted
    by external parties may be determinant in the adoption of inter-organizational
    information technologies (Teo et al., 2003). In our theoretical model for blockchain
    adoption within the context of supply chain management, this dimension comprises
    pressures that originate from the organization''s environment as well as encouraging
    factors in this environment. Building on this and on findings in the extant literature,
    we map the following enablers to the external pressure category: customer interest
    in the traceability information and other product-related data on the blockchain
    (Lacity, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019; van Hoek, 2019); industry-wide
    initiatives to promote blockchain technology adoption and use (Casey and Wong,
    2017; Lacity, 2018; Behnke and Janssen, 2020); establishing regulatory framework
    for using blockchain technology (Casey and Wong, 2017; Lacity, 2018; Wang et al.,
    2019; Janssen et al., 2020); and government pressure for implementing blockchain
    technology (Lacity, 2018). 3.2. Enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply
    chain Table 1 summarizes the results of the literature review we conducted to
    identify the enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Information
    in Table 1 provides the answer to our research question RQ1 and informs our model
    for blockchain adoption in the supply chain by providing a list of enablers of
    adoption organized in five catagories as per the model in Fig. 1. Table 1. Enablers
    of blockchain technology adoption in the supply chain. Category Enabler Enabler
    Name Enabler Description References Organizational Readiness E1 Technological
    capabilities To implement and use blockchain technology a firm needs to use sophisticated
    information systems for collecting, storing and communicating data. Availability
    of such systems and capabilities encourages adoption. Iansiti and Lakhani (2017);
    Behnke and Janssen (2020); Bumblauskas et al. 2019; Janssen et al. (2020) E2 Knowledge
    and expertise in using the technology Implementing blockchain technology requires
    specific and new technical expertise. The availability of such expertise in the
    firm would thus encourage the implementation of the blockchain technology. Behnke
    and Janssen (2020); Mendling et al. (2018) E3 Availability of financial resources
    Blockchain adoption and implementation requires investing in sophisticated technology
    and the availability of sufficient financial resources encourages such investment.
    Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E4 Management commitment Management
    commitment allows for devoting the necessary resources for implementing blockchain
    technology. Firm''s management also plays an important role in encouraging and
    accompanying the cultural and organizational changes that the implementation of
    the technology may require. Gunasekaran and Ngai (2008); Kouhizadeh et al., 2021;
    van Hoek, 2019 Relative Advantage E5 Integrity of data on the blockchain Blockchains
    are designed to guarantee that it is much difficult to erase or change already
    stored data. This may encourage adoption, as data is more secure and trustful.
    Casey and Wong (2017); Babich and Hilary (2020); Kouhizadeh and Sarkis (2018);
    Montecchi et al. (2019) E6 Improved data availability from multiple sources and
    supply chain members One of the main characteristics of blockchain technology
    is that it makes all the recorded data virtually continuously available for all
    the network participants. Casey and Wong (2017); Babich and Hilary (2020); van
    Hoek, 2019 E7 Lower transaction cost Blockchain allows for reducing the cost of
    transactions between supply chain members, especially due to disintermediation
    and the application of smart contracts. Kshetri (2018); Schmidt and Wagner, 2019;
    Tönnissen and Teuteberg (2020); Wamba et al. (2020) Compatibility E8 Ease in implementing
    process and organizational changes to accommodate blockchain adoption and use
    Implementing blockchain technology requires re-engineering of related processes
    to support availability of required data. Therefore, the ease in implementing
    organizational changes encourages the adoption of the technology. Mendling et
    al. (2018); Chang et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E9
    Availability of credible and accurate data from internal processes Using blockchain
    for sharing information among supply chain members requires accurate and credible
    data to be collected from their internal processes. Thus, the availability of
    such data enables the supply chain members to share it and may encourage the adoption
    of blockchain technology for this purpose. Mendling et al. (2018); Wang et al.
    (2019); Behnke and Janssen (2020); Janssen et al. (2020) E10 Cultural aspects
    related to the propensity for transparency among the supply chain members Using
    blockchain technology is usually intended to increase supply chain transparency.
    Thus, a culture of transparency among supply chain members encourages the adoption
    of this technology. Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020); Kouhizadeh et al.,
    2021 E11 Cooperation between supply chain members to agree on common rules for
    data disclosure and confidentiality issues A data disclosure policy that identifies
    the data that will be shared between the supply chain members and the rules for
    accessing the data on the blockchain is a first step towards data disclosure and
    for making it available on the blockchain. Wang et al. (2019); Behnke and Janssen
    (2020); Kouhizadeh et al., 2021 E12 Cooperation between supply chain members for
    process standardization and agreement on the type and level of details of the
    data to be shared on the blockchain To share data on blockchain, supply chain
    members need to agree on standard processes, thee types, formats, and level of
    details of the data to be shared. Casey and Wong (2017); Bumblauskas et al. 2019;
    Wang et al. (2019); Behnke and Janssen (2020); Janssen et al., 2020 E13 Cooperation
    between supply chain members to adopt common supply chain objectives from using
    the technology Agreeing on common objectives from using blockchain technology
    among the supply chain members increases the chance of adoption and use of this
    technology by them. Babich and Hilary (2020); Wang et al. (2019); Kouhizadeh et
    al., 2021 Complexity E14 Developing and harmonizing blockchain technology standards
    Blockchain protocols are not stable yet. There is also a lack of standardization
    of the technology and the format of data and interfaces with other systems. Advances
    in this regard would encourage adoption. Lacity (2018); Wang et al., 2019; Janssen
    et al. (2020) E15 Establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms To be trusted and to work efficiently, a blockchain should have an appropriate
    governance structure and clear rules for decision-making, and conflict resolution.
    Babich and Hilary (2020); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E16 Establishing
    rules and standards for interoperability between blockchains and between blockchains
    and other systems A company may be part of multiple blockchains. Thus, there is
    a need to know how these blockchains may interact with each other. Mendling et
    al. (2018); Wang et al., 2019 External Pressure E17 Customer interest in the traceability
    information and other product-related data on blockchain Interest of customers
    in traceability information and other data available on the blockchain would push
    firms and supply chains to adopt this technology for supply chain management to
    ensure data availability for customers. Lacity (2018); Kshetri (2018); Montecchi
    et al., 2019; van Hoek, 2019 E18 Industry wide initiatives to promote blockchain
    technology adoption and use Adoption of blockchain technology may be encouraged
    by initiatives to promote adoption that are taken on the level of the entire industry.
    Casey and Wong (2017); Lacity (2018); Behnke and Janssen (2020) E19 Establishing
    regulatory framework for using blockchain technology Establishing new regulations
    that are adapted to blockchain-enabled transactions may encourage adoption, as
    the current regulatory framework doesn''t not cover the transactions and the new
    business models made possible by blockchain technology. Casey and Wong (2017);
    Mendling et al. (2018); Lacity (2018); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020)
    E20 government pressure for implementing blockchain technology Government could
    adopt regulations to mandate the implementation and use of blockchain technology,
    for traceability and authentication purposes in some sectors, such as in pharmaceutical
    production. Lacity (2018) 4. Research method To evaluate the levels of influence
    of the enablers identified in Section 3 and analyze their relationships, we use
    the DEMATEL method. DEMATEL is a decision-making support tool that helps in acquiring
    the input of experts regarding complex problems, and appropriately using this
    information to improve our understanding of such problems. This tool is particularly
    adapted for studying problems in which multiple intricate factors mutually influence
    each other and contribute together to forming an overall situation (Gabus and
    Fontela, 1973). It helps in evaluating the relative importance or impact of the
    factors under consideration and establishing causal relationships between them.
    DEMATEL has been widely used for studying a variety of supply chain management-related
    topics, such as analyzing and modeling sustainability practices in supply chains
    (Gandhi et al., 2015; Govindan et al., 2011; Kaur et al.2017; Lin, 2013); modeling
    supplier selection criteria (Chang et al., 2011); analyzing enablers of supply
    chain risk mitigation (Rajesh and Ravi, 2015); and analyzing traceability implementation
    (Haleem et al., 2019). 4.1. Steps for applying DEMATEL As previously mentioned,
    DEMATEL is based on experts’ input regarding the interaction between factors related
    to a given problem (Li and Mathiyazhagan, 2018; Bai et al., 2017). Once the factors
    to be studied are identified, DEMATEL is implemented as follows. Step 1: Acquiring
    the evaluation of the factors from a panel of experts. The first step in implementing
    DEMATEL is to collect data from experts on how they think the different factors
    impact each other. For this purpose, experts are asked to make pairwise evaluations
    of the impact of factors on each other. Let be the number of factors under consideration,
    a matrix of size is formed with all these factors in the lines and in the columns.
    The experts are then asked to fill in the cells of this matrix with their evaluation
    of the influence of each factor in the lines on the different factors in the columns.
    Let be the number of experts participating to the study. Each expert (with ) will
    return a matrix that contains his evaluation ( ) regarding the influence of each
    factor ) in the lines on each factor ( ) in the columns. Note that the size of
    the matrix is , as the same factors are reported in the lines and in the columns
    of the matrix. As for the evaluations , they take numerical values that represent
    the expert''s evaluation of the influence between factors. The values on the diagonal
    of any matrix are, of course, set to zero (i. e., ) as a factor could not influence
    itself. Step 2: Computing the direct relation matrix (B). Using the output from
    Step 1, one single direct relation matrix is computed by aggregating the matrices
    using the formula in Equation (1). (1) Step 3: Computing the normalized direct
    relation matrix. In this step, the direct relation matrix is normalized as follows.
    The sum of elements in each line of the matrix is computed and the maximum sum
    ( ) is selected as in Equation (2). (2) Then, the normalized direct relation matrix
    is computed as in Equation (3). (3) Step 4: Computing the total relation matrix
    (T). The total relation matrix ( ) is computed using the normalized direct relation
    matrix as in Equation (4). (4) Step 5: Computing the total influence between factors.
    The total influence a factor (i) exerts on the other factors is computed by taking
    the sum of the elements in the corresponding row ( ) in the total relation matrix
    (T), as in Equation (5). As for the influence that a factor (j) receives from
    the other factors in the system, it is equal to the sum of the elements in the
    corresponding column ( ) in the same matrix (T). Equations (5), (6)), show how
    these two elements are computed. (5) (6) Step 6: Computing the prominence ( )
    and the net effect ( ) of the factors. Then, for each factor ( ) the overall importance
    (prominence) ( ) and the net effect ( ) are computed using the expressions in
    (7), (8). (7) (8) The prominence ( ) of a factor ( ) represents the sum of the
    influence that this factor exerts on and receives from the other factors in the
    system. The net effect ( ) of a factor ( ) represents the difference between the
    influence that this factor exerts on the other factors and the influence of the
    other factors of the system on it. At this stage, all the information regarding
    the influence of the factors is obtained and can be illustrated using diagrams
    and graphics. But a further step that allows for focusing on the significant relationships
    between the factors could be performed by discarding all the values in the matrix
    (T) that are lower than a threshold ( ). Notice that choosing a small value of
    the threshold leads to discarding very few relationships and results in complex
    diagrams between factors due to the high number of direct relations considered.
    On the other hand, a high value of the threshold ( ) could lead to discarding
    too many relations that could be interesting to consider. Given the high number
    of factors we deal with in this study, we choose to use a threshold value that
    exceeds the average of the elements in the total relation matrix (T) by one standard
    deviation. Thus, ( ) is calculated using the expression (9). (9) 4.2. Sampling
    respondents and collecting data We targeted a sample of 160 potential respondents
    who have sufficient expertise in supply chain management or information technology
    applications in supply chains. Following similar studies which are based on experts''
    opinion such as Agi and Nishant (2017), Bokrantz et al. (2017) and Wang et al.
    (2019), we used two main criteria to select potential respondents: (1) the number
    of years of experience within the field and (2) the position in the company. Thus,
    all the members of our targeted sample have at least 5 years of work experience
    in functions related to supply chain management or information technology management
    with direct linkages to supply chain processes. All the experts in our panel work
    in middle or higher management positions in their respective companies, or as
    confirmed or senior consultants. We built the targeted sample using our network
    and asked for help from the Brittany Chamber of Commerce (CCI-Bretagne), France
    to identify potential respondents. Given the emerging nature of blockchain technology
    applications in supply chain management, the respondents didn''t need to be experts
    in blockchain technology. However, in the e-mail we sent to them to ask if they
    are willing to take part to the study, they were informed that they should be
    aware of blockchain technology attributes and its current and potential use in
    supply chain management in order to fill in the questionnaire. Finally, as our
    study is not restricted to a specific sector, targeted respondents came from companies
    operating in a variety of sectors including manufacturing, distribution, service,
    and consulting. We followed a two-step process in collecting answers from respondents,
    as explained in Appendix I. In a first step, we sent e-mails to all the 160 potential
    respondents to give them a full explanation of the objective of the study and
    ask if they are willing to contribute by filling the matrix of mutual influence
    between the 20 factors. Then, an Excel file representing the evaluation matrix
    with the 20 enablers in the rows and the columns, and the evaluation grid (Table
    2) were sent to the 52 respondents who declared their willingness to take part
    to the study. Data collection took place from mid-January to mid-March 2021. In
    a limited number of cases, we had to call the respondents and give explanations
    on the way they should proceed for filling in the Excel sheet. The use of the
    Excel sheet in collecting answers helped to limit the typing errors, as the data
    was ready to be exploited directly in Excel. Out of the 52 respondents who initially
    accepted to fill in the matrix, 37 returned useable responses in which answers
    to all the questions are obtained and the Excel file is entirely completed. Table

    4 Table 3 shows the overall characteristics of these 37 respondents. From Table
    3, we notice that out of the 37 respondents, 16 work in supply chain management
    related functions, 9 in IT management with supply chain applications, 7 are CEOs
    and 5 are consultants. It is also to be noted that most of the respondents (23
    out of 37) have more than 10 years of work experience in the field of the study.

    4 More than 20 4 DEMATEL method is different from similar survey-based exercises
    for two reasons. First, the respondents are individuals with significant information
    about the phenomenon under investigation in addition to being experts in the field
    (Bai et al., 2017; Li and Mathiyazhagan, 2018). Hence, even a low number of respondents
    could provide detailed insights into the phenomenon being studied. Secondly, the
    method relies on the respondents’ critical evaluation of theoretically chosen
    factors to help the researchers establish the relative importance and mutual dependence
    of these factors. As such a small sample size is expected to help the research
    reach a level of theoretical saturation (Kamble et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018).
    It needs to be established that the generalizations that are drawn from the result
    trace themselves as much to the theory being established as to the empirical data.
    Hence, we are claiming theoretical generalization as against statistical generalization
    of the results (Jha et al., 2016). Theoretically generalized results are considered
    to be robust due to their grounding in critically evaluated theoretical paradigms
    and utilized widely in circumstances where limited access to data prohibits statistical
    generalization (Maxwell and Chmiel, 2014). 5. Analysis and results Our analysis
    started by applying Equation (1) to compute the direct relationship matrix based
    on the 37 useable responses returned by the experts. Then, we computed the normalized
    direct relation matrix (B) using Equations (2), (3)). The total relation matrix
    (T) is then computed using Equation (4). This matrix is presented in Appendix
    II. The total influence an enabler ( ) exerts on and receives from the other enablers
    in the system, respectively ( ) and ( ), are computed using Equations (5), (6).
    Then, the levels of importance (prominence) (R + C) and the net effect (R–C) of
    the enablers are computed by applying Equations (7), (8). Results obtained from
    this step are shown in Table 4. Based on information in Table 4, we order the
    20 enablers according to their prominence scores and graphically depict these
    scores in Fig. 2. Table 4. Prominence and net effect of the enablers. Category

    image Fig. 2. Prominence levels of the enablers. Note that the prominence of an
    enabler indicates its overall importance in the system (Bai et al., 2017; Govindan
    et al., 2015). Thus, information in Table 4 and Fig. 2 answers the second research
    question in this study (RQ2) by providing an evaluation of the level of importance
    of the various enablers with regards to the adoption decision. From Table 4 and
    Fig. 2, we notice that lowering transaction cost (E7) is the most prominent enabler,
    followed by customer interest in the traceability information and other product-related
    data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4), establishing regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (E19) and cooperation between supply
    chain members for process standardization and agreement on the type and level
    of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), respectively. On
    the other hand, enablers that have the lowest prominence scores are the availability
    of financial resources (E3), Ease in implementing process and organizational changes
    (E8), the government pressure (E20), the Technological capabilities (E1) and the
    knowledge and expertise in using the technology (E2). While the prominence score
    indicates the overall importance of an enabler, the net effect informs us if this
    enabler should be categorized as a cause or as an effect enabler. Cause enablers
    have positive net effect scores, which indicate that they exert more impact on
    the other enablers in the system than they are impacted by them. Therefore, these
    enablers may be addressed relatively independently of the situation of the other
    enablers, and potentially benefit the whole system. By contrast, effect enablers
    are those enablers with negative net effect scores, indicating that they are more
    impacted by the other enablers of the system than they exert impact on them. Fig.
    3 position the 20 enablers of blockchain adoption under investigation relative
    to the two dimensions: prominence and net effect. The vertical axis in Fig. 3
    represents the prominence. It is graduated from 0.6 to 3.0 to accommodate the
    values that we had in our analysis. The horizontal axis represents the net effect,
    and it ranges from −1.4 to +1.4 with negative and positive values indicating effect
    and cause enablers, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (244KB) Download

    4 and Fig. 3, we notice that half of the 20 enablers of blockchain adoption considered
    in our study are cause enablers and half of them are effect enablers. We also
    notice that among the five most prominent enablers, customer interest in the traceability
    information and other product-related data on blockchain (E17) and establishing
    regulatory framework for using blockchain technology (E19) are cause enablers,
    while lower transaction cost (E7), management commitment (E4), and cooperation
    between supply chain members for process standardization and agreement on the
    type and level of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12) are
    effect ones. 6. Discussion and implications In this section, we further analyze
    and discuss the results obtained in the previous section (Section 5). We do this
    first by considering the prominence of the enablers by category of enablers as
    per the theoretical model presented in Section 3. Then, we focus on the most eminent
    enablers and analyze their relationships and interactions with the rest of the
    system. Subsequently, we use the result of our analysis to elaborate implications
    and managerial insights. 6.1. Prominence by category of enablers Taking a categorical
    construct level view of the enablers, Table 5 shows the average prominence scores
    computed for each category of enablers that compose the theoretical model described
    in Section 3. Categories in this table are ordered according to the average prominence
    of the enablers that compose them. Table 5. Prominence and net effect of the categories
    of enablers. Category Average Prominence Relative Advantage 2.231 External Pressure
    2.080 Compatibility 2.018 Complexity 1.853 Organizational Readiness 1.481 From
    Table 5, we notice that relative advantage and external pressure have the highest
    average prominence values, respectively, while organizational readiness has the
    lowest average prominence value. Thus, blockchain adoption in the supply chain
    is mainly influenced by the benefits (relative advantage) that this technology
    offers in comparison with other existing technologies (integrity of data, improved
    data availability and lower transaction costs), followed by the external pressure
    for adoption exerted by customers and public authorities, in particular. To the
    opposite, organizational readiness seems to have a limited impact on the adoption
    decision. This last result suggests that adoption decision may be taken regardless
    of the organizational readiness, so that blockchain would often be the driver
    of wider organizational transformation. This result finds support in the extant
    literature of digital transformation that states that organizational digitalization
    would be a result of major technological adoption (Andriole et al., 2017; Hartley
    and Sawaya, 2019). 6.2. Prominence and relationships between enablers Lower transaction
    cost (E7), customer interest in the traceability information and other product-related
    data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4), establishing regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (E19) and cooperation between supply
    chain members for process standardization and agreement on the type and level
    of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12) are top five prominent
    enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain, as evidenced in Table 4.
    A careful look in the total relation matrix (T) enables a full understanding of
    the impact of these enablers by uncovering their interactions with the rest of
    the system. However, due to the big number of enablers investigated in this study,
    we analyze relationships and interactions among them and answer the third research
    question of the study (RQ3) by focusing on the meaningful relationships in the
    total relation matrix (T). To do this, we apply a threshold so that only the values
    in the total relation matrix (T) that are higher than the threshold would be considered.
    Applying a threshold and focusing on the most significant relationships among
    factors is a common practice in DEMATEL studies (Kouhizadeh et al., 2021; Fu et
    al., 2012). Table 6 shows the remaining values from the total relation matrix
    (T) after applying the threshold defined in Equation (9). Table 6. The most significant
    relation coefficients between enablers. Empty Cell Impacted enablers E4 E6 E7

    Data in Table 6 shows that the capacity of blockchain to lower transaction cost
    that represent the most eminent enabler (E7) is significantly impacted by a number
    of enablers including the existence of a regulatory framework (E19), standards
    for interoperability (E16) and appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    (E15), in addition to the integrity of data on the blockchain (E5). This suggests
    that supply chain professionals believe that grasping the benefit of lower transaction
    const due to blockchain adoption in the supply chain is subject to the establishment
    of appropriate conditions for using the technology: an appropriate regulatory
    framework, operability standards and governance rules. In its turn, E7 seems to
    significantly enhance the management commitment (F4) and promote the availability
    of credible and accurate data from internal processes (E9). As for the second
    most prominent enabler: customer interest in the traceability information and
    other product-related data on blockchain (E17), data in Table 6 shows that this
    enabler exerts a significant impact on management commitment (E4), data availability
    from internal firm''s processes (E9) as well as from all the participants in the
    blockchain (E6). It also appears that E17 triggers four cooperation-related enablers
    at the supply chain level. These are cooperation between supply chain members
    to agree on: common rules for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (E11),
    process standardization and the type and level of details of the data to be shared
    on the blockchain (E12), common supply chain objectives from using the technology
    (E13) in addition to establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms (E15). The high-level impact of E17 on multiple other enablers as demonstrated
    above suggests that a big portion of the motivation for adopting blockchain technology
    in the supply chain is related to customers'' requirements regarding traceability
    and other product-related data. Management commitment (E4) is identified as the
    third most prominent enabler for blockchain adoption in the supply chain. In-depth
    examination of the role of this enabler using information in Table 6 shows that
    management commitment acts as a bearing point in the system. It appears as an
    effect enabler leveraged, mainly, by the integrity of data on blockchain (E5),
    the potential for lowering transaction cost (E7), The cultural propensity for
    transparency (E10), the existence of rules for interoperability (E16), the customer
    interest in the information on blockchain (E17), and the existence of a regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (F19). On its turn, management commitment
    significantly contributes to enhancing the availability of credible and accurate
    data from internal processes (E9) and the cooperation between supply chain members
    to agree on common rules for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (E11),
    process standardization, type and level of details of the data to be shared on
    the blockchain (E12), and common supply chain objectives from using the technology
    (E13). Our results also show that establishing regulatory framework for using
    blockchain technology (E19) is an important cause enabler ranked fourth in prominence.
    It significantly enhances management commitment (E4), the availability of data
    from firm''s internal processes (E9) and from various other sources and supply
    chain members (E6), in addition to supporting reduction of transaction costs (E7).
    E19 also provides a favorable legal environment for cooperation between supply
    chain members to agree on common objectives, rules and standards related to sharing
    data on blockchain, as demonstrated by the significant effect of this enabler
    on E11, E12, E13 and E15. Like management commitment at the firm''s level, cooperation
    at the supply chain level seems to be very important for blockchain adoption.
    This is highlighted by the ranking of the cooperation between supply chain members
    for process standardization and agreement on the type and level of details of
    the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), ranked fifth in prominence. Data
    in Table 6 shows that this enabler is significantly impacted by customer interest
    in product traceability (E17), the cultural propensity for transparency in the
    supply chain (E10), the establishment of regulatory framework for using blockchain
    technology (E19), the existence of rules for interoperability (E16) and the integrity
    of data on blockchain (E5). Data in Table 6 also shows that the two other enablers
    related to the cooperation between supply chain members (E11) and (E13) are also
    significantly impacted by the same enablers as (E12). Thus, our findings suggest
    that having supply chain members cooperating for adopting blockchain in the supply
    chain is subject to the customer interest in product traceability, the cultural
    propensity for transparency in the supply chain, the existence of regulatory framework
    for using blockchain technology and the existence of rules for interoperability.
    6.3. Implications and managerial insights Our results demonstrate that firm''s
    management commitment and cooperation between supply chain partners on various
    aspects related to data sharing, confidentiality and system governance are both
    of primary importance for adopting blockchain technology in the supply chain.
    Findings also reveal that management commitment and cooperation between supply
    chain members for blockchain adoption are mainly triggered and supported by factors
    that may be addressed by extending efforts in three main directions. First, for
    raising awareness among consumers and firms'' managers about the usefulness of
    the availability of product data and the capability of blockchain to provide such
    data availability. Second, for developing and harmonizing the technology standards,
    in addition to enhancing blockchain interoperability. Third, for preparing a regulatory
    environment that favors the adoption and use of the technology. Consumers are
    a primary source of pressure on firms. Our findings show that consumer interest
    in product-related data, including traceability, encourages firms’ managers to
    adopt the blockchain technology and enhances collaboration among supply chain
    partners for data sharing on blockchain. This enabler may be addressed by conducting
    awareness campaigns to sensitize consumers on the usefulness of data that may
    be provided using blockchain. Such awareness campaigns may be conducted by consumers
    associations, NGOs or industry representative bodies. It may concern a wide range
    of data related to products as well as production and supply chain processes.
    For instance, consumers'' awareness about sustainability aspects in production
    motivates them to put more pressure for getting detailed and accurate information
    from all supply chain members regarding the social and environmental practices.
    Similarly, campaigns against fraud and counterfeit products in fashion and luxury
    industries encourage consumers to be more demanding for extensive and tamper-proof
    product information. In addition to consumers, awareness campaigns may also target
    firms upper and middle management to demonstrate the various advantages of blockchain
    in comparison with other technologies, especially its potential to lower the cost
    of transactions, which appears to be an impactful enabler of blockchain adoption
    in the supply chain. Actions of industry representative bodies, consulting firms
    and technology solutions promotors are crucial in this regard. Concretely, they
    may organize seminars, meetings, and workshops where new blockchain-enabled business
    models can be discussed and the value proposition of the technology as a platform
    for sharing tamper-proof information and reducing the costs of transactions can
    be demonstrated and clarified for managers. Consortiums or industry representative
    bodies may also conduct, or offer support to, blockchain applications proof of
    concept (Lacity, 2018), which may give confidence in the new technology and constitute
    a first step towards implementing real solutions. Companies may also conduct industry
    specific collective initiatives to develop and agree on the best practices and
    governance structure for blockchain technology (Casey and Wong, 2017; Behnke and
    Janssen, 2020). Our results also point out the importance of developing universal
    standards for blockchain technology, improving the interoperability between different
    blockchains and with firms'' information systems and establishing appropriate
    and clear governance rules. Thus, solutions providers need to work on adopting
    universal standards for this technology (Janssen et al., 2020) and enhancing interoperability
    between different blockchains, as well as between blockchain and firms'' information
    systems (Wang et al., 2019). Solutions providers may also work with legislators
    and user communities to build appropriate governance structures that define the
    rights and obligations of the different parties involved in blockchain management
    and use and determine the decision-making rules and the procedures for preventing
    information misuse and solving conflicts (Babich and Hilary, 2020). Finally, results
    demonstrate that establishing regulatory framework for using blockchain technology
    is critical with regard to adoption. This suggests that legislators are also required
    to put efforts to create new regulations or adapt the existing ones to support
    blockchain-enabled business models and exchange processes. Indeed, it is widely
    admitted that regulations related to data security and privacy impact the blockchain
    potential use (Lacity, 2018; Wang et al., 2019) and making new regulations or
    changing existing ones may be necessary to support the adoption of this technology.
    7. Limitations and conclusion The limitations to our study are mainly related
    to the respondents'' sample. Our respondents come exclusively from France. This
    may introduce a bias in the results. Future research work may thus be conducted
    in another country, a developing economy for example. Results may then be compared
    with ours for further insights. Special consideration may be given to factors
    like government pressure in these circumstances as presence (or absence) of legislative
    frameworks can alter the scope and possibility of blockchain adoption significantly
    in different geographies. As previously indicated, the transaction cost considered
    in our study refers to the cost of individual transactions. This cost is thus
    different from the overall cost of ownership that should also include the implementation
    cost. Future research may address this issue. Additionally, adopting a theory-driven
    approach, we have focused on identifying a comprehensive list of enablers and
    their inter-relationships as identified from the established theoretical literature.
    Given the emergent nature of technology, a grounded theoretic approach has the
    potential to bring to light new factors that could be explored in subsequent studies.
    However, within its limitations, this study makes a significant contribution to
    extant literature on blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Indeed, our work
    is one of the first empirical studies that attempt to analyze and understand blockchain
    adoption in the supply chain. The findings allowed to uncover the role of 20 enablers
    of blockchain adoption in the supply chain with regard to the adoption decision
    and to establish a series of insights on how to encourage such decision. We found
    that external pressure and relative advantage are the two most prominent categories
    of enablers that impact blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Findings also
    suggest that raising awareness among customers and supply chain professionals
    about the advantages of blockchain over existing technologies is key for stimulating
    its adoption. Our study also reveals that to motivate blockchain adoption in supply
    chains, it is crucial to develop technology standards, provide interoperability
    among different blockchains or between blockchains and firms’ systems, and adapt
    laws and regulations to support blockchain-enabled business models and exchange
    processes. Appendix I. Description of the survey procedure and the questionnaire
    Potential respondents were first approached by e-mail. In a first e-mail, we gave
    potential respondents an explanation of the survey objectives and asked them if
    they were willing to take part to it. The questionnaire was then sent by e-mail
    only to those respondents who accepted to take part to the survey. This second
    e-mail contained a breif reminder of the objectives of the study and two attached
    files: a Word file with the questions and an Excel file that contained the direct
    relation matrix that the respondent should fill in. The questionnaire in the Word
    file was organized in two parts as follows: Part 1 This part contained questions
    with the objective of acquiring the following information: - The size of the company.
    - The sector in which the company is operating. - The department the respondent
    works in. - The position of the respondent in the company. - The number of years
    of experience of the respondent in the current function. - The total number of
    years of experience the respondent has in supply chain or IT related activities.
    Part 2 This part contained one single question with the objective of acquiring
    the respondent''s evaluation of the interdependencies among the twenty enablers.
    The respondent was asked to fill in each cell of the matrix in the Excel file
    by one of the following numbers: 0 if he thinks that there is no impact of the
    factor in the line on the factor in the column of the cell 1 if he thinks that
    there is a low impact of the factor in the line on the factor in the column of
    the cell 2 if he thinks that there is a moderate impact of the factor in the line
    on the factor in the column of the cell 3 if he thinks that there is a high impact
    of the factor in the line on the factor in the column of the cell 4 if he thinks
    that there is a Very High impact of the factor in the line on the factor in the
    column of the cell NB1: The list of the 20 enablers and their definitions were
    supplied in an appendix to the questionnaire. NB2: As one factor could not impact
    itself, we already put “0” in the diagonal. NB3: The Excel file contained a 20
    × 20 with all the enablers listed in the columns and in the lines. To avoid confusion
    and filling errors, A note was incorporated in each cell in the table to indicate
    what the cell should contain. The note gave the full names of the impacting enabler
    in the line of the cell and the impacted enabler in the column. NB4: Analysis
    considered only responses in which answers to all the questions are obtained and
    the Excel file is entirely completed. Appendix II. Total Relation Matrix Empty

    \ emissions are categorised as Embodied Carbon (EC) occurring in the production\n\
    phase and Operational Carbon (OC) occurring in the operational phase of buildings.\
    \ The current\nfocus on producing zero-carbon buildings, emphasises reducing OC\
    \ and ignores the importance of\nreducing EC emissions. This study focuses on\
    \ EC. Methods available in EC estimating currently\nproduce estimates that often\
    \ do not complement each other. This makes it important to develop\na robust and\
    \ accurate methodology for estimating EC. Blockchain is an emerging technology\
    \ that\nhas signiﬁcant potential for transaction processing in supply chains.\
    \ The construction industry\nbeing the second least digitalised industry, the\
    \ adoption of innovative technologies is predominantly\nimportant. This paper\
    \ explores the potential application of blockchain for accurate estimation of\n\
    EC in construction supply chains. A detailed literature review and expert interviews\
    \ revealed\nthat, compared to traditional information systems, blockchain systems\
    \ could eliminate issues in EC\nestimating highlighting its potential credible\
    \ application for EC estimating. Scalability was identiﬁed\nas a feature that\
    \ was lacking in a blockchain system, however, for EC estimating, its impact was\n\
    identiﬁed as minimal. It will be diﬃcult to generalise the ﬁndings of the study\
    \ due to interview based\nqualitative methodology adopted in this study along\
    \ with the fact that blockchain is an emerging and\nfairly new technology. However,\
    \ a similar process could be followed by other studies to compare\nblockchain\
    \ with traditional information systems, to evaluate the suitability of blockchain\
    \ technology\nto develop prototype systems.\nKeywords: blockchain; construction\

    \ system\n1. Introduction\nBlockchain, being an emerging technology that resulted\
    \ through Industry 4.0, has drawn\nconsiderable interest from various start-ups,\
    \ technology developers, enterprises, national governments,\nand the academic\
    \ community [1]. Manglekar and Dinesha [2] identiﬁed blockchain as a distributed,\n\
    decentralised ledger that stores all transactions.\nIn addition, it provides a\
    \ distributed shared\ndatabase and a computational infrastructure, which prevents\
    \ the tampering and revision of data [3].\nBefore approving a transaction, blockchain\
    \ performs an autonomous veriﬁcation through the\nconsensus algorithms to ensure\
    \ security, prevent false transactions being recorded, and avoid double\nspending\
    \ [4]. It was originally designed as a decentralised network for exchanging digital\
    \ money.\nBlockchain technology is not only used for the transfer of digital money,\
    \ but lately it has been\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/buildings10080140\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/buildings\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 13\nadopted for\
    \ various other applications. According to Walport [5], blockchain as a technology\
    \ has\nthe capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to a wide range of services\
    \ while revolutionising the\nindustries to reform ﬁnancial markets, supply chains,\
    \ consumer and business-to-business services,\nand publicly-held registers.\n\
    Blockchain technology can be applied to many areas of the construction industry\
    \ including\nConstruction Supply Chains (CSCs), building information modelling,\
    \ design management,\nsustainability and waste management, property and land titles,\
    \ asset management, and maintenance\namong others [6–10]. However, construction\
    \ industry is having diﬃculties embracing digitalisation\ndue to various reasons\
    \ such as fragmentation, lack of replication, transience, and decentralisation\n\
    among others [11]. According to Perera, et al. [10] and Agarwal, et al. [12],\
    \ the construction industry\nis the second least digitalised industry, which had\
    \ just managed to surpass the lowest digitalised\nindustry, agriculture. It is\
    \ predominantly important to adapt innovative technologies to improve\nproductivity\
    \ and performance in construction. Embodied Carbon (EC) estimating in CSCs using\n\
    blockchain has been identiﬁed as a credible application of blockchain [13]. This\
    \ study explores the\nimportance of using a blockchain system compared to a traditional\
    \ system to estimate EC in CSCs.\nInitially, the paper discusses fundamental principles\
    \ on blockchain highlighting layers of blockchain\narchitecture, followed by discussing\
    \ the importance of carbon estimating and current issues in carbon\nestimating.\
    \ Subsequently, an elaborated analysis was carried out to explore the suitability\
    \ of using a\nblockchain system to estimate EC rather than using a traditional\
    \ information system, by considering the\nsalient features of blockchain such\
    \ as decentralisation, anonymity, security, immutability, and so forth.\nA traditional\
    \ information system is “a system in which human participants and/or machines\
    \ carry\nout processes using information, technology, and other resources to produce\
    \ informational products\nand/or services for internal or external customers”\
    \ [14] (p. 451). For example, diﬀerent databases\nand IT-based tools used for\
    \ estimating EC are classiﬁed as traditional information systems in this\nresearch.\
    \ Blockchain is a new technology that has added features and, therefore, is distinguished\
    \ from\nthe traditional information systems.\n1.1. Blockchain\nA blockchain is\
    \ a shared and distributed database that contains a continuously expanding log\n\
    of transactions that is stored according to a chronological order [1]. Blockchain\
    \ is a decentralised\ntransaction ledger that acts as part of a large computing\
    \ architecture, which includes many other\nfunctions related to storage, communication,\
    \ ﬁle serving, and archives [15]. According to Li [16] (p. 278),\n“blockchain\
    \ is an integrated technology, which includes Hash, asymmetric encryption, workload\
    \ proof,\nMerkel tree, timestamp, and peer-to-peer network are not new technologies,\
    \ but with new ideas to\ncombine them cleverly”. The security and accuracy of\
    \ the data stored in the ledger are maintained\ncryptographically through the\
    \ use of public and private keys, and signatures to control “who can do\nwhat”\
    \ within the shared ledger [5].\nBlockchain architecture consists of four main\
    \ layers: the application layer, contract layer, consensus\nlayer, and network\
    \ layer as illustrated in Figure 1. The network layer is the lowest level, which\
    \ generates,\nvalidates, and stores the data and information in the blockchain\
    \ [17]. The peer-to-peer network consists\nof multiple nodes that could act as\
    \ public (permission-less), private (permissioned), or a consortium,\nbased on\
    \ the arrangement and limitations of access to data. The consensus and contract\
    \ layers act\nas the intermediary level between lower and upper levels. The consensus\
    \ layer contains protocols\nthat contribute to appending a block to the blockchain\
    \ [18]. There are several consensus mechanisms\navailable, such as proof of work,\
    \ proof of stake, delegated proof of stake, and proof of importance\namong others,\
    \ which have been used in various blockchain platforms considering the requirements\
    \ of\nthe platform and characteristics of the consensus mechanism. Though the\
    \ consensus mechanism, proof\nof work consumes massive amount of energy, other\
    \ consensus mechanisms such as proof of stake,\ndelegated proof of stake among\
    \ others are comparatively energy eﬃcient. Therefore, it is recommended\nthat\
    \ energy eﬃciency be considered for selecting the blockchain platform. The contract\
    \ layer includes\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n3 of 13\nsmart contracts and incentive\
    \ mechanism that enables ﬂexible programming and operational data\nfunctions for\
    \ the blockchain system [17]. The application layer contains classes of the blockchain\n\
    applications [18] related to various sectors, for example, ﬁnance (cryptocurrencies\
    \ and FinTechs),\nsupply chain management [19], energy trading, and asset management\
    \ among others.\nBuildings 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 13 \nvarious sectors,\
    \ for example, finance (cryptocurrencies and FinTechs), supply chain management\
    \ \n[19], energy trading, and asset management among others. \nApplication Layer\n\
    Consensus Layer\nNetwork Layer\nContract Layer\n \nFigure 1. Layers of blockchain\
    \ architecture. Adapted from Dinh, et al. [18] and Lu [17]. \nInitially Blockchain\
    \ 1.0 was introduced to securely validate and store information of \ntransactions,\
    \ which was populated as cryptocurrencies [20]. Subsequently Swan [15] identified\
    \ the \nusage of Blockchain 2.0 for economic, market and financial applications\
    \ such as stocks, bonds, smart \nproperty, and smart contracts, whereas Blockchain\
    \ 3.0 was used for applications beyond currency, \nfinance, and markets, particularly\
    \ related to the government, health, science, and art among others. \nBlockchain\
    \ has the potential to be considered for various energy related applications such\
    \ as energy \ntrading [1], energy management, carbon trading [13], and carbon\
    \ offsets among others. Similarly, a \ndecentralised accounting process used in\
    \ blockchains, can be applied for the purpose of accounting \nEC in CSCs of projects.\
    \ \n1.2. Embodied Carbon Estimating \nCarbon emissions can occur as Operational\
    \ Carbon (OC) and EC emissions. OC refers to carbon \nemissions that occur during\
    \ the operational phase of a building [21], while EC emissions occur during \n\
    the production process of a product/service [22]. The novel trend of reducing\
    \ OC in typical projects \nto deliver more energy efficient buildings known as\
    \ zero-carbon projects, has led to the remaining \nEC component to becoming almost\
    \ 100%. As a result, estimating and reducing EC emissions of \nbuildings has become\
    \ an increasingly vital topic internationally and domestically. EC estimating\
    \ can \nbe carried out using various tools such as the CapIT estimator, Building\
    \ Research Establishment \n(BRE) calculator, Carbon Footprint Calculator for Construction\
    \ Projects (CFCCP), French \nDevelopment Agency (AFD) tool, GaBi software, SimaPro,\
    \ eToolLCD, Embodied Carbon Explorer \n(ECE) tool, The Footprint Calculator and\
    \ databases such as Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE), \nBlackbook, Waste Reduction\
    \ Action Plan (WRAP), Ecoinvent, Australian Life Cycle Inventory \n(AusLCI), Environmental\
    \ Performance in Construction (EPiC), and The GreenBook 2010 among \nothers [23],\
    \ whereas a summary of these EC estimating tools and databases has been illustrated\
    \ in \nTable 1. \nFigure 1. Layers of blockchain architecture. Adapted from Dinh,\

    \ in\nthe construction industry [45,46]. However, Sinha, et al. [47] found that\
    \ when estimating carbon using\nthe tools, GaBi and SimaPro, even after using\
    \ same materials, similar origins and similar technology,\nthe models had produced\
    \ diﬀerent results as the considered assumptions, boundaries among others,\nvary\
    \ dependent on the estimator.\nSimilarly, Elhag [45] declared that in carbon accounting\
    \ and\nmeasurement many inaccuracies exist due to the issues associated with scope,\
    \ data representativeness,\ntendency to use generic data and so forth. In addition\
    \ to that, Rodrigo, et al. [23] identiﬁed many\nother issues in the current EC\
    \ estimating databases and tools, for example, usage of diﬀerent system\nboundaries,\
    \ diﬀerent geographical locations, lack of standardisation, lack of data on new\
    \ products,\nincomplete data, assumptions, and lack of transparency. Subsequently,\
    \ the authors introduced a new\nmethodology for estimating EC in CSCs using the\
    \ value chain concept and blockchain technology that\ncould eliminate these identiﬁed\
    \ issues. As the next step, this paper investigates the importance of\nusing a\
    \ blockchain system to estimate EC instead of a traditional information system.\n\
    2. Research Methodology\nThe aim of this study was to explore the potential application\
    \ of using a blockchain system in\nestimating EC in CSCs by comparing and contrasting\
    \ the salient features of blockchain technology\nagainst a traditional information\
    \ system. Initially a traditional literature review was carried out to\nidentify\
    \ the fundamentals and salient features of blockchain, followed by three expert\
    \ interviews\nto obtain experts’ opinions and validate the literature ﬁndings\
    \ while investigating the possibility of\nusing blockchain for estimating EC.\
    \ All experts were senior consultants who had more than 13 years\nof experience\
    \ in Information Technology (IT) and more than 4 years of experience in distributed\n\
    systems and blockchain technology, especially on smart contract development and\
    \ deployment. Due to\nthe limited number of expert interviews that were carried\
    \ out, the ﬁndings of the study cannot be\ngeneralised. However, as blockchain\
    \ is an emerging technology that was introduced only in 2008\nand further due\
    \ to limitations of the study, especially related to time constraints, knowledge\
    \ and\nexperience of experts in blockchain among others, these experts were selected\
    \ through convenience\nsampling and data was collected through semi-structured\
    \ interviews. In order to reduce biasness in\nthese interviews, interviewees were\
    \ given the freedom to respond on traditional information systems\nvs. blockchain\
    \ systems based on its features without discussing the literature ﬁndings in advance.\n\
    Subsequently, the literature ﬁndings were provided and veriﬁed whether their responses\
    \ would change.\nThe ﬁndings of the literature review and expert interviews have\
    \ been discussed in the following section.\n3. Research Findings and Discussion\n\
    The detailed literature review carried out assisted in identifying the salient\
    \ features of blockchain;\ndecentralisation, anonymity, security, immutability,\
    \ auditability, veracity, transparency, disintermediation,\ntrust, and scalability\
    \ (See Table 2). There was lack of research work that had carried out a comprehensive\n\
    comparison between the salient features of a blockchain system against a traditional\
    \ information system.\nTherefore, the researcher carried out a comparison between\
    \ a traditional information system and a\nblockchain system over the pros and\
    \ cons to decide on the suitability of blockchain to be used for EC\nestimating\
    \ as depicted in the last two columns in Table 2. The comparison was carried out\
    \ as a qualitative\nstudy based on available literature sources; as a result,\
    \ the terminology, no, low, medium, and high\nwere used to compare the salient\
    \ features. These findings were validated through expert interviews as\ndiscussed\
    \ in the latter part of this section.\nThe overall summary of Table 2 reveals\
    \ that though blockchain supports most of the features\nlisted, traditional information\
    \ systems would either not accommodate most of them or else would be\naccommodating\
    \ in a comparatively lesser portion. An EC estimating system requires one to produce\n\
    an accurate EC estimate (accuracy), secure EC data ensuring that data is not tampered\
    \ with (security),\na transparent EC estimating method which shows the EC contributors\
    \ and the supply chains without\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n6 of 13\nrevealing conﬁdential\
    \ data (transparency), remove the involvement of a third party to estimate EC\n\
    (disintermediation), and so forth. Hence, at a glance, a blockchain system is\
    \ ideal for EC estimating.\nIn addition, all experts agreed with the ﬁndings of\
    \ Table 2 and highlighted that compared to a traditional\nsystem, a blockchain\
    \ system is more suitable to estimate EC in CSCs. However, for further clariﬁcation,\n\
    each feature was considered, and experts’ opinions were obtained to understand\
    \ which system is most\nsuitable for carbon estimating in CSCs.\nTable 2. Comparison\

    \ traditional information system consists of a centralised approach where\neverything\
    \ is controlled by a single point along with a central database that stores the\
    \ data [54].\nAccording to Tan, et al. [55], single point of contact provides\
    \ eﬀective management of services.\nHowever, interviewees B and C opined that\
    \ a traditional information system being centralised,\narises few disadvantages,\
    \ such as increased dependence, open to vulnerability, low auditability,\ntrust\
    \ issues, etc. In order to mitigate such issues while providing the same beneﬁts\
    \ of a centralised\nsystem, decentralised blockchain technology has been introduced\
    \ [56]. In an EC estimating\nblockchain system, a distributed ledger that contains\
    \ all the EC transaction records are shared\namong all the nodes in a peer-to-peer\
    \ network. In order to record a new EC transaction or supersede\nan existing EC\
    \ transaction record stored in a distributed ledger to make a change, generally\
    \ the\nconsent/validation by majority of the nodes is required. Hence, the peer-to-peer\
    \ network makes it\nextremely diﬃcult to tamper with data stored in a blockchain.\
    \ The decentralisation feature of\nblockchain provides a tamper-proof data storage\
    \ mechanism fulﬁlling one of the utmost essential\nfeatures that is required to\
    \ use blockchain for EC estimating in CSCs.\n2.\nAnonymity—A centralised system\
    \ as well as a blockchain system can maintain anonymity;\nhowever, the anonymity\
    \ level in a blockchain is quite high. A blockchain system protects\nthe identity\
    \ of the user by maintaining anonymity or pseudonymity. In order to carry out\n\
    transactions in a blockchain based EC estimating system, each user will have a\
    \ public key and\na private key, which comprise of large integer numbers, but\
    \ since these numbers are so large,\nthey are usually represented using a separate\
    \ Wallet Import Format (WIF) consisting of letters\nand numbers [57]. Neither\
    \ the private key nor the public key discloses the identity of the user\nby any\
    \ means. The user of an EC estimating blockchain system can use his public key\
    \ to prove\nhis identity, thus, blockchain enables pseudonymity eﬀectively. Moreover,\
    \ interviewee A added,\n“unlike a traditional information system that could be\
    \ hacked to reveal the encrypted information\nwhere anonymity can be at stake,\
    \ a blockchain system is considered as almost impossible to\nhack as the public\
    \ key is too complicated for a hacker to decrypt and recover the user details”.\n\
    In EC estimating, it is quite important to maintain anonymity of the EC contributors\
    \ as well as\nother conﬁdential information. Hence, a blockchain system is more\
    \ suitable for recording\nEC transactions.\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 13\n\
    3.\nSecurity—The centralised system as well as a blockchain system maintains security\
    \ through\nauthentication limitations to control users’ access to the systems;\
    \ however, comparatively,\na blockchain system has a higher level of security.\
    \ According to Heeks [58] (p. 10), “centralised\ninformation systems make organisations\
    \ more dependent and more vulnerable for a number of\nreasons such as greater\
    \ numbers of staﬀ relying on single information systems; greater reliance\non\
    \ a few key staﬀ who plan, develop and run those systems; greater technical complexity\
    \ that\nmakes problems harder to diagnose; and greater potential impact of data\
    \ security breaches”. In a\ncentralised system there is a possibility to be hacked\
    \ and as the system is centralised, a change\nin one location is suﬃcient to aﬀect\
    \ the entire system. However, in a blockchain, data is stored\nin cryptographically-linked\
    \ blocks as a ledger and a copy of the ledger is shared among all the\nnodes.\
    \ Therefore, for a hacker to change the data stored in a blockchain system, the\
    \ respective\nhash of that block needs to be changed. Subsequently, the hacker\
    \ has to change the hashes\nin the entire chain between the tampered block and\
    \ the latest block [59]. On the other hand,\nmore than 50% of the ledgers need\
    \ to be replicated within a short period of time for a successful\nattack to be\
    \ completed, which is extremely diﬃcult. According to interviewee A’s point of\n\
    view, “security demarcates the combination of conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability”.\
    \ In a\nblockchain-based EC estimating system, due to decentralisation, the conﬁdentiality\
    \ of data is at\nstake. However, as EC data are not extremely sensitive or conﬁdential,\
    \ this does not hinder the\ntendency of using blockchain for EC estimating. Data\
    \ integrity also plays an important role and\nit can be achieved easily through\
    \ blockchain due to immutability and decentralisation. EC data\nhas to be available\
    \ and accessible to the respective stakeholders involved in a project and data\n\
    can be easily accessed due to transparency and due to the distributed ledger being\
    \ shared with\nall nodes. Depending on the requirements of the system, the access\
    \ can be controlled through\nauthentication; however, for anyone who has access\
    \ to the system, the EC data will be available\nat his/her ﬁngertip. Interviewee\
    \ B emphasised that “data integrity and availability of information\nwhenever\
    \ required, is essential for a blockchain-based EC estimating system”. In summary,\n\
    though conﬁdentiality is less in a decentralised distributed ledger platform,\
    \ data integrity and\navailability could be achieved well in a blockchain system.\
    \ Hence, a blockchain system has more\nsecurity compared to a traditional information\
    \ system, making it a better option for EC estimating\nin CSCs.\n4.\nImmutability—A\
    \ centralised system is quite vulnerable due to its single point of control [58].\n\
    Hence, if the centralised database is hacked, data can be tampered quite easily\
    \ aﬀecting the\nentire system. Additionally, interviewee A stated that “in a centralised\
    \ system, data life is totally\ndepending on a single organisation who is mainlining\
    \ the system. However, in a blockchain\nsystem, it is extremely diﬃcult to attack\
    \ and tamper with its data. Therefore, data recorded\nin a blockchain is considered\
    \ as immutable”. Immutability can be disadvantageous in certain\noccasions. If\
    \ a transaction record is entered in a centralised system, it can be changed quite\
    \ easily\nunlike a blockchain system, the transaction record will be superseded\
    \ by the new transaction\nrecord and everything will be recorded in the ledger\
    \ as data in blockchain is immutable [60].\nThe existing EC estimating tools such\
    \ as GaBi, SimaPro, Athena, etc., that are used to estimate\nEC are controlled\
    \ by respective organisations. If a certain organisation decides to get rid of\
    \ the\ntool, all EC calculations carried out using this tool will be at stake.\
    \ However, the EC transactions\nrecorded in the blockchain-based EC system will\
    \ remain eternal throughout the life span of data\nas a result of immutability.\n\
    5.\nAuditability—A traditional information system and a blockchain system provide\
    \ auditability.\nHowever, auditing related to an information system is conducted\
    \ by third party personnel\nto reduce errors and bias [61]. Thus, the auditing\
    \ process of an information system results in\nadditional costs. In a blockchain\
    \ system, a node within the blockchain can publicly audit and share\ntransaction\
    \ records without relying on a trusted third party [62]. According to Zheng, et\
    \ al. [63],\neach transaction is validated and recorded with a timestamp in the\
    \ blockchain; therefore, any user\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 13\ncould trace\
    \ the previous records, providing higher auditability. Interviewee B mentioned\
    \ that\n“in a centralised system, the maintenance audit log exists within the\
    \ centralised system and the\ninternal team that handles the centralised system\
    \ has access to change the logs too. This issue\nis eliminated in a blockchain\
    \ system due to the feature, immutability, as it guarantees almost\n100% auditability”.\
    \ Therefore, a blockchain system has easier ways to fulﬁl auditing purposes\n\
    highlighting the suitability of using blockchain for accounting EC transactions.\n\
    6.\nVeracity—In any information system, veracity can be achieved to a greater\
    \ extent. Unlike manual\ntransactions, where there is a higher possibility for\
    \ human errors, in an automated information\nsystem, possibility for errors is\
    \ comparatively less. However, if erroneous data are entered,\nthe result will\
    \ be faulty. The same aspect is applicable for the blockchain system too. However,\
    \ in a\nblockchain system, there is a validation process that requires any record\
    \ to be validated by a\nmajority of the nodes for it to be recorded as a valid\
    \ transaction. If a faulty record is entered into\nthe blockchain, it will be\
    \ rejected by the nodes. Thus, veracity in a blockchain system is higher,\nmaking\
    \ it the best option for carbon accounting.\n7.\nTransparency—A traditional information\
    \ system has no transparency. Interviewee B emphasised\nthat “in a traditional\
    \ information system, the user has to blindly believe and trust the information\n\
    system and the data, which are displayed to them. The stakeholders/users have\
    \ no way of\nvalidating or checking on the accuracy of the data that are being\
    \ displayed or calculated at\nthe back end”. As an example, using an EC tool such\
    \ as GaBi is very risky, as the user is\nunaware of the method of calculation\
    \ that has been followed to estimate the EC. The user has to\nsimply enter the\
    \ materials used and the process carried out while the software calculates and\n\
    provides the EC estimate. The user is unable to validate the accuracy of the estimate\
    \ due to\nnon-transparency. However, in a blockchain system, one can easily backtrack\
    \ and identify the\nimportant information as well as the source of the data as\
    \ a result of transparency. Interviewees\nA and C agreed that greater transparency\
    \ provides a higher level of auditability. For an EC\nestimating platform, this\
    \ quality of transparency is essential to maintain positive relations with\nusers.\
    \ Carbon accounting in a transparent blockchain platform provides reliability\
    \ and trust\nalong with integrity.\n8.\nDisintermediation—Comparedtoatraditionalsystem,\
    \ ablockchainsystemenablesdisintermediation.\nDue to the difficulty of trusting\
    \ an unknown party, a reliable third-party such as banks or financial\ninstitutes\
    \ are involved when carrying out financial transactions. However, in a decentralised\n\
    blockchain platform, the third-party authorities are removed, and the key transfer\
    \ processes are\nverified and authenticated by nodes in the peer-to-peer network\
    \ [62]. The blockchain provides\ndisintermediation by removing the involvement\
    \ of a third party. In EC estimating, existing EC\ndatabases and tools act as\
    \ a third-party source that could completely change the estimate depending\non\
    \ various factors and issues as discussed previously. Currently, the EC estimates\
    \ are prepared\nby the land developer or very rarely the contractor, who will\
    \ become the third parties in carbon\ncalculation as they may not be the EC contributors\
    \ in certain occasions. For example, though it is\na manufacturer that contributes\
    \ to EC emissions, generally the estimate is prepared by the land\ndeveloper or\
    \ contractor. In a blockchain-based EC estimating system, EC transactions will\
    \ be\nrecorded by the EC contributors in CSCs enhancing the accuracy of the EC\
    \ estimates. Furthermore,\nthe results could be reviewed and analysed by the parties\
    \ who have access to the distributed ledger.\nRemoval of a third party enables\
    \ trust and accuracy while reducing any additional costs.\n9.\nTrust—Reliability\
    \ of data stored in a traditional information system can be questionable due to\n\
    the possibility of entering erroneous data. Therefore, one can be reluctant to\
    \ trust a traditional\ninformation system. However, in a blockchain system, any\
    \ transaction entered to the blockchain\nneeds to be validated by a majority of\
    \ the nodes for the transaction to be recorded in the blockchain.\nThis provides\
    \ great trust among users of a blockchain system. In order to record EC transactions\n\
    accurately, a trustworthy platform is required and thus blockchain is the ideal\
    \ solution. Trust is\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n9 of 13\nthe most important feature\
    \ for the stakeholders in the eco-system to trust the system and use\nblockchain\
    \ to estimate EC accurately.\n10.\nScalability—A traditional information system\
    \ accommodates scalability as it has the possibility\nin adapting to various changing\
    \ needs or demands of the users [64]. Interviewee C added that\n“scalability can\
    \ be categorised based on storage capacity, transaction time, and new functions”.\n\
    Buterin [65] declared that a public blockchain will be able to handle on average\
    \ 3–20 transactions\nper second, whereas, mainstream payment services such as\
    \ VISA, are currently handling\n24,000 transactions per second [66]. However,\
    \ the Bitcoin blockchain processes a maximum of\nseven transactions per second\
    \ and due to the scalability issue in the blockchain design, it is unable\nto\
    \ handle large amounts of transactions [53]. Therefore, the blockchain platform\
    \ initially had this\nscalability issue to a greater extent. Sharding has been\
    \ introduced as a solution to this scalability\nproblem. Through sharding, the\
    \ overheads of processing transactions are split among multiple,\nsmaller groups\
    \ of nodes [67]. According to Luu, et al. [68], Elastico is a proposed permission-less\n\
    blockchain where the agreement throughput is scaled up near linear with the computation\n\
    power of the network and tolerates byzantine adversaries to control up to one-fourth\
    \ of the\ncomputation capacity in a partial synchronous network. Though scalability\
    \ is one of the greatest\ndisadvantages of the blockchain system, if sharding\
    \ is introduced, it can be resolved. All experts\nagreed on introducing sharding\
    \ to resolve the scalability issue in blockchain. On the other hand,\nspeed or\
    \ data transaction rate is not an issue for accounting EC transactions as it has\
    \ a very low\nrate compared to other ﬁnancial services. Besides, the logical equations\
    \ that are used for EC\nestimating are consistent and on the other hand, they\
    \ are non-dependent on the features of a\nproject. Therefore, the speed of transactions\
    \ would not be much of an issue. The storage capacity\nto store all the EC transactions\
    \ is the only challenge that will be faced by the researcher. As a\nsolution for\
    \ this issue most relevant data can be stored on-chain and all other data could\
    \ be stored\noﬀ-chain to improve the eﬃciency of the system.\nThere are various\
    \ use cases that have already implemented blockchain in their systems due to\n\
    the additional beneﬁts provided through its salient features. SelfKey and ShoBadge\
    \ are two secure\nenterprise blockchain systems developed related to identiﬁcation\
    \ authentication using a digital\nwallet [69,70]. Arcade City is a blockchain-based\
    \ ride sharing platform that connects the drivers\nand passengers without the\
    \ involvement of a third party [71]. Power Ledger in Thailand provides\na peer-to-peer\
    \ renewable energy trading platform that ultimately evaluates the trading position\
    \ of\nindividual participants [72]. Filecoin is a digital storage and retrieval\
    \ system that rents their disk space\nfor data storage [73]. In Ghana, BitFury\
    \ and the Georgian government have collaborated to develop a\nland registry using\
    \ blockchain to resolve the current land disputes [7]. BIMCHAIN integrates Building\n\
    Information Modelling (BIM) and Blockchain to deliver trusted digital proofs with\
    \ a clear certiﬁcation\nprocess [74]. These are few of the use cases that have\
    \ used blockchain to develop various systems due to\nits salient features. Similarly,\
    \ blockchain technology could be used to develop an EC estimating system.\n4.\
    \ Conclusions\nBlockchain is an emerging technology that has drawn considerable\
    \ interest from various\nstart-ups, technology developers, enterprises, national\
    \ governments, and the academic community.\nInitially, blockchain was used for\
    \ recording cryptocurrency transactions. However, the trend has shifted\nto using\
    \ blockchain technology for various applications related to diﬀerent industries\
    \ such as science,\nproperty, and construction, among others. The study investigated\
    \ the potential application of using a\nblockchain system to estimate EC in CSCs\
    \ instead of a traditional information system. The extensive\nliterature review\
    \ and expert interviews revealed that compared to a traditional information system,\n\
    a blockchain system is more suitable for an application on accurate estimation\
    \ of EC in CSCs. The results\nhighlighted that most of the salient features of\
    \ blockchain technology (decentralisation, anonymity and\npseudonymity, security,\
    \ immutability, auditability, veracity, transparency, disintermediation, and trust\n\
    (without a third-party)) were quite high in a blockchain system compared to a\
    \ traditional information\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 13\nsystem, whereas,\
    \ scalability was comparatively less in a blockchain system. However, the transaction\n\
    rate in an EC estimating system in the practical context, is quite less and as\
    \ a result, this being\nthe only disadvantage, could be disregarded. In conclusion,\
    \ blockchain technology is positively\nsuitable to develop the EC estimating application,\
    \ compared to a traditional information system.\nA blockchain-based EC estimating\
    \ system could eliminate the existing issues in carbon estimating\nand contribute\
    \ to knowledge as well as the construction industry. The stakeholders involved\
    \ in the\nCSCs could beneﬁt from the EC estimating system that will be developed\
    \ using blockchain technology.\nHowever, the results of this study cannot be generalised\
    \ as the data were collected through a limited\nnumber of interviews due to various\
    \ limitations of the study, especially related to time constraints,\nmaturity\
    \ of the technology, and the knowledge level and experience of the experts. A\
    \ similar process\ncould be followed by other studies to compare blockchain systems\
    \ with traditional information systems,\nto decide on the suitability of using\
    \ blockchain technology for prototype systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original\

    Blockchain technology is a secure distributed ledger for lists of transactions,
    which has immense potential to solve traditional agri-food supply chain issues.
    An increasing number of research on blockchain-based traceability applications
    aims to improve food quality and safety. Still, relatively few works considered
    user interfaces when developing and reporting their applications, which could
    lead to usability issues. This paper aims to address this gap by reviewing existing
    works from user interface perspectives. We gathered 25 review papers on blockchain
    or agri-food supply chain and 39 research papers that presented screenshots of
    user interfaces of related applications. We first reviewed 7 review papers that
    focused on the blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to understand the benefits
    and challenges in the blockchain applications. We then analyzed 14 blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications and 10 non-blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications. The analysis resulted in categorizations of 5 target user groups,
    3 main approaches for collecting data, 5 main approaches for visualizing data,
    and a discussion of other aspects of user interfaces. However, we found insufficient
    details and discussions on the user interfaces and design decisions of the applications
    for further usability assessment. Additionally, user involvement for evaluation
    is lower in blockchain-based researches than in non-blockchain-based researches.
    This trend could lead to usability problems of blockchain applications, causing
    blockchain technology to be underutilized. Finally, we discussed research gaps
    and future research directions related to user interface design, which should
    be addressed to ease future blockchain adoption. In this paper, we first reviewed
    7 review papers about the blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to understand
    the benefits and challenges in the blockchain application...View more Published

    Nowadays, people are increasingly interested in cryptocurrency, a new secure payment
    method that enables anyone to exchange online without the need of trusted parties
    such as banks or credit card companies. The technology underlying the cryptocurrency
    is called the “blockchain.” Blockchain technology introduces distributed storage
    for growing lists of transactions, which are grouped into a block before recording
    on the blockchain. Participants in the blockchain network must mutually agree
    for a block to be recorded. Once recorded, the data cannot be modified without
    changing all subsequent blocks. In short, the blockchain is “an open, distributed
    ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable
    and permanent way [1].” As blockchain technology is gaining more attention, researchers
    began investigating blockchain applications in other domains, including making
    the agri-food supply chain transparent and traceable. The agri-food supply chain
    involves processes to “bring agricultural or horticultural products from the farm
    to the table [2].” Nowadays, customers are looking for food quality, safety, and
    nutrition. However, the traditional supply chain, where a central party holds
    all information, could not provide trustworthy information to interested customers
    in a timely manner. Applications of blockchain technology, where all involved
    parties can access and verify digitalized information, are seen as a way to solve
    traditional agri-food supply chain issues. A considerable number of research papers
    (e.g., [3]–[9]) discussed the potential of blockchains in the agri-food domain.
    However, most papers focused on technical perspectives and rarely paid attention
    to human factors, which are a crucial part of technology adoption. There is a
    very limited understanding of how human users could use this blockchain technology
    to achieve their goals effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily. User interface
    designers, as a part of the Human-Computer Interaction community, could play a
    role in connecting the design and implementation of blockchain technology to reality
    [10], [11]. Domain-wise, research works about the user interface of agri-food
    traceability applications are relatively scarce. A search in Scopus database on
    20 May 2021 with the query (food OR agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability)
    returned 14,272 document results, while the query (“user interface” AND (food
    OR agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability) returned only 28 document
    results. As a result, there is very limited knowledge about how to design user
    interfaces for agri-food traceability applications. Furthermore, the usability
    of those interfaces may be not confirmed due to the lack of user study. This work
    aims to provide a basis for designing usable blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications. We first examined review papers in this domain to understand the
    current state of the development. We were interested in how blockchain could bring
    benefits and challenges to stakeholders, businesses, and technology for agri-food
    supply chains. We then analyzed existing works from a user interface perspective
    to summarize (1) target users and user interface purposes, (2) how applications
    collect the data, (3) how applications visualize the data, and (4) other aspects
    of user interfaces corresponding to the benefits and challenges of the blockchain.
    We then discuss research gaps and how could our classification provide future
    directions of research in this domain. Figure 1 illustrates the paper sources
    and the results. FIGURE 1. Overview of paper sources and results. We first reviewed
    7 review papers about the blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to understand
    the benefits and challenges in the blockchain applications. We then analyzed 24
    user interfaces of agri-food traceability applications to categorize target user
    groups, approaches for collecting data, approaches for visualizing data, and other
    aspects of the user interfaces. Show All Our contributions include: Analysis of
    benefits and challenges in applying blockchain technology for agri-food traceability
    (Section IV) Categorization of user interfaces for agri-food traceability (Section
    V) Discussion of research gaps and future directions regarding user interfaces
    for agri-food traceability (Section VI) The remainder of this paper is organized
    as follows. Section II provides the background on blockchain, agri-food traceability,
    and user interfaces, on which this paper is based on. After that, Section III
    describes the methodology used to conduct the review and analysis in this paper.
    The results are presented in Section IV and Section V. Then, Section VI discusses
    the research gaps and future directions regarding user interfaces for agri-food
    traceability. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper. SECTION II. Background
    Our paper aims to understand the intersection of 3 areas: blockchain, agri-food
    traceability, and user interfaces, which are introduced in this section. A. Blockchain
    Blockchain is a technique to store cryptographically linked records across parties
    in a peer-to-peer network to prevent tampering of records. The blockchain was
    invented to facilitate bitcoin transactions [12]. A “block” consists of a set
    of confirmed transactions or records, a timestamp, and a hash code. The hash code
    is calculated from the content in the block and the previous block (i.e., “chain”).
    Adding the block to the chain requires the majority of the involved parties to
    verify the block. For instance, the prover (or miner) proves to the verifiers
    that the computational effort has been expended for some purpose (Proof-of-Work).
    Other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Authority (PoA) or Proof of Assignment
    (PoAss), can also be used (see [13] for a review). Blockchain components include
    [9], [14], [15]: Cryptography: Strong encryption to allow decryption by authorized
    users only; Ledger: A shared and distributed database to store data; Consensus:
    A protocol to prevent minor nodes to modify transactions; Smart Contract: Rules,
    penalties, and actions to be automatically applied to the involved parties once
    the condition is met. Main features and characteristics of blockchain include
    [3], [13], [14], [16]: Decentralization: Nodes (participants) in a peer to peer
    network work together to process and validate data without a need for a single
    central trust party; Trust-less: Each participant can participate without knowing
    each other; Anonymity: Each participant can communicate using a generated virtual
    identity code; Permission-less: There is no restriction of participants; Autonomy:
    Each node can safely perform transactions without third party intervention; Ownership
    and uniqueness: A block include transaction information as well as its owner and
    a unique hash code; Irreversibly and Persistency: Canceling a transaction is impossible
    once a chain adds the block; Immutability: Timestamps and controls ensure that
    stored data cannot be changed; Transparency: Involved parties can access and trace
    stored data; Auditability: Securely linked blocks facilitate transaction verification
    and tracking; Provenance: A digital information attached to each product can prove
    its authenticity and origin; Censorship resistant: Transactions cannot be censored
    as a network does not need controllers; Open source: Everyone in the network can
    access the source with a sense of hierarchy. Not all features are desirable. For
    instance, the permissionless property could introduce security issues since anyone
    can create a transaction that could be used for malicious purposes. Implementation
    of a blockchain system could differ in terms of who are the provers and validators
    of blocks, who can access the system, security and efficiency level, design methods,
    and blockchain authority [13]. These choices could classify blockchains into three
    types: public, private, and consortium blockchain (i.e., permissioned or hybrid
    blockchain). This paper does not focus on the technical aspects of blockchain.
    Rather, we focus on how these features could benefit or raise issues in agri-food
    traceability applications as well as how they influence user interface design.
    B. Agri-Food Supply Chain and Traceability Agri-food supply chain is “the activities
    from production to distribution that brings agricultural or horticultural products
    from the farm to the table [2].” The agri-food supply chain is more complex and
    difficult to handle than other supply chains due to the presence of various stakeholders
    and influences. Agri-food products have limited shelf life. Food safety and quality
    depend on time as well as environments, such as weather and transportation. Contamination
    can occur at any stage. Furthermore, food globalization results in longer food
    chains, which complicates foodborne disease investigation and product recall [17].
    This complexity leads to the need for higher efficiency and closer partner collaboration.
    Traditional food supply chains generally rely on a central party to manage information,
    which could lead to transparency and trust issues. For instance, a company may
    release only information beneficial to them. Customers could have difficulty verifying
    many food characteristics claimed by the company. When there are food safety scandals,
    the information asymmetry situation between the public and food manufacturers
    could affect customers’ judgments and result in decreasing sale volume [18]. Traceability
    systems offer a means to address issues in food supply chains. International Organization
    for Standardization (ISO) defined traceability as “the ability to follow the movement
    of a feed or food through specified stage(s) of production, processing, and distribution”
    in ISO 22005:2007 [19], though the actual definition of traceability varies by
    the variety of food [20]. Regardless of minor differences in the definitions,
    knowing movement and steps in the production process could facilitate recalling
    contaminated products, thus improving consumers’ safety and confidence. The traceability
    can be categorized based on several stakeholders involved and traceability requirements.
    The traceability could involve a single stakeholder (i.e., intra-company or internal
    level) or all stakeholders (i.e., supply chain or external level) [21], [22].
    European Community market categorizes traceability into mandatory traceability
    and voluntary traceability [21], [23]. Mandatory traceability mainly aims for
    financial purposes whereas voluntary traceability mainly aims for food safety
    and quality. Trustworthy and complete traceability require both mandatory and
    voluntary traceability processes. However, as each stakeholder has various standards
    and tracking methods, the voluntary system is complex with a wide variety of acquired
    data [24]. In general, Corallo et al. [21] suggested four major questions when
    developing a traceability system: which data to collect, who own the data, how
    to collect the data, and how to make the data available and understandable. This
    paper focuses on the supply chain (external level). We are particularly interested
    in how to collect the data, and how to make the data available and understandable,
    which influence and could be benefited by better user interface design. C. Blockchain-Based
    AGRI-Food Traceability Many researchers are adopting blockchain technology as
    a way to facilitate traceability. The blockchain is deemed to “bring transparency,
    enhance information authenticity, and speed up food recall [9].” The blockchain
    potential is demonstrated by a considerable number of review papers that focused
    on the blockchain-based supply chain in agriculture or food domain [3]–[9], with
    the highest number of 178 reviewed items by Dutta et al. [3]. This paper also
    focuses on blockchain-based supply chain traceability in the agriculture or food
    domain. We provide an analysis of the review papers in this domain. Additionally,
    we present a discussion on the user interface (i.e., how to collect the data and
    how to make the data available and understandable), which was not discussed in
    other review papers. D. Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design “Human-computer
    interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design
    of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the
    users) and computers [25].” HCI overlaps with multiple research areas, including
    user interface (UI) design that concerns the mean for users to interact with a
    system. User interface design generally aims at improving usability, which can
    be assessed by five quality components (learnability, efficiency, memorability,
    errors, satisfaction) [26]. One basic method to evaluate usability is user testing.
    Researchers can identify usability problems by observing representative users
    perform representative tasks with the user interface. Successful software development
    desires usable interfaces. However, studies on HCI and UI for blockchain are still
    inadequate. Foth [11] discussed a beef supply chain case study and blockchain
    research agenda for HCI, calling for interaction designers to be aware of blockchain
    technology. Elsden et al. [10] surveyed 200 emerging blockchain startups, projects,
    and applications to identify the role of HCI in connecting the design and application
    of blockchain technology. They found that research in HCI mostly focused on money,
    finance, and peer-to-peer exchange. They suggested more researches in engaging
    participants and designing with blockchain in other domains. This paper focuses
    on the agri-food domain. We investigated works that engaged participants in their
    development process and looked for classifications that could aid blockchain designing.
    SECTION III. Methodology We conducted a systematic literature search in the Scopus
    database, which is one of the largest databases of peer-reviewed literature. The
    search was done during November and December 2020 using the following queries
    for title, abstract, and keywords (TITLE-ABS-KEY). Q1: blockchain AND (food OR
    agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability) Q2: “user interface” AND (food
    OR agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability) Q3: blockchain and “user
    interface” Q4: blockchain and HCI We interested in (1) blockchain, (2) agriculture,
    food, supply chain, and/or traceability, and (3) user interface. Figure 2 illustrates
    three topics of interest and how the query aims to address the overlapping topics.
    The white areas, such as blockchain without user interface in other domains, are
    not in the scope of this paper. FIGURE 2. A diagram showing the topics of (1)
    blockchain, (2) agriculture, food, supply chain, and/or traceability, and (3)
    user interface. Grey areas indicate where each Query covered. The number behind
    the query number is the number of papers returned by the query. Show All We formulated
    these queries to cover all aspects that could be useful in designing a user interface
    for blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. The first query aimed
    to gather all works on blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. We
    excluded the term “user interface” from this query. Instead, we manually skimmed
    papers for a user interface to avoid missing works that did not focus on the user
    interface but implemented one. The rest of the queries aimed to gather the user
    interface of similar works, i.e., either agri-food traceability application or
    blockchain application in general, that may be applicable to blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications. They also helped to gather related works
    that used other specific terms, such as coffee instead of agriculture. There was
    no publication year restriction. We found 335 articles in total. After removing
    7 duplicated articles, we filtered the results using the following inclusion criteria:
    The full-text of the article was in English; The article was a full research or
    review paper (e.g., workshop papers and proceedings are excluded); The full-text
    of the article was available and accessible; The article discussed either blockchain,
    agriculture, food, supply chain, or traceability in detail. We then group the
    articles into two major categories: The article that provided an overview of the
    topic (i.e., review papers) The article that contained a screenshot of the user
    interface of the application We then further group articles based on topics: blockchain,
    agriculture, food, supply chain, traceability, and/or user interface. Figure 3
    provides the overview of our review methodology and topic grouping. Note that
    works outside a group might briefly mention the group. For example, two review
    papers of blockchain in general might mention the supply chain in their discussion,
    but not in detail. FIGURE 3. Review methodology where n is a number of articles.
    The shaded boxes indicated papers we focused in this review while the dashes boxes
    indicated papers that we skimmed through. Show All As demonstrated in Figure 3,
    the majority of works in blockchain-based agri-food traceability do not present
    a screenshot of the user interface, which could be one reason for lacking a review
    paper in this domain. Finally, we focused on 7 papers that reviewed blockchain-based
    agri-food supply chain, 14 papers included screenshots of blockchain-based agri-food
    supply chain applications, and 10 papers included screenshots of non-blockchain-based
    (traditional) agri-food supply chain applications. We first analyzed the review
    papers to understand the current development, benefits, and challenges in applying
    blockchain to agri-food supply chain traceability in Section IV. The analysis
    provided a basis for analyzing user interfaces in Section V and discussion in
    Section VI. Note that we gave higher priority to screenshots since it allowed
    better analysis of user interface elements than text description. Other articles
    that fitted the criteria but did not fall into any group were skimmed and included
    in this review only when we found them useful in the discussion. We also performed
    ad-hoc searches for key papers that were cited in gathered papers or deemed as
    useful for our discussion. The ad-hoc articles were not included in the figures.
    Our method has two limitations. First, there could be works that addressed specific
    agri-food products but did not show up in our search results. The queries could
    retrieve some specific agri-food products. For instance, the query “blockchain
    and ’user interface”’ did retrieve a blockchain-based autonomous coffee machine
    [27]. However, the queries excluded the works about blockchain-based coffee supply
    chains without the “user interface” keyword. Due to the vast variety of agri-food
    products, formulating queries for all products is very difficult. Second, we inspected
    the user interface manually from the provided screenshots. Thus, we might not
    be able to fully examine all user interface features. SECTION IV. Benefits and
    Challenges: a Review of Reviews This section summarizes the benefits and challenges
    of applying blockchain to the agri-food supply chains for traceability discussed
    in the review papers. We found 25 review papers of related topics, as listed in
    Table 1. The table notes whether the paper apparently discussed (1) models or
    frameworks to design or implement applications, (2) benefits or opportunities,
    and (3) challenges regarding the topic they reviewed. We found that most review
    papers discussed at least one of these three aspects in at least one section of
    the papers. Only [28] focused on technology applications. TABLE 1 The List of
    25 Review Papers With Title, Year of Publication, Where Number of Reviewed Papers
    as Well as an Indication Whether the Paper Apparently Discussed Model/Framework,
    Benefits/Opportunities, or Challenges Our analysis focused on seven review papers
    [3]–[9] that directly discussed blockchain-based supply chain in the agriculture
    or food domain (a part of Q1 area in Figure 2). Other review papers that missed
    some of the components, e.g., discussed only agriculture but not food, were noted.
    However, we decided to exclude the notes in this analysis since those findings
    may not directly apply to our focus domain and the seven review papers should
    be sufficient for this analysis. The seven papers discuss the benefits and challenges
    of blockchain in many aspects in their texts. We extracted the benefits and challenges
    and organized them into three categories: stakeholders, business, and technology.
    Table 2 provides the overview of the topics that each paper discussed and their
    references to support the discussion. Note that we removed some dead links and
    references that we deemed to be too general to support the arguments. TABLE 2
    The Overview of the Topics That Each Review Paper Discussed and Their References
    to Support the Discussion. Note That a Review Paper May Discuss the Topic Without
    Providing a Specific Reference A. Stakeholder This section discusses the benefits
    and challenges that apply to an actor in a supply chain. Each review paper identified
    different supply chain phases and stakeholders. For instance, traceability business
    stages by Feng et al. [4] included farming, harvesting, processing, logistics,
    cold storage, and consuming. On the other hand, steps in the food supply chain
    by Galvez et al. [8] included production, processing, storage, distribution, retailers,
    and administration. Regardless of the differences, we could classify the target
    stakeholders of benefits and challenges into producers, intermediaries, consumers,
    and regulators. 1) Producers Producers refer to people who produce an agricultural
    product or food ingredients, such as farmers or fishermen. Blockchain could safeguard
    farmers [3] and provide financial benefits to small or medium-size farmers in
    developing countries [6]. Blockchain-based applications, such as AgriLedger [44],
    FarmShare [43], and Davcev’s application [45], were deemed to foster cooperation
    among farmers and other stakeholders of the chain. Such cooperation could improve
    financial inclusion in developing economies [46]. Transparency of information
    could provide a fairer solution to conflicts among farmers. Blockchain applications
    could also provide a platform for traceability (e.g., [158]) or insurance programs
    (e.g., [159]) to the farmers. Regardless of the benefits, Kamilaris et al. [6]
    also mentioned challenges about farmers’ adoption, as the farmers need to understand
    blockchain before start using it [48]. This issue relates to the cost and risk
    of blockchain in Section IV-B4. 2) Intermediaries Intermediaries refer to people
    who buy the product from one stakeholder and sell to another, including wholesalers
    and retailers. Kamilaris et al. [6] referred to Sander’s survey [49] about positive
    influences of blockchain on purchasing decisions. Though the blockchain could
    help improve sales, limited resources of small and medium enterprises might be
    a challenge in their blockchain adoption [50]. 3) Consumers Customers refer to
    people who consume the product. Blockchain could improve consumer’s awareness
    and empowerment [6], as well as improve food safety and quality [3], [8], [51],
    [55]. Customers could ensure food safety and quality as blockchain-based applications
    provide real-time monitoring of biological, chemical, and physical hazards [52].
    Blockchain could facilitate reliable food exchange through higher traceability
    to achieve food integrity [8], [53]. As blockchain applications could quickly
    identify and link outbreaks back to specific sources [54], it could mitigate food
    fraud. Galvez et al. [8], however, raised challenges about rapidly changing consumer
    preferences and confidence due to product recalls and social networks. Also, as
    products with traceability typically come with higher prices, they could become
    a target of food fraudsters [6], [53]. 4) Regulators Regulators and authorities
    refer to people who verify and enforce regulations of the supply chain to, for
    example, ensure food safety. Blockchain applications could facilitate supply chain
    auditing [3] and reduce food risks [9], [56]. For example, the Accenture Traceability
    report [55] discussed a pilot study of blockchain with smart tagging to prevent
    illegal tuna fishing. Trust audit checking was supported by tamper-proof and traceable
    properties of blockchain [4]. Interestingly, all seven reviews discussed challenges
    in regulation, including regulation uncertainty, the role of governments, and
    conflicting between national regulators. One reason could be that regulation is
    one of the most underexplored areas [52]. As a central authority is inessential
    in a blockchain system, it prevents interventions like censorship as well as creates
    many uncertainties [57]. There are no legal regulations and standards to follow
    [61]. For instance, Lucena et al. [59] proposed blockchain-based grain quality
    assurance tracking but acknowledged that they did not prove their application
    in complex scenarios involving international trade and arbitration laws. This
    lack of policy and regulation leads to an adoption barrier [6]. Regulators should
    develop new policies or regulations to monitor and regulate the blockchain [58]
    to protect users [55], [60] and reduce the barrier for its wider adoption [7],
    [60]. 5) Relationship Between Stakeholders Blockchain provides a secure distributed
    means for transactions, connecting stakeholders from different locations, rules,
    or applications together [6], [53], [60], [63], [64]. Blockchain technology has
    the potential to provide a solid end-to-end connection between farmers and large
    buyers [70]–[72]. Participating parties could increase their reliability, responsibility,
    and commitment [66], [67]. Functioning as a digital institution of trust [65],
    the blockchain could enhance trust of customers [69] and collaboration between
    supply chain partners [4], [68]. This benefit could reduce dependency or remove
    intermediaries [3], [6]. Blockchains could both bring benefits and raise challenges
    related to each stakeholder. In practice, however, analyzing the benefits and
    challenges could be complicated due to the diversity and conflicts between stakeholders
    in the chain [3], [5], [8]. Different stakeholders in different sectors or industries
    or countries could have different objectives and practices. While blockchain could
    remove intermediaries, the perception that blockchain could lead to job loss is
    one challenge in blockchain adoption [3]. Also, as blockchain connects stakeholders
    together, there is an important question about who should own the blockchain [6],
    [60]. B. Business This section discusses benefits and challenges that apply to
    actors across a supply chain, which affect the business of buying and selling
    agri-food products. We classify them into traceability, efficiency, privacy, cost
    and risk, and sustainability. 1) Traceability Blockchain allows users to follow
    agri-food products between stakeholders in a supply chain. Feng et al. [4] analyzed
    the traceability issues that blockchains could address, including how to coordinate,
    verify, link, and record transactions. The blockchain allows origin tracing of
    products from farms to consumers [3], [4], [77]–[80]. Chan et al. [82] proposed
    a blockchain-based agri-food supply chain management framework for traceability
    and transparency, which allows information disclosing to stakeholders in a supply
    chain, so it addresses information asymmetry [9], [52]. In addition to transparency,
    blockchain allows stakeholders to audit transactions [9], [73]. As the blockchain
    is immutable, it ensures that information will not be tampered [75], [76]. All
    valid users can examine and have a copy of the transaction history [74]. Galvez
    et al. [8] also discussed the potential of blockchain in food authenticity, which
    ensured no alteration of information that could happen when it was under the control
    of a specific party. Thus, blockchains may be used to tackle food fraud and increase
    traceability performance. Traceability, however, relies on data collection. A
    lack of records is simply a challenge of food traceability [8]. Products can be
    purposely damaged without notifying blockchain users [77]. Furthermore, it is
    difficult to ensure the authenticity, security, and integrity of raw input data
    [4], [8], [9], [57]. The data accuracy, either from sensors or persons, cannot
    be guaranteed [5], [8]. Furthermore, analytical methods cannot monitor all parameters
    of food products, especially the environmental parameters [5], [6], [53], [83].
    To address this data manipulation issue, third parties such as governments could
    make regular checks in the blockchain network [9], [52], [55]. 2) Efficiency Blockchain
    could enhance business performance with less effort. Dutta et al. [3], Leng et
    al. [93], and Hasan et al. [94] argued that blockchain could enhance the overall
    efficiency, throughput, and credibility of the related platforms, which could
    ease business expansion. Blockchain with digitized product movement and certifications
    provides real-time information of food products [9], [52], [68] and could reduce
    time to trace from nearly a week to few seconds [6], [9], [85], [88]. This property
    allows a quick trace of contaminated products when there is an outbreak of an
    animal or plant disease [6], [65]. Trust and self-organized nature could reduce
    human intervention [9], [89]. Integration with IoT devices makes the supply chain
    more efficient [4], [8], [9], [52], [55], [68], [89]–[92]. Ferrer [87], for example,
    leveraged blockchain to enhance the security, autonomy, and flexibility of agricultural
    robotic swarm operations. Thiruchelvam et al. [95] leveraged blockchain to facilitate
    data recording and automatic payment transfer. Blockchain with smart contracts
    can automatically execute and evaluate transactions [8], [84], which can prevent
    further damage with warnings [9], [52], [73]. Participants can evaluate the assertions
    made and notify interested parties according to conditions such as quality, timing,
    or quantity. Smart contracts could lead to scalable and flexible businesses at
    a lower cost, thus improve the overall effectiveness of manufacturing services
    [6], [86]. There is no specific challenge regarding business efficiency. 3) Privacy
    Anonymity and security property of blockchain could support keeping personal and
    business matters and relationships secret. Dutta et al. [3] suggested that blockchain
    could increase the privacy of enterprise information. Transaction visibility and
    anonymity of blockchain could ensure the traceability, reliability, security,
    and information timeliness of agri-food products [4]. Compared to the benefits
    that were briefly mentioned, blockchain raises more privacy problems. Permanent
    data visibility and transparency could compromise privacy [6], [7], [57]. Zhao
    et al. [7] discussed several works that raised the privacy leakage issue and efforts
    for protecting privacy. For example, some stakeholders might not want to share
    information to maintain business competitiveness. Private or permissioned blockchain
    might be preferred over public blockchains. The selection of the proper type was
    not sufficiently discussed and seen as one challenge in blockchain implementation
    [5]. Even with privacy management, transactional privacy can still not be guaranteed
    because all participants in the network can access all information [7], [96],
    [97], and some participants might be competitors [98]. There is still no method
    to hide all involved parties and transaction amount at the same time [7], [100].
    Privacy is one of the two major drawbacks of blockchain [7], [101]. There is a
    need to consider these issues on data management, particularly data ownership
    and data retention [5], [60]. 4) Cost and Risk Kamilaris et al. [6] suggested
    that blockchain could help reduce transaction fees and facilitate fairer pricing
    through the whole chain. The cost of computing and censoring the equipment required
    to run the system was deemed as a challenge in adopting blockchain (e.g., [3],
    [5]–[7]). Adopting blockchain could require many product transformations and organizational
    changes [5], which needs a lot of money and time [3], [7], [103], [108]. The cost
    of implementing blockchain could be a barrier for adopting [6], [9], [55], [60],
    [102]. Developing countries may find difficulties because of the high degree of
    computing equipment required [6], [7]. Hence, Duan et al. [9], [55], [60] suggested
    that the blockchain should be more “SME friendly.” As the technology was still
    in the early stage, high uncertainties and market volatility could also be challenges
    in the adoption. Many stakeholders have old mindsets as well as a lack of awareness
    of blockchain technology and its advantages (e.g., [6], [7], [9], [114]). There
    exists an idea that blockchain may deskill workers and organizations [6], [111].
    Furthermore, convincing business cases are still limited. [6], [48]. The high
    volatility of cryptocurrencies could reduce the public trust of the blockchain
    technology [6], [112]. Many stakeholders may have limited education and required
    skills to adopt a blockchain-based application [3], [5]–[7]. The training platforms
    are still inadequate [6], [110]. Regardless of these costs and risks, the benefits
    of blockchain make the costs sustainable [6], [9], [102]. Requirements of adoption
    could be varied by stages of the supply chain [9], [55]. Perboli et al. [102]
    encouraged the partial implementation of blockchain instead of replacing the whole
    system. Other technologies can be more suitable in some cases [9], [55], [114].
    Improving users’ familiarity with blockchain could improve adoption attitude [9],
    [113]. Finally, governments should play a role in reducing adoption barriers by
    setting examples [5], [6]. 5) Sustainability Blockchain could improve the ability
    to maintain the business in economic, environmental, and social aspects [6]. Blockchain
    could aid supervision and management [3], [130], which helps eliminate food adulteration,
    improve food safety and quality, and reduce uncoordinated issues, thus increasing
    sustainability (e.g., [3], [8], [60], [126]–[129]). Blockchain could help in resource
    allocation [3] as well as enhance demand and quality prediction [4], [9], [76],
    [120]–[122]. Better management could reduce economic loss and product waste [4],
    [61], [108], [123] as well as provide support for emission reduction [6]. Blockchain
    for recording water quality data could lead to sustainable water management [6],
    [7], [9], [119]. Socially, blockchain could empower the poor in developing countries
    [118] and provide food security (e.g., by providing a food coupon to refugees
    [117]). Consumers became more interested in environmental impact and ethical working
    conditions [8], [131], [132]. Lee et al. [64] suggested blockchain as a tool for
    monitoring social and environmental responsibility. Similarly, Rejeb [90] suggested
    blockchain as a framework for environmental, social, and economic regulatory,
    as well as corruption mitigation. Wrongdoings outside the organization could be
    held accountable [8], [133]. C. Technology This section discusses technology advantages
    and challenges brought by blockchain, including scalability, security, and infrastructure.
    1) Scalability Dutta et al. [3] discussed blockchain for supply chain functions
    that addressed many traditional supply chain issues and improved scalability,
    which could enable a business or a system to grow larger. Scalability, however,
    was deemed an important challenge in blockchain applications. Main issues include
    transaction speed, latency, and storage capacity of blockchain and IoT devices
    [4]–[8]. Latency refers to the delay between a user’s actions and the system’s
    responses. Four papers ([4], [6]–[8]) discussed latency issues with reference
    to various works such as [57], [142], [143]. Network delays can necessitate additional
    computational resources and processing time [7], [139]. Transaction speed is one
    of the two main challenges of blockchain applications [7], [101]. Information
    transparency and immutability could lead to performance issues in supply chains
    [6], [111]. Ethereum, for example, could handle 15 transactions per second, which
    was very slow compared to 45,000 transactions per second in traditional platforms
    [9], [141]. Large transaction volumes require more time and mechanisms to validate
    large blocks [7], [136], [138]. Storage requirements of blockchain are significant
    [7], [57]. Any individual in a supply chain must have all transaction records
    on hand at all times [7], [103], thus the blockchain could become voluminous [135].
    Pearson et al. [60] suspected that these scalability issues lead to limited usage
    of blockchain. 2) Security Blockchain could enhance data integrity and transaction
    security through digital fingerprint [3], [4], [144]–[146]. Such fingerprint could
    be stored in a local file, local hash tree, external hash tree, distributed ledger,
    public database, or hybrid distributed ledgers [8]. Although blockchain is secure
    by design, ensuring security is challenging and data security is still an issue
    [4], [149]. Programming bugs could also introduce vulnerability in smart contracts
    [4], [147]. 3) Infrastructure Overall infrastructure was also a challenge in blockchain
    adoption. Duan et al. [9], Perboli et al. [102], and Ometoruwa‘ [154] suggested
    difficulties in realizing decentralization, scalability, and security at the same
    time. Different ways to balance the three features might be needed for different
    stages of the food supply chain [9], [55]. Design limitations constrained the
    choice of consensus algorithm, transaction capacity, and data accessibility [4],
    [142], [143], [155]. As traceability requires information exchange between stakeholders,
    which could adopt different systems, interoperability and standardization were
    challenges discussed in [3]–[5]. Blockchain was often combined with IoT to offer
    scalability, security, auditing, efficiency, interoperability, and quality solutions
    [9], [91]. Nonetheless, the capability of IoT-based devices is less than that
    needed by blockchain [4], [57], [155]. Moreover, complex underlying digital technology
    that incorporates sensors or other third-party tools might compromise the decentralized
    trust [6], [68], [150]–[152]. There exists a digital gap between developed, developing,
    and underdeveloped countries [5], [6], [153]. Poor infrastructure, such as an
    absence of public key infrastructure, would not be sufficient to satisfy the needs
    of a blockchain-based system [4]. New users might find a barrier to market due
    to this issue [6], [60], especially if large companies implement private and permissioned
    blockchain [6], [60]. SECTION V. User Interface This section reviews articles
    that included screenshots of user interfaces for 14 blockchain-based and 10 non-blockchain-based
    agri-food applications. We also considered articles that did not include screenshots
    or included screenshots of blockchain-based applications in other domains as well
    since some of them could benefit from designing blockchain-based agri-food applications.
    The following subsections summarize the target users and purpose of the interfaces,
    how such interfaces were designed to support traceability, as well as other aspects
    of user interfaces that facilitate traceability applications. A. Target Users
    and Purposes Table 3 and Table 4 provide the list of blockchain-based and non-blockchain-based
    agri-food applications, respectively. The tables include title, year of publication,
    as well as an indication of whether the paper included a screenshot of user interfaces
    for each stakeholder, discussed model or architecture, or involved users in development
    or testing. Note that the lack of a checkmark means unclear whether the interface
    is for a corresponding user. TABLE 3 List of 14 Articles Focusing on Blockchain-Based
    Applications for Agri-Food Supply Chain. The List Includes the Title, Year of
    Publication, As Well as an Indication of Whether the Paper Discussed Models or

    of a User Interface for Each Stakeholder. Note That the Lack of a Checkmark Means
    Unclear Whether the Interface is for a Corresponding User TABLE 4 A List of 10
    Articles Focusing on Non-Blockchain Applications for Agri-Food Supply Chain. The
    List Includes the Title, Year of Publication, as Well as an Indication of Whether
    the Paper Discussed Models or Architecture, Involved Users in Development or Testing,
    and Included a Screenshot of a User Interface for Each Stakeholder. The Lack of
    a Checkmark Means Unclear Whether the Interface is for a Corresponding User We
    categorize target users of agri-food applications based on stakeholders. Similar
    to the stakeholders discussed in IV-A, the target users include producers, intermediaries,
    and customers. The target users also include processors who transform the product
    into other forms, such as egg packagers or food processing industries, and distributors
    who transfer and/or distribute the product between stakeholders. The purpose of
    a user interface generally varies by the target users. 1) Producers Screenshots
    of user interfaces for producers were mostly presented in early works on agri-food
    applications, which did not leverage blockchain. Only a few blockchain-based research
    works provided screenshots for producers. The purposes were mostly to support
    decision making, which we found in a livestock management system [174], a decision
    support system for identification of genetically modified food or feed products
    [176], a weather forecast information dissemination system [177], a decision support
    system for choosing the priority of corporate social responsibility (CSR) program
    [173], and a credit evaluation system [130]. Only two works provided an interface
    to load information to a system, i.e., registering crops [164] and loading information
    into RFID tags for identifying and verifying agrochemicals [171]. This trend could
    be influenced by the usage of sensors to automatically input information to a
    system. Section V-B will discuss the input methods in more detail. 2) Processors
    Similar to user interfaces for producers, user interfaces for processors aimed
    at updating information [167] and supporting decision making [172]. Cong An et
    al. [167] built a supply chain management system based on blockchain technology
    for tracking the origins of agriculture products. Ali and Bahnasawy [172] purposed
    a decision support system for food processing industries. 3) Distributors Palacio
    et al. [175] interviewed 50 people to understand the requirements in medicinal
    product transportation, then provided screenshots of the user interface for logistics
    personnel and messengers. The paper focused on monitoring temperature in the cold
    chain, which proper temperature control in logistics was essential. 4) Intermediaries
    There are more user interfaces targeted intermediaries. Three of them also provided
    user interfaces for the producers [130], [173], [176], where another one was a
    system for the distribution process of regional products [179]. All interfaces
    aimed at providing information and visualization for decision-making. Although
    some papers (e.g., [162], [180]) mentioned updating functionality, they did not
    provide screenshots nor discuss in detail. 5) Customers User interfaces for agri-food
    applications mostly focused on customers, especially for blockchain-based traceability
    applications. Customer’s user interfaces primarily visualize information for decision
    making. Two works [130], [167] also targeted producers, processors, or intermediaries.
    Other works allow customers to trace food products [126], [163], [166], farmland
    products [165], agriculture products [168], and specific agri-food products (i.e.,
    coffee [27] and Italian extra-virgin olive oil [169]). Section V-C will discuss
    the visualization methods in more detail. In addition to user interfaces for specific
    target stakeholders, some works provided user interfaces for system administrators
    or did not explicitly state target users [160]–[162], [164], [165], [167], [170],
    [178]. Interestingly, neither processors nor distributors were discussed as targets
    of benefits or source of challenges in the review papers. On the other hand, no
    work explicitly provided a screenshot for regulators or authorities though some
    articles included them as a stakeholder. The lack of exploration was in line with
    the finding when we reviewed the review articles. Overall, as counted in the Table
    3 and Table 4, the target users of blockchain-based agri-food applications concentrated
    on the customers, shifting from the non-blockchain-based applications where the
    target users leaned to the producers. This trend could probably influence by the
    benefit of blockchain in providing traceability and transparency to the supply
    chain, so the customers could access and trust the information. Another trend
    is that the researches on blockchain mostly discussed and focused on the model
    or architecture to implement the applications, with little user involvement during
    the application designing or testing. We discuss the user involvement in the following
    subsections when we discuss the user interface. B. How to Collect the Data We
    categorize how a traceability application gathers information into three methods:
    form entry, label scanning, and sensor transmission, as summarized in Table 5.
    TABLE 5 Input Methods With Description and Examples 1) Form Entry Form entry gets
    information through, for example, text fields or buttons. A user manually inputs
    information to a system. The system could leverage the input form at any stage
    of a supply chain, such as crop registration [164], livestock management [174],
    logistics [175], or purchasing [126]. The form could be used as a basis or in
    conjunction with other methods. Peets et al. [171], for example, proposed a user
    interface consisting of retrieved data as well as confirm and manual entry buttons
    to assist information loading to a label. They also conducted an experiment with
    10 commercially active sprayer operators and interviewed participants for an opinion
    about the size of the screen, instructions, and the flow of the program. However,
    they only mentioned that the user interface was well received by the participants,
    without the detail of their findings. 2) Label Scanning Label scanning loads information
    from a piece of material attached to an object. One common way is a QR code (Quick
    Response code), which can be printed on a container for a customer to access product
    traceability information [126], [161], [164]–[166], [168], [169]. The label usually
    appears as a way to access information gathered via other methods. A user needs
    a reader to read the embedded information for the label to a system. A label could
    also leverage other technologies, such as a barcode, Near-Field Communication
    (NFC), or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Violino et al. [181] compared
    NFC, RFID, and blockchain-based gamification QR code. Their questionnaire and
    interview found that the QR appeared more attractive, probably due to transparency,
    incentive, and gamification. Bumblauskas et al. [126] put a QR on egg packages
    sold in four retailers. They found a 21.2% scan rate with 2 minutes 48 seconds
    visiting duration on average, which exceeded their goals in their proof of concept
    phase. This finding led to interest for further development of the system from
    their stakeholders. 3) Sensor Transmission Sensor transmission leverages devices
    to automatically gather information such as temperature, humidity, fertilizer
    concentration of the soil, or location, as seen in [126], [160], [163], [166],
    [168], [175], [180]. A system could use one or multiple sensors to reduce the
    time taken and human error when entering data. The sensor is seen as a way to
    address inaccurate data issues, which is one challenge in the blockchain application
    discussed in Section IV-A. The usage of sensors and IoT in blockchain applications
    was reviewed in [13], [14], [35]. C. How to Visualize the Data We categorize how
    traceability applications present information into five types: formatted text,
    table, timeline, graph, and map, as summarized in Table 6. In some cases, additional
    information could be visualized using other representations. We also found cases
    where a system uses multiple types of visualization. TABLE 6 Visualization Methods
    With Description and Examples 1) Formatted Text Formatted text presents information
    using texts that are arranged or structured into some patterns. Basnayake and
    Rajapakse [161], for instance, simply provided a history of organic food by listing
    the contract and owner identification number. Others grouped information based
    on stakeholders, then listed each property as a text label with detail, as visualized
    in Figure 4. The screenshot of agriculture product origins tracking system by
    Cong An et al. [167] showed information groups including product overview information
    (identifier and involved stakeholders), farmer (e.g., fertilizer and pesticides),
    importer (e.g., amount and storage address), and processor (e.g., expiry day and
    packing address). Similarly, Guo et al. [160] grouped information based on stakeholders.
    However, instead of displaying all information on one page as Tran’s, they showed
    only one stakeholder per page. FIGURE 4. An example of a user interface with formatted
    text visualization from Cong An et al. [167]. The screen shows the label and detail
    of each property, grouped by stakeholders. (Reproduced with permissions from the
    authors). Show All 2) Table Table presents information in rows and columns. The
    table could either be with borders such as in a livestock management system [174]
    (see Figure 5) or without borders such as in an autonomous coffee machine [27].
    Both examples have transactions or products as rows and properties in columns.
    FIGURE 5. An example of a user interface with table visualization from Ismail
    and Ismail [174]. The screen shows each property in a column and each transaction
    in a row. (Reproduced with permissions from the authors). Show All 3) Timeline
    Timeline presents information as a time-ordered list where items are connected
    by a line, as visualized in Figure 6. Mobile traceability applications, such as
    egg tracking application [126] and olive oil traceability application [169], vertically
    list events with a brief summarization. Alternatively, events could be arranged
    horizontally, as seen in the food traceability web application [166], which allows
    access from any device. FIGURE 6. An example of a user interface with timeline
    visualization from Bumblauskas et al. [126]. The screen displays transactions
    in order and connects them with a line. (Reproduced with permissions from the
    authors). Show All 4) Graph Graph presents information as a diagram showing the
    relation between items. We found one paper, a kiosk application for fishery product
    traceability [180], that represented supply chain events in an oriented graph.
    The author also compared the graph with the map representation, as discussed in
    the next paragraph. 5) Map Map presents information on a drawing showing geographical
    location features such as cities or roads, as visualized in Figure 7. Details
    on a map can be varied. For instance, Tradigo et al. [165] only pinned a production
    location on a map. Oliveira et al. [180] pinned and linked locations of each stage
    in a supply chain, whereas Palacio et al. [175] plotted the route that the logistics
    personnel took. Palacio’s proposed system was validated in real conditions in
    a local laboratory. However, the case study presented no details about the usability
    of the system. On the other hand, Oliveira et al. tested the usability of their
    system as well as compared the graph and map representations with 35 customers.
    They found that the participants preferred the map over the graph since the graph
    could be confusing for some users. The participants also asked for details on
    the map itself rather than the graph. FIGURE 7. An example of a user interface
    with map visualization from Tradigo et al. [165]. The screen displays the location
    of the producer on a map showing land features. (Reproduced with permissions from
    the authors). Show All We also found systems that used other visualizations to
    display additional information. For instance, Surasak et al. [168] visualized
    the temperature and humidity in a virtual gauge. Lagarda-Leyva et al. [179] displayed
    route completion time in a chart and vehicle capacity usage in a virtual gauge.
    These visualizations provided additional information for justifying food quality
    or improving supply chain processes, which could be a complement of our five visualization
    types. In case of a lot of information exist, either with one or multiple types
    of visualization, proper information organization should be considered. The usability
    study with 35 customers by Oliveira et al. [180] found some customers asking for
    sections of, for example, traceability or recipes, instead of only having one
    big page with all content. D. Other Aspects of User Interface In this section,
    we revisit the benefits and challenges discussed in Section IV and see how user
    interfaces relate to or address other points from stakeholders and traceability.
    We also include articles without screenshots or in non-agri-food supply chain
    domains, which could be a complement or potentially useful for agri-food traceability
    applications. 1) Privacy Designing blockchain-based traceability systems generally
    includes determining the privacy level - whether they are private, permission,
    or public blockchains. Still, the discussion about the selection of privacy level
    is not sufficient nor does the privacy level reflects in the user interface. In
    a general blockchain application, Cabinakova et al. [182] compared user acceptance
    of centralized and decentralized identity management systems, in which the decentralized
    system includes buttons to toggle disclosed personal information. They found that
    this control was a strong predictor of perceived transparency as well as user
    willingness to disclose data and users’ attitude. More consideration of privacy
    control of stakeholders in a supply chain could be beneficial to the traceability
    system. 2) Efficiency While Galvez et al. [8] and several works (e.g., [163],
    [164]) mentioned or used smart contracts as a way to improve efficiency in an
    agri-food supply chain, we found no works that discuss a user interface for a
    smart contract in this domain. Research of blockchain in general presents few
    works regarding user interface for smart contracts. Gul et al. [183] designed
    a smart contract interface for a user-centric business model in the blockchain.
    They suggested using a menu-based and filled form-based approach to create a smart
    contract for productivity and ease of use. Created contracts are immutable as
    they are based on blockchain technology. In practice, however, applications sometimes
    require updating of such immutable contracts. Hence, Kafeza et al. [184] proposed
    a versioning system of smart contracts using rental agreement smart contract as
    a case study. The interface included a simple form to upload the contract as well
    as a list of contract names and action buttons to, for example, deploy or terminate
    a contract. Nissen et al. [185] addressed another possibility of smart contracts
    by excluding the underlying contract from a user interface. They attached smart
    contract logic to physical locations, and the users only observed the result of
    the executed contracts through physical exploration and the changes to their balance.
    3) Sustainability Sutopo et al. [173] provided a user interface to input farmer
    and retailer data. Based on their computation, they then used data tables and
    charts to show details for improving vegetable quality and farmers’ abilities.
    Tallyn et al. [27] proposed autonomous coffee machines that allowed provenance
    of purchasing data, reducing intermediaries, and options to vote for future supplies.
    For voting, the screen showed results of supply chain analysis and used text,
    grouped as cards, to display the best supply for each criterium: “Best Quality”,
    “Low Environmental Impact”, “Best Social Responsibility”, and “Best Price.” They
    deployed the system in 3 offices and conducted a user study with 13 participants
    in the office. Their main conclusions included (1) minimizing the use of monetary
    rewards, (2) providing adequate information about the state of the machine, and
    (3) situating information about long-term thinking (such as provenance, environment,
    or value) in time and people’s routines. These findings provided implications
    for blockchain in everyday life as well as wider social structures and values.
    4) Cost and Risk Stakeholders may have limited education and required skills to
    use a blockchain-based application. Blockchain education is still immature with
    a limited number of universities offering blockchain courses [186]. Instead of
    relying on education, several papers addressed this issue by providing familiar
    interfaces to users. Bumblauskas et al. [126], for example, integrated blockchain
    with internal traceability software, hardware, and data entry from a system operator.
    Similarly, Iftekhar et al. [187] merged an enterprise-ready blockchain platform
    with existing conventional infrastructure. In a general context, Teruel and Trujillo
    [188] used a conceptual modeling approach and provided a middleware of blockchain-based
    employee schedule tracker for non-blockchain users. With the middleware, users
    could use a blockchain-based application as they did with a standard web application,
    i.e., by using usernames, passwords, and user interface elements instead of addresses,
    private keys, or transactions. They measured System Usability Score (SUS) with
    38 participants and found that the middleware was more usable and reduced task
    performance time. Rahman et al. [189] proposed a gesture-based user interface
    of a blockchain-based smart health monitoring system for elderly people or people
    with special needs. Seitz et al. [190] used blockchain to trace application installations
    on edge devices. They proposed an augmented reality that allowed user interaction
    with devices in an industrial environment. 5) Scalability One prominent scalability
    issue that relates to user interface design is latency. The limit for keeping
    the user’s attention is 10 seconds, and the limit for the user to feel instantaneously
    response is 0.1 second [191]. Cong An et al. [167] proposed a system that took
    15 seconds to create a block. Compared to the Proof-of-Work consensus protocol
    that could take 10 minutes, 15 seconds is very fast. Yet, based on the time limit
    suggestion, a user could notice the latency. In a general context, Nissen et al.
    [185] discussed that long transaction time disrupted user tasks. To address the
    issue, they added a “confirmed” for the trusted transaction and an “unconfirmed”
    for value to be updated. Their solution could be a good complement to only trying
    to improve the performance of a blockchain application. 6) Security User interface
    design related to security generally leads to the choice between public-private
    key authentication, as seen in the work by Iftekhar et al. [187], or username-password
    authentication, as seen in the work by Shaikh et al. [164]. One factor to determine
    which implementation is education and skills of the target users, as discussed
    in the cost and risk. 7) Infrastructure Infrastructure could affect user design
    choices. Idrees et al. [177] conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 farmers
    in Pakistan and found that majority of farmers have access to a smartphone. Hence,
    they designed an Android application and leveraged SMS to disseminate weather
    information. The choice of a device implies a screen size, which influences both
    how to collect and visualize the data. For instance, mobile phones usually come
    with GPS, which could be used to automatically get location data. Mobile applications
    typically prefer vertical timelines (e.g., as in [126], [169]) due to limited
    width. SECTION VI. Discussion In the previous two sections, we summarize the benefits
    and challenges of blockchain as well as categorize user interfaces, which briefly
    correspond to the benefits and challenges. In this section, we connect them together
    to determine research gaps, which researchers could address to ease the design
    process of the blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications and increase
    their usability. Overall, blockchain for the agri-food supply chain has a lot
    of potentials, which still need to be confirmed through practical implementations.
    From Table 2, seven review papers discussed the benefits and challenges of blockchain
    in agri-food supply chain application based on 119 unique references. Surprisingly,
    97 references were not picked up by our queries. A notable number of references
    came from general or other domains. This finding could imply that convincing cases
    of blockchain-based agri-food traceability are still scarce. Tribis et al. [48]
    suggested that real performance evaluation is still lacking, and from our point
    of view, user involvement and evaluation are also lacking. Compared to the traditional
    applications, fewer numbers of blockchain-based applications involved users (see
    Table 3 and Table 4). One common potential benefit and goal of blockchain-based
    agri-food supply chain applications is to provide trustworthy traceability information
    to customers. From Table 3 and Table 4, user interfaces for customers came from
    the blockchain-based applications more than from the traditional applications.
    Such customer involvement will increase the importance of user interfaces since
    customers may lack the motivation to be trained how to use the applications. Other
    stakeholders, who can be motivated by the business advantages, may also find difficulty
    in adopting this complex technology if the user interfaces are hard to use. Training
    cost tends to outweigh the design cost for better user interfaces. Blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications involve a relatively wide range of user types,
    while the underlying technology is relatively complex compared to other applications.
    We speculate that its nature requires additional considerations when designing
    the interface. For instance, one of the usability components involves an easy
    reversal of user errors [26], which is prevented by the immutability property
    of the blockchain. More considerations should be put on error prevention, such
    that farmers with limited knowledge of the technology may not enter incorrect
    information. Regardless, we cannot confirm the need for additional considerations.
    This is because of the relatively limited discussion about the user interfaces
    in the reviewed literature. Furthermore, most of the reviewed literature did not
    provide or provided only a limited evaluation of the user interfaces. Though the
    screenshots provide fairly rich information about the user interfaces, they may
    not illustrate all of the features of the applications. Due to this limitation,
    this paper avoids evaluating the interfaces, even by using design heuristics.
    With the current state of research, it is difficult to draw out design guidelines
    specifically for blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. Thus, we
    suggest future research efforts to include details on user interface and design
    decisions in their works, involve users in development and evaluation, and consider
    user interfaces to enhance benefits and address challenges of the applications.
    A. More Details on User Interface and Design Decisions We found that papers rarely
    explain their user interfaces and why they designed those user interface features.
    We speculate each input and visualization type to be useful in different situations.
    For instance, five visualization types could emphasize different aspects of information:
    the formatted text could be just a simple way to present all information; the
    table could facilitate a detailed comparison of data, which may be suitable for
    supply chain management but too excessive for customers; the timeline could emphasize
    time, which should be useful for the products with a short or sensitive shelf-life;
    the graph could emphasize steps, which could be useful to oversee the supply chain
    process; the map could emphasize locations, which could be used to promote local
    specialty or detect area-based issues such as water pollution. Still, we lack
    the detailed explanation to confirm these suggestions. We encourage researchers
    to include the user interface details and design decisions so that others could
    justify whether the features are useful for their applications. B. More User Involvement
    and Evaluation We found that relatively few works reported details of user opinions
    regarding user interface or usability, though many applications originated from
    analyzing business case studies that involved stakeholders in their development.
    There are very limited evaluations and guidelines to tell how features should
    be designed. For instance, designers may want to emphasize locations on a map,
    but the information to be displayed on the map will require preferences from the
    target users. Business entities may prefer all data visible for management while
    customers may overwhelm by those data. The designers may need to evaluate different
    types of map representations (e.g., satellite and road map), similar to Violino
    et al. [181] that evaluated the label types (NFC, RFID, and QR code). As users
    in an agri-food supply chain have different backgrounds and skills, we believe
    that user study is important to find which user interface features are suitable
    for which users in which context. C. More Considerations of User Interfaces Our
    analysis in Section V could serve as a starting point for considering user interfaces
    in blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. For instance, gathering
    inputs through forms should be more flexible but more time-consuming and error-prone
    compared to other methods. Proper form design, e.g., with autocompletion and validation,
    could reduce error and time taking to enter the information. While visual feedback
    such as percent-done indicator [192] is not the solution to latency issues, it
    helps users understand the waiting and reduce frustration. Designers may follow
    learnability guidelines (e.g., [193]) to reduce costs related to limited education
    and required skills. We believe that better user interface design could enhance
    the benefits and address the challenges of the blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications, thus easing the adoption of the blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications. SECTION VII. Conclusion Blockchain technology is seen as a way to
    improve agri-food supply chain traceability and deliver food quality, safety,
    and nutrition information to stakeholders. While there are a lot of works on blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability, relatively few works paid attention to user interfaces.
    Limited knowledge on how to design the user interface for the traceability application
    could lead to usability issues. As a step towards more usable blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications, this paper reviewed existing works from a
    user interface perspective. We examined 7 review papers to understand the benefits
    and challenges that the blockchain brings to stakeholders, businesses, and technology
    for the agri-food supply chain. We analyzed 24 papers containing user interfaces
    related to blockchain and/or agri-food traceability for target users and user
    interface purposes. We summarized three ways to collect the traceability data
    (form entry, label scanning, and sensor transmission), five ways to visualize
    the traceability data (formatted text, table, timeline, graph, and map), as well
    as other aspects of the user interfaces. In the end, we encouraged researchers
    to include details on user interface and design decisions in their works, involve
    users in development and evaluation, and consider user interfaces to enhance benefits
    and address challenges of the applications. We believe that better user interface
    design is one factor to widen blockchain adoption in the future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    city that covered to the full extent of various components. Thus, this study explores
    the integration of blockchain technology in making the city smarter, safer and
    sustainable. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted a systematic literature
    review of 49 publications published globally. Data were analysed by coding of
    the publications whereby the codes were generated based on frequency of appearance
    (n). Findings The results showed that smart sustainable city could leverage blockchain
    technology in several areas such as governance, mobility, asset, utility, healthcare
    and logistics. Blockchain technology could also aid smart sustainable city in
    achieving social, environmental and economic sustainability. Originality/value
    This study proposes a smart sustainable city with blockchain technology framework:
    guiding city planners and policymakers by deploying blockchain that supports technology
    within smart sustainable city framework. This facilitates the digital transformation
    of a city towards smart and sustainable through the use of blockchain. Keywords

    \ have accelerated the development of smart cities. The \nsmart city concept represents\
    \ the next generation of urbanization (Li et al. 2016). Calvillo \net al. (2016)\
    \ described a smart city as \"a sustainable and efficient urban centre that pro-\n\
    vides a high quality of life to its inhabitants through optimal management of\
    \ its resources.\" \nAside from maintaining an advanced physical infrastructure,\
    \ smart cities are characterized \nby the availability, integrity and quality\
    \ of knowledge communication and social infra-\nstructure (Caragliu et al. 2011).\n\
    In a smart city, advanced technologies and intelligent networks constitute the\
    \ critical \nenablers for the effective functioning of the city. Critical components\
    \ of a smart city eco-\nsystem, including its broad infrastructure (e.g., mass\
    \ transit, emergency services, energy \ngrids) and government e-services (e.g.,\
    \ health services, permits, applications and approv-\nals), interoperate in real-time.\
    \ The wireless communication networks, coupled with self-\norganizing and self-healing\
    \ networks, are critical in smart city realization. High-speed, \nreal-time security\
    \ protocols constitute a crucial component in the smart city ecosystem by \nproviding\
    \ the necessary security services in authentication, confidentiality, integrity\
    \ and \navailability (Rathore et al. 2018).\nAlmost all smart applications continuously\
    \ generate large amounts of data from het-\nerogeneous sources. However, current\
    \ database technologies do not effectively manage \nand securely store voluminous\
    \ data. Sensors, devices, and vehicles connected through the \nInternet pose privacy\
    \ risks and security concerns (Dwivedi et al. 2019). Although emerg-\ning technologies\
    \ have overcome many infrastructure problems related to ageing infrastruc-\nture\
    \ and the increasing demands of citizens for better services, the benefits of\
    \ the smart \ncity and urban improvement are not yet realized (Berglund et al.\
    \ 2020). New technologies \nhave paved the way for numerous opportunities for\
    \ additional value creation; however, the \nprogress of smart cities is still\
    \ facing several challenges. A sustainable smart city should \nenhance the quality\
    \ of life of its population through improved data security, privacy, effi-\ncient\
    \ information sharing, effective decision-making, and high-quality services.\n\
    The emergence of blockchain technology promises vast improvements for smart city\
    \ \napplications. According to Treiblmaier (2018, p. 547), blockchain is defined\
    \ as \"a digital, \ndecentralized and distributed ledger in which transactions\
    \ are logged and added in chron-\nological order with the goal of creating permanent\
    \ and tamperproof records.\" Rejeb et al. \n(2018, 2019, 2020a, b) argue that\
    \ blockchain constitutes a combination of multiple tech-\nnologies, tools and\
    \ methods that can be used for specific problems and business use cases. \nBlockchain\
    \ technology has advanced as a potential solution to complex or persistent chal-\n\
    lenges within the smart city by enhancing transparency and providing a trust and\
    \ account-\nability layer through its transaction immutability. Blockchain technology\
    \ can transform \nsmart city infrastructures, alter ecosystems for enhanced consumer\
    \ services, and facilitate \ninnovative applications. Blockchain is considered\
    \ a new engine of growth and prosperity \nin the smart city as it enhances efficiencies,\
    \ secures the communication of sensitive data, \nand increases the interoperability\
    \ of smart city platforms. Besides underpinning cryptocur-\nrencies, researchers\
    \ and analysts envision that blockchain applications will span various \nsectors\
    \ and help redefine global urban development through the protection of transactions\
    \ \nand other services (Marsal-Llacuna 2018). Previous studies have attempted\
    \ to review the \nexisting applications of blockchain in the context of smart\
    \ cities (Bernabe et al. 2019; Li \net al. 2019), but to the best of our knowledge,\
    \ no previous study has reviewed blockchain \nand smart city research using bibliometric\
    \ tools such as keyword co-occurrence network \n2877\nBlockchain technology in the smart\
    \ city: a bibliometric review \n1 3\nand article co-citation analyses. This study\
    \ provides a systematic bibliometric review on \nblockchain research from the\
    \ smart city perspective to close this knowledge gap. In review-\ning the literature,\
    \ we aimed to understand the current state-of-the-art and fulfil the fol-\nlowing\
    \ objectives: reveal the evolution of blockchain and smart city research, identify\
    \ the \nmajor contributing countries, and catalogue the publishing journals. The\
    \ use of bibliomet-\nric tools serves to unfold the core content of blockchain-smart\
    \ city research, the structure \nof co-cited articles, and the influential studies\
    \ in the literature. Our main goal is to obtain a \nfocused but detailed overview\
    \ of the body of research. More specifically, in this investiga-\ntion, we attempt\
    \ to answer the following research questions (RQs):\n• RQ1 How did blockchain\
    \ and smart city research evolve since their inception?\n• RQ2 What are the leading\
    \ countries and journals publishing blockchain and smart city-\nrelated studies?\n\
    • RQ3 What are the critical research hotspots in blockchain and smart city research?\n\
    • RQ4 Which articles are the most influential in the academic literature?\nThis\
    \ study is structured as five sections. After the introduction, we present the\
    \ research \nmethodology adopted in this study. Section 3 discusses the review’s\
    \ findings, including \nthe temporal distribution of publications, the countries\
    \ contributing to blockchain research, \nand the main publication outlets. In\
    \ Sect. 4, we present the results of the keyword co-occur-\nrence network along\
    \ with the article co-citation analysis. Section 5 provides a discussion of \n\
    current and future trends and challenges in blockchain-smart city research, followed\
    \ by the \nlimitations of the study, the potential research directions, and the\
    \ managerial implications. \nThe last section briefly concludes the paper.\n2\
    \  Research methodology\n2.1  Data collection\nTo investigate the current state-of-the-art\
    \ of blockchain applications in the smart city, \nwe conducted a bibliometric\
    \ literature review. This type of review allows researchers to \nsynthesize previous\
    \ scholarly knowledge and inspire future research works. According to \nÁlvarez-García\
    \ et al. (2018), the power of bibliometric reviews lies in their capability to\
    \ \nidentify and classify a wide variety of documents within a specific area and\
    \ to facilitate the \nanalysis of information in order to show the trends based\
    \ on synthesized data. Similarly, \nthe use of bibliometric reviews ensures objectivity\
    \ and offers unique insights into the liter-\nature (Koseoglu, 2016). Using bibliometric\
    \ techniques, scholars can depict the conceptual \nspace of a given research field\
    \ and facilitate the interpretation of the findings.\nThe initial step of the\
    \ bibliometric review consists of identifying the most suitable \ndatabase for\
    \ the study. For the selection of articles, we carried out searches in the Scopus\
    \ \ndatabase. The capability of the database to handle bibliographic references\
    \ and quantify \ncitations has made Scopus a widely used instrument for the analysis\
    \ of any research field. \nApart from this, Scopus is one of the most highly regarded\
    \ academic databases globally, \nindexing approximately 70% more sources than\
    \ the Web of Science (Brzezinski 2015). As \nper Harzing and Alakangas (2016),\
    \ Scopus is one of the largest and trusted data reposi-\ntories for peer-reviewed\
    \ academic journals, books, chapters and conference proceedings \ncovering various\
    \ disciplines and depicting the dynamics of science and technology. We \n 2878\n\
    A. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\nconducted our search using the title, abstract, and keywords\
    \ fields by inserting the follow-\ning query and a Boolean operator; Blockchain\
    \ AND \"smart cit*\".\nUsing the outline of several studies as a reference, we\
    \ considered only articles published \nin academic journals to analyze and develop\
    \ bibliometric indicators. The selection of jour-\nnal articles helps to ensure\
    \ the reliability and academic nature of the analysis (Ramos-Rod-\nríguez and\
    \ Ruíz-Navarro 2004) because these resources provide a representative sample \n\
    of international scientific activity. To widen coverage, we considered all publications\
    \ in \nthe English language. All journal articles published before 2021 were considered.\
    \ After \nthis step, the Scopus database returned 162 documents. To further refine\
    \ the results, we \nlimited the subject areas to engineering, computer science,\
    \ social sciences, business, man-\nagement and accounting, decision sciences,\
    \ and economics. For clarity and transparency, \nthe advanced search function\
    \ used in Scopus is illustrated in Annex 1. Our review of past \nstudies focused\
    \ on identifying the connection of blockchain technology with the smart city.\
    \ \nTherefore, priorities were given to the previously mentioned disciplines.\
    \ The number of \narticles considered was reduced to 150. Each of these articles\
    \ was carefully screened for \nrelevance by reading the title, the abstract and\
    \ the keywords. Eventually, 148 journal arti-\ncles were retrieved for the final\
    \ review and analysis (two of the 150 articles were consid-\nered “false positives”\
    \ for the search result). Our sample included all articles that present the \n\
    applications of blockchain technology in smart cities. The review procedure followed\
    \ to \nobtain these articles, along with the eligibility criteria, is depicted\
    \ in Fig. 1.\n2.2  Bibliometric methods\nAfter the descriptive analysis of the\
    \ selected publications, we carried out a deeper exami-\nnation of the content\
    \ (i.e., keywords) and the relationships among the articles to obtain \nmore insights.\
    \ Network analysis was employed based on bibliometric data to depict the \nnetwork\
    \ structure of blockchain-smart city research by using the visualization software\
    \ \nVOSviewer (Eck and Waltman 2009).\nFig. 1  The literature review procedure\
    \ and eligibility criteria\n2879\nBlockchain technology in the smart city: a bibliometric\
    \ review \n1 3\nA keyword co-occurrence analysis was performed to generate a more\
    \ in-depth examina-\ntion of the blockchain-smart city research field. This analysis\
    \ helps to reveal the interac-\ntion between the different research directions\
    \ and partition the field of knowledge (Ding \net al. 2001). Unlike co-citation\
    \ analysis, which is based on clustering the related references \ninto groups\
    \ according to their link strength (Zheng et al. 2017), keyword co-occurrence\
    \ \nnetwork analysis extracts author-supplied keywords in each publication and\
    \ analyses their \nco-occurrence frequency (Ding et al. 2001). The high proximity\
    \ of two keywords means \nthat they are found in the same publications more frequently.\
    \ To depict the structure of the \nfield, VOSviewer was used because of its compatibility\
    \ with Bibexcel and its ability to cre-\nate the co-occurrence network. Moreover,\
    \ we used the LinLog/modularity normalization \nmethod to display the clusters\
    \ of keywords. This algorithm minimizes the distance between \nconnected nodes,\
    \ i.e., keywords (Newman 2004; Noack 2007).\nCo-citation analysis was introduced\
    \ by Small (1973). It was employed to investigate \nand visualize the dynamic\
    \ aspects of blockchain-smart city research. The analysis of co-\ncited articles\
    \ enables researchers to explore the links between such co-cited sources (Chen\
    \ \net al. 2010). As one of the most common relational techniques, article co-citation\
    \ analy-\nsis assumes an association between two publications if they are both\
    \ cited in subsequent \nstudies (Small 1973). Co-citation patterns and frequency\
    \ help identify knowledge domains \nsince higher co-citation frequencies between\
    \ two publications suggest stronger relation-\nships, uniformity of references\
    \ and collective knowledge (Fang et al. 2018). In this paper, \nVOSviewer was\
    \ used to generate the article co-citation network. Initially, the output file\
    \ \nfrom Bibexcel was loaded into VOSviewer. Several steps were followed to generate\
    \ the \narticle co-citation map. Before importing data to VOSviewer, we pre-processed\
    \ the biblio-\nmetric data of our sample, and we set a threshold of two co-citations\
    \ to be shown for the \nanalysis. As a result, a document with a co-citation frequency\
    \ below two is not considered \nin the co-citation analysis. As blockchain-smart\
    \ city research is still in a nascent stage, \nwe noted that setting a high threshold\
    \ would lead to over filtering and the display of few \narticles in the visualization\
    \ network. The clustering of research topics was displayed using \nnormalization\
    \ with the LinLog/modularity algorithm (Newman 2004; Noack 2007). The \nthickness\
    \ of the edges reflects the strength of the relationship between co-cited articles.\n\
    3  Findings\n3.1  Distribution of publications by year\nThe search was performed\
    \ on the 5th of January, 2021. Figure 2 illustrates the number of \njournal articles\
    \ published by year and extracted from the execution of the research proce-\n\
    dure. The first article that addresses the applications of blockchain technology\
    \ in the smart \ncity appeared in 2016. According to Rosati and Conti (2016),\
    \ “smart city” has been used \nas a term since at least 2009 and several sources\
    \ highlight that blockchain was first intro-\nduced in 2008. Our research reveals\
    \ it took 7–8 years for the joint usage of blockchain and \nsmart city in a research\
    \ paper authored by Sun et al. (2016), who studied the contribution \nof blockchain\
    \ technology in supporting the development of shared services in smart cities.\
    \ \nIn 2017, one article was published by Sharma et al. (2017), where the authors\
    \ investigated \nthe potentials of blockchain technology for intelligent transport\
    \ systems. According to this \nstudy, blockchain could be used to design more\
    \ intelligent, secure, distributed, and autono-\nmous transport systems. From\
    \ 2018 onward, there is a significant increase in the annual \n 2880\nA. Rejeb\
    \ et al.\n1 3\nvolume of articles, peaking in 2020 with 92 papers. As shown in\
    \ Fig. 2, the number of \narticles published in 2018 increased significantly compared\
    \ to the previous years. How-\never, the scholarly output in 2019 and 2020 doubled\
    \ from the previous year. Two factors \ncan explain the growing interest level\
    \ in blockchain applications in the smart city: first, \nthe number of scholars\
    \ worldwide has increased tremendously, concomitantly increasing \nthe number\
    \ of submissions to journals. Second, a high number of smart city-focused and\
    \ \nblockchain-based decentralized applications are being developed (Kundu 2019).\
    \ This find-\ning is consistent with Li et al. (2019), who argue that smart energy\
    \ and smart government \napplications are at an advanced stage with blockchain\
    \ implementations. The interest in \nblockchain has also rapidly increased in\
    \ other sectors such as healthcare (Bernabe et al. \n2019), sharing services (Sun\
    \ et al. 2016), transportation (Astarita et al. 2020), and energy \n(Makhdoom\
    \ et al. 2020; Park et al. 2018; Tanwar et al. 2020). At the time of writing,\
    \ we \nanticipate the number of publications incorporating blockchain technologies\
    \ and smart \ncities will experience an exponential increase in the coming years,\
    \ entering a ‘maturing \nphase’ of adoption and continued strong levels of academic\
    \ attention and focus.\n3.2  Distribution of publications by country\nTo study\
    \ the country-wise distribution of the selected papers, we extracted the authors’\
    \ \naffiliations. From Fig. 3, it is observed that a significant contribution\
    \ to the blockchain and \nsmart city literature came from China, India and the\
    \ USA, with 32, 27 and 27 papers each, \nrespectively. This is not surprising\
    \ as China has up to 300 cities with pilot projects for \nsmart city construction\
    \ (Sun et al. 2016). In such projects, blockchain is expected to enable \nsmart\
    \ cities and provide citizens with high-quality services. Related to the development\
    \ \nof practical solutions for urban areas, China represents one of the leading\
    \ countries that \nhas promoted the adoption of blockchain for the authentication\
    \ of data (Li et al. 2019), \nthe security of imaging sensors for surveillance\
    \ (Khan et al. 2020), the support of foreign \nexchange trade systems (Aggarwal\
    \ et al. 2019), and the traceability of supply chains (Rejeb \net al. 2020a, b,\
    \ 2021a; Shen and Pena-Mora 2018). In India, Prime Minister Modi’s flagship \n\
    project— the Smart Cities Mission— has placed a core emphasis on cutting-edge\
    \ technolo-\ngies such as blockchain in the country (Team Inc42 2018). The government\
    \ of India has \nofficially initiated the implementation of blockchain in the\
    \ port city of Vishakhapatnam to \n1\n1\n17\n37\n92\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\

    \ city: a bibliometric review \n1 3\nsecure digital transactions, maintain land\
    \ records, and streamline automobile registrations \n(Bragadeesh and Umamakeswari\
    \ 2018). The interest in blockchain has expanded rapidly \nin the past decade\
    \ in the United States, where the scope of the technology extends from \ncryptocurrencies\
    \ to public services, including accounting and taxation (Keibler 2019). The \n\
    impetus for improved data management and space communications in various interplane-\n\
    tary space missions has urged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\
    \ (NASA) \nto consider blockchain technology for the development of an autonomous\
    \ spacecraft sys-\ntem called the Resilient Networking and Computing Paradigm\
    \ (RNCP) (Ismail and Mater-\nwala 2019). \nSimilarly, the Cook County Recorder\
    \ of Deeds in Chicago initiated a project to test how \ndigital property abstracts\
    \ could be created and managed using blockchain (Kundu 2019). \nWith the blockchain\
    \ implementation, US State authorities and local governments aspire to \nimprove\
    \ the public and private sector services, enhance the relationship between govern-\n\
    ment and citizens, and make operational and commissioning activities over smart\
    \ urban \ninfrastructures intrinsically secure and efficient. Scholars from South\
    \ Korea have contrib-\nuted to the literature with 17 studies. Researchers from\
    \ the United Kingdom (UK), Aus-\ntralia, and Spain have also contributed substantially\
    \ to the literature with 15, 13, and 11 \npapers, respectively. It should be noted\
    \ that the category \"Others\" comprises all countries \nwith less than five papers\
    \ (total papers from such countries = 35).\n3.3  Distribution of publications\
    \ by journal\nThe retrieved papers appeared in a wide variety of academic journals.\
    \ Figure 4 presents the \njournals publishing on blockchain and the smart city\
    \ and the respective number of articles. \nThe 148 articles were published in\
    \ 76 journals. In terms of output, IEEE Access was the \njournal publishing the\
    \ highest number of articles (n = 15). IEEE Internet of Things Journal \nand Future\
    \ Generation Computer Systems published 10 and 6 articles, respectively. The \n\
    remaining journals on the list published either four or five articles each. The\
    \ category \"Oth-\ners\" consists of 66 journals that published less than four\
    \ articles on blockchain applications \nin the smart city. In total, these journals\
    \ published 85 papers. Taking a closer look at the \nscope of all journals, we\
    \ observed that research on blockchain in the smart city context \n32\n27\n27\n\

    Meanwhile, journals with a strong orientation toward management, business, urban\
    \ sci-\nences, and social sciences have published few articles on the subject.\
    \ As a result, this sug-\ngests that the low output from these journals may be\
    \ explained by either few submissions \nor high rejections if not aligned with\

    \ scholars to examine the intricacies of blockchain research from the smart city\
    \ \nperspective.\n4  Bibliometric analysis\n4.1  Keyword co‑occurrence network\n\
    The analysis of keyword co-occurrence network assists researchers in identifying\
    \ the fun-\ndamental topics discussed in a particular research area. In this respect,\
    \ Zupic and Čater \n(2015) state that keyword co-occurrence is a useful scientometric\
    \ technique that enables \nvisualization and displaying the similarities present\
    \ among frequently co-occurring key-\nwords or topics in the literature. With\
    \ this bibliometric technique, scholars can obtain a \nbroad idea of the content\
    \ of a paper and essential information relating to methods, objec-\ntives, and\
    \ viewpoints. To map the keyword co-occurrence network, we pre-treated and \n\
    adjusted the original keywords whenever it was necessary. For instance, we merged\
    \ similar \nkeywords such as \"smart city\" and \"smart cities\", \"blockchain\"\
    \ and \"blockchain technol-\nogy\". After performing some data refinements, we\
    \ set the threshold of keyword co-occur-\nrence at a minimum of two in VOSviewer\
    \ and generated the co-occurrence network visu-\nalization of content. As illustrated\
    \ in Fig. 5, six clusters emerged, with 89 nodes appearing \nin the network. Each\
    \ node in the visualization constitutes a keyword; the node’s size is \nproportional\
    \ to the occurrence of the keyword in the reviewed literature. In other words,\
    \ \nlarger nodes indicate a higher frequency of keyword co-occurrence. Keywords\

    \ in the network. Hence, all authors’ keywords \nwere arranged in six clusters\
    \ with a different level of significance.\n4.1.1  The combination of blockchain\
    \ and IoT in smart cities\nBased on the size, the red cluster represents the most\
    \ significant, containing several key-\nwords that are strongly related to blockchain’s\
    \ foundational components, the IoT, and \na wide range of technologies that could\
    \ be leveraged in the smart city. These include \n\"blockchain\", “smart city”\
    \ \"IoT\", \"SDN\" (Software-Defined Networking), \"Edge Com-\nputing\", \"Fog\
    \ Computing\", \"Authentication\", \"IoV\" (Internet of Vehicles), \"ITS\" (Intel-\n\
    ligent Transport System), and \"healthcare\". The introduction of blockchain technology\
    \ \nhelps to establish an architecture that ensures improved security and privacy\
    \ in smart \ncommunities (Aggarwal et al. 2019; Bernabe et al. 2019), unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle com-\nmunications (Mehta et al. 2020), IoT devices (Kamran et al.\
    \ 2020; Singh et al. 2019; Xu \net al. 2018), crowdsourcing services (Lin et al.\
    \ 2020; Stoyanova et al. 2020), healthcare \n(Dwivedi et al. 2019; Khatoon 2020;\
    \ Rejeb et al. 2021a, b), and supply chain manage-\nment (Astarita et al. 2020;\
    \ Mistry et al. 2020). The high co-occurrence of blockchain \nwith IoT, as shown\
    \ by the thick edge connecting them in the network, reflects the criti-\ncality\
    \ of these technologies to change the way smart citizens interact, think, live,\
    \ and \nFig. 5  The keyword co-occurrence network\n 2884\nA. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\n\
    manage information. The pervasiveness of IoT technologies can optimize information\
    \ \ncapture, facilitate data communication, and substantiate the value of blockchain\
    \ for the \ndevelopment of smart cities. Besides IoT and blockchain, the high\
    \ occurrence of ITS \nand healthcare in the author keywords field likely indicates\
    \ that most of published works \nfocused on the examination of blockchain’s potential\
    \ for transportation and healthcare \nactivities in the smart city.\nBlockchain\
    \ constitutes a viable solution to overcome several challenges facing trans-\n\
    portation activities such as congestion, emissions, and accidents. According to\
    \ Gupta \net al. (2021), blockchain can also be used to mitigate security concerns\
    \ of connected \nautomated vehicles, including vehicle hacking, traffic congestion,\
    \ information disclo-\nsure, spoofing, eavesdropping, Sybil, replay, data alteration,\
    \ and DoS attacks. In addi-\ntion, the technology can underpin a privacy-preserving,\
    \ open, and trustless architecture \nfor mobility services for citizens (Ahad\
    \ et al. 2020). By deploying a blockchain-based \nIoV, it is possible to improve\
    \ road traffic sustainability by reducing energy consump-\ntion, optimizing safety,\
    \ and minimizing pollution. The introduction of blockchain and \nthe transition\
    \ from fuel-based vehicles to blockchain-based electric and autonomous \nvehicles\
    \ have the potential to advance new business models in which mobility as a ser-\n\
    vice replaces the existing car ownership paradigms. As a result, citizens will\
    \ be able to \nbenefit from a high level of smart mobility, real-time tracking\
    \ of public transportation, \nefficient payment services, sufficient space for\
    \ parking, and convenient micro-mobility \n(e.g., finding and tracking scooters\
    \ or e-bikes with blockchain-based applications).\nIn the healthcare sector, blockchain\
    \ is a promising technology that can provide \ndecentralization in healthcare\
    \ networks, improving data provenance and enhancing net-\nwork security (Bhushan\
    \ et al. 2020). Medical professionals can securely store patients’ \nhealth data\
    \ in a blockchain that can be configured to enable interoperability across dif-\n\
    ferent healthcare entities. Moreover, blockchain systems can provide real-time\
    \ access \nto patients’ medical records and ensure protection against data manipulations\
    \ that are \notherwise difficult to trace, like adding or removing drug allergy\
    \ information, thereby \novercoming critical patient safety and institutional\
    \ trust concerns (S. Singh et al. 2020a, \nb). From a patients’ perspective, blockchain\
    \ can be augmented with identity manage-\nment tools that provide a secure access\
    \ framework to medical records and safeguard \npatient privacy. Data can be accessed\
    \ only by authorized healthcare actors and enti-\nties. To provide appropriate\
    \ and timely medical interventions and treatments, health-\ncare organizations\
    \ could utilize a blockchain-based system to obtain a full record of the \npatients’\
    \ personal health records and diagnoses notes, enabling real-time decision mak-\n\
    ing while reducing patient risk and enhancing the quality of care. Similarly,\
    \ blockchain \ncan streamline the processes related to medical insurance claims\
    \ because the technology \nenables the reduction of the layers of intermediaries\
    \ involved in the insurance industry \n(Salha et al. 2019). The ease of secure\
    \ access to medical data via blockchain can shorten \nthe process of approval\
    \ of insurance, especially by reducing intermediaries.\nFrom a supply chain perspective,\
    \ blockchain can be utilized to control and track the \nflow of medicines and\
    \ reduce the risk of pharmaceutical counterfeits (Rejeb et al. 2021a, \nb). Thanks\
    \ to its fraud-resistant nature, blockchain is capable of reducing pharmaceuti-\n\
    cal waste and various manipulations of supply chain data. The origin of drugs\
    \ can be \ntraced efficiently by logging chronological transaction data generated\
    \ by IoT devices to \nthe blockchain. Therefore, blockchain brings several benefits\
    \ to the healthcare sector, \nranging from timely diagnoses and personalized healthcare\
    \ services to reduced paper-\nwork and increased pharmaceutical supply chain traceability.\n\
    2885\nBlockchain technology in the smart city: a bibliometric review \n1 3\n4.1.2\
    \  The role of machine learning in smart cities\nThe second significant cluster\
    \ is the green one, and it comprises terms such as \"ML\" \n(Machine Learning),\
    \ \"Smart Grids\", \"Data Security\", \"Privacy-Preserving\", \"Reli-\nability\"\
    , \"Anomaly Detection\", \"Crowdsensing\". According to Tanwar et al. (2020),\
    \ the \ncombination of blockchain and ML ensures data reliability and security,\
    \ which is neces-\nsary to provide accurate analytics for decision-making processes.\
    \ Coupled with block-\nchain, ML can precisely identify patterns, anomalies, and\
    \ support predictions based on \nthe enormous data generated by IoT applications\
    \ in the smart city, including transporta-\ntion, healthcare, energy, and weather\
    \ forecasting. The integration of ML and IoT has \nsuffered from some limitations,\
    \ such as the lack of effectiveness in output and the need \nto embed security\
    \ from the start (Kaur et al. 2020). For this reason, Salah et al. (2019a; \n\
    b) believe that blockchain can mitigate these limitations and offer scalability,\
    \ security, \nand execution of transactions by consensus protocols (e.g., Proof\
    \ of Work (PoW), Proof \nof Stake (PoS)). Kumar et al. (2021) aim to establish\
    \ trust management, privacy protec-\ntion, and intrusion detection by fusing blockchain\
    \ and ML. As such, the authors intend \nto develop a trustworthy privacy-preserving\
    \ secured framework for constructing a sus-\ntainable smart city. Likewise, Shen\
    \ et al. (2019) propose a new privacy-preserving train-\ning scheme based on blockchain\
    \ and ML to tackle the issues of data privacy and integ-\nrity and to develop\
    \ a secure training algorithm in multi-part contexts where IoT data \nis captured\
    \ from multiple data providers in the smart city. Overall, smart city design-\n\
    ers can take advantage of the powerful combination of blockchain and ML to develop\
    \ \nsecure and privacy-preserving applications.\nWith the exponential increase\
    \ in sensors, there is an emphasis on big data and data \nanalytics. These technological\
    \ advances pave the way for the establishment of data-\ndriven smart cities. Moreover,\
    \ there is an increased focus on smart grids as a critical \nfeature of emerging\
    \ energy scenarios with the all-embracing purpose of better balancing \nenergy\
    \ demand and generation. Smart grids embody a significant improvement in the \n\
    fundamental structure of power grids, which can be facilitated by blockchain implemen-\n\
    tation. For instance, blockchain can help address the security and privacy issues\
    \ encoun-\ntered during the trading of excess power among smart citizens. In line\
    \ with Jaiswal et al. \n(2020), blockchain can be utilized effectively to facilitate\
    \ electricity trade among user \nnetworks. Sadik et  al. (2020) posit that blockchain\
    \ holds the key to the automation \nof smart grids due to its ability to facilitate\
    \ energy trading, financing for renewables, \nenergy billing, and metering processes.\
    \ The technology also incites the joint operation \nof renewable sources with\
    \ their energy storage units, the easy assessment of service \ncharge, and the\
    \ flexible and reliable payments of energy transactions through cryptogra-\nphy.\
    \ Therefore, blockchain offers more secure energy transactions and trading in\
    \ a smart \ncity while reducing costs, maximizing utility, and supporting real-time\
    \ processing of \nenergy trading computation (Chaudhary et al. 2019).\nThe high\
    \ frequency of crowdsourcing in the cluster suggests that this paradigm can \n\
    benefit from the deployment of blockchain in the smart city. To be specific, blockchain\
    \ \nhas been used to link and automate data processing for mobile crowdsensing,\
    \ thereby \nlaying the foundation for several smart city applications like smart\
    \ parking. In this \ncontext, Kim and Kim (2020) design a multi-blockchain structure\
    \ for data management \nemploying mobile crowdsensing technology to develop a\
    \ smart parking system, which \nrepresents a key service for constructing smart\
    \ cities. Furthermore, by incorporating \npublic–private blockchain, the proposed\
    \ system is useful owing to the benefits of the \n 2886\nA. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\n\
    public blockchain (e.g., transaction immutability, cryptography, and data integrity)\
    \ and \nthe private blockchain (e.g., secure data sharing and management). As\
    \ a result, block-\nchain can secure information exchange among different participants\
    \ in mobile crowd-\nsensing networks and achieve decentralization of crowdsensing\
    \ to prevent the issues \nthat a central platform causes.\n4.1.3  The technical\
    \ characteristics of blockchain\nThe blue cluster is related to the technical\
    \ characteristics of blockchain technologies such \nas security, privacy, latency,\
    \ throughput, transparency, and trust. Interest in the technol-\nogy stems from\
    \ the fact that blockchain provides security, confidentiality, and data integ-\n\
    rity without the need for a third party to control transactions. Ensuring security\
    \ is becom-\ning primary for smart city administrators in order to mitigate cybercrimes.\
    \ To address \nthe security and privacy issues encountered by smart cities, there\
    \ is a need to integrate \nblockchain to make sure that certain security loopholes\
    \ do not continue to affect the rest \nof the smart city networks. Singh et al.\
    \ (2020a; b) note that blockchain can be utilized \nto enhance the security infrastructure\
    \ of big enterprises as open ledgers can induce fault-\nproof integration of connected\
    \ IoT devices in intelligent networks. This prevents problems \nlike data visibility\
    \ and end-to-end process tracking, transaction automation and checking, \nreal-time\
    \ data sharing across the network, and IoT network issues. Bhushan et al. (2020)\
    \ \ncontend that blockchain-based systems require minimum overall security monitoring\
    \ cost \nand offer protection from adversaries attempting to gain access to private\
    \ information or \ncontrol over the entire network. Moreover, the keyword \"AI\"\
    \ appeared frequently in the \ncluster, illustrating the criticality of this technology\
    \ to support the development of future \nsmart cities. AI intersects considerably\
    \ with blockchain to deliver bug-free smart contracts, \noptimize energy consumption,\
    \ learn from distributed data sources, improve system resil-\nience, and improve\
    \ the design of mining hardware to maximize system performance (S. \nSingh et al.\
    \ 2020a, b). In turn, blockchain complements AI and ensures data quality and \n\
    resistance against hacking and human mistakes thanks to its decentralization,\
    \ immutability, \nand transparency (Radu 2020). With the emergence of 5G networks,\
    \ there is a potential to \ndevelop vertical applications in the smart city by\
    \ connecting heterogeneous devices and \nequipment with substantial enhancements\
    \ in terms of high service quality, high network \ncapacity, and increased system\
    \ throughput (Nguyen et al. 2020). 5G networks facilitate the \nintegration of\
    \ IoT and provide access to the smart city infrastructure through control and\
    \ \nvirtual network functions (Capossele et al. 2018). The amalgamation of blockchain\
    \ and 5G \nallows detecting and preventing various attacks, improving network\
    \ latency, and provid-\ning better connectivity for smart city applications, including\
    \ smart logistics. In fact, logis-\ntics is recognized as the most suitable sector\
    \ for the introduction of blockchain technology. \nAccording to Astarita et al.\
    \ (2020), the relevance of blockchain for logistics is claimed for \nits traceability\
    \ and integration capabilities in supply chain management. It is also argued \n\
    that enhanced trust and data sharing among supply chain partners are among the\
    \ virtues of \nblockchain in logistics. The high frequency of the keyword \"Literature\
    \ Review\" indicates \nthat researchers widely used reviews to investigate the\
    \ security and privacy issues of block-\nchain and the role of AI and 5G networks\
    \ in reshaping smart cities. However, a bibliomet-\nric approach synthesizing\
    \ research on blockchain applications in smart cities is still lack-\ning, making\
    \ this study the first attempt to analyze this topical area using quantitative\
    \ tools.\n2887\nBlockchain technology in the smart city: a bibliometric review\
    \ \n1 3\n4.1.4  The role of smart contracts in smart cities\nThe most frequent\
    \ keywords in the yellow cluster are \"Smart Contracts\", \"Ethereum\", \n\"Access\
    \ Control\", \"Consensus\", and “Bitcoin”. The collection of these keywords sug-\n\
    gests that blockchain supports the programmability and the communication of the\
    \ mul-\ntiple heterogeneous, mobile, autonomous and robotics devices used in the\
    \ smart city \nthrough smart contracts. This cluster provides the first and second\
    \ generations of block-\nchain applications for developing a ledger that records\
    \ signed monetary transactions and \nprovides a general-purpose programmable infrastructure\
    \ using smart contracts (Kosba \net al. 2016). Smart contracts represent self-executing\
    \ computer programs (Szabo 1996) \nthat can be stored within the blockchain and\
    \ automatically activated if certain condi-\ntions are met (Liao and Wang 2018).\
    \ According to Liao and Wang (2018), blockchain-\nenabled smart contracts could\
    \ provide a perfect mixture of security, privacy and ease \nof use for performing\
    \ business transactions, exchanging cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ether, \nbitcoin)\
    \ and resources. By using smart contracts, blockchain can be leveraged to tap\
    \ \ninto the underutilized assets of smart cities to generate profits for their\
    \ inhabitants and \nstrengthen the economy. The technology can accelerate the\
    \ transition from the smart \ncity economy toward a sharing economy. In their\
    \ recent study, Rahman et al. (2019) \nstate that blockchain-based sharing economy\
    \ services can be effectuated by employing \nsmart contracts. The authors further\
    \ note that with the help of smart contracts, block-\nchain can automate location-aware\
    \ agreement logic and provide complex spatio-tempo-\nral services (e.g., insurance)\
    \ to a global level without the need for a central verification \nbody. Moreover,\
    \ the combination of smart contracts and Ethereum blockchain supports \nseveral\
    \ use cases in the smart city. For example, Salah et  al. (2019a; b) apply smart\
    \ \ncontracts and Ethereum blockchain for food traceability and tracking across\
    \ agricultural \nsupply chains. In the system, all transactions are kept in the\
    \ blockchain’s ledger and are \nconnected to a decentralized file system to maintain\
    \ the targeted level of traceability. In \nthe same vein, Toyoda et al. (2017)\
    \ leverage Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts \nto develop a traceability\
    \ system for the tracking of product information and for identi-\nfying forged\
    \ products. In the context of the automotive industry, Sharma et al. (2019) \n\
    develop an Ethereum blockchain-based distributed system to ensure on-demand services\
    \ \nfor customers in smart cities. With the aid of this blockchain, suppliers\
    \ and manufactur-\ners would be able to protect their products from counterfeits\
    \ and establish a sustainable \nautomotive ecosystem. Finally, Longo et al. (2019)\
    \ use an Ethereum blockchain to allow \nfirms to validate the integrity, invariability,\
    \ and authenticity of data exchanged by other \nfirms, thus precluding companies\
    \ from sharing inaccurate or unreliable data. Another \nopen-source blockchain\
    \ that allows the development of smart contracts is Hyperledger \nFabric. Using\
    \ the smart contract of Hyperledger Fabric, Hang and Kim (2020) use this \nfunctionality\
    \ of blockchain to simplify the task management of sensors and verify IoT \ndevices\
    \ and actuators at runtime. Jamil et al. (2019) present a solution to data integrity\
    \ \nmanagement based on Hyperledger Fabric to increase data security in a smart\
    \ hospi-\ntal. Sifah et  al. (2020) design a system for smart city governance\
    \ using Hyperledger \nFabric as the blockchain platform and operating scheme.\
    \ As per the study findings, \nthe proposed platform permits the simultaneous\
    \ tackling of several security issues like \ntrust, privacy, and accountability.\
    \ It also establishes a healthy smart city environment \namong government workers.\
    \ In the supply chain context, Wang et al. (2020) develop \na blockchain-based\
    \ Hyperledger Fabric to solve traceability and fragmentation issues \nand improve\
    \ information sharing among business stakeholders. Other use cases of \n 2888\n\
    A. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\nHyperledger Fabric include education, insurance process\
    \ improvement, and transpor-\ntation (Shen and Pena-Mora 2018). Compared to Ethereum\
    \ blockchains, Hyperledger \nFabric-based blockchains are more efficient and able\
    \ to maintain stable time consump-\ntion during smart city transactions (Chiu\
    \ and Meng 2021).\nBeyond Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, Bitcoin blockchain\
    \ also attracts signifi-\ncant attention from smart city researchers. This blockchain\
    \ is widely used for crypto-\ncurrency and not appropriate for general purpose\
    \ applications. Nevertheless, being the \ninitial and largest public blockchain,\
    \ Bitcoin provides a safe and strong payment system \nthat outperforms any other\
    \ blockchains. In general, Bitcoin blockchain is more suitable \nfor smart city\
    \ applications that need limited business logic and high security, such as \n\
    protection of government documents (Beris and Koubarakis 2018), e-voting (Noizat\
    \ \n2015), and machine-to-machine micropayment (Lundqvist et al. 2017).\n4.1.5\
    \  The development of smart community\nThe purple cluster contains the following\
    \ keywords; \"Smart Community\", \"EVs\" (Elec-\ntronic Vehicles), \"Contract\
    \ Theory\", and \"Energy\". The smart community represents an \nessential element\
    \ of the Internet of Energy (IoE), to which blockchain can contribute \nby securing\
    \ EV charging, optimizing the allocation of energy resources, and satisfy-\ning\
    \ EV’s individual energy consumption preferences (Su et al. 2019). Blockchain\
    \ has \nemerged to develop smart communities and optimize their consumption of\
    \ resources \n(Alcarria et al. 2018). Aggarwal et al. (2019) posit that blockchain\
    \ can be used to realize \nauthentication, authorization, security, confidentiality,\
    \ integrity, non-repudiation, and \naccountability for real-time smart city applications,\
    \ which may not be enabled by cen-\ntralized systems in a smart community context.\
    \ Blockchain is also a critical element for \nstrengthening transaction security\
    \ at charging stations of public electric vehicles. Thus, \nthe technology can\
    \ facilitate electricity trading between charging stations and electric \nvehicles\
    \ (Bhushan et  al. 2020). In Kang et  al. (2017), the authors suggest a consor-\n\
    tium blockchain for electricity trading among vehicles and for optimizing prices\
    \ and \nthe amount of electricity traded. Huang et  al. (2018) develop a trading\
    \ model based \non blockchain to store the transaction information between electric\
    \ vehicles and charg-\ning stations and to automate trading activities. Therefore,\
    \ blockchain contributes to the \ndevelopment of green transportation systems\
    \ by streamlining transparent and decentral-\nized trading processes between vehicles\
    \ and charging stations. Demand information of \nelectric vehicles (e.g., necessary\
    \ energy amounts, geographic region, time interval) and \ncharging stations (e.g.,\
    \ location, pricing) can be maintained by blockchain; therefore, \nelectric vehicles\
    \ can make more effective decisions, particularly concerning the selec-\ntion\
    \ of the optimal charging station. Furthermore, blockchain encourages P2P transac-\n\
    tions and ushers in new prosumer markets, where transactive energy systems are\
    \ the \npredominant paradigm. In such systems, utilities and smart homes in the\
    \ city move \nfrom passively consuming energy and receiving demand-response calls\
    \ to actively trad-\ning energy and ancillary services on blockchain and even\
    \ to developing locally efficient \nmarket clearing prices (Qi and Shen 2019).\
    \ The use of blockchain-based P2P energy \ntransaction is able to establish sustainable\
    \ energy ecosystem between prosumers, cus-\ntomers, and existing energy suppliers\
    \ (Shojaei et al. 2019). Finally, the keyword \"Smart \nHome\" is indicative of\
    \ blockchain’s potential to monitor its resources, ensure security \nand privacy,\
    \ and increase home automation (Li et al. 2019).\n2889\nBlockchain technology\
    \ in the smart city: a bibliometric review \n1 3\n4.1.6  Blockchain as a driver\
    \ for sustainable smart cities\nFinally, the last cluster consists of the following\
    \ keywords: “Sustainability”, “Big Data”, \n“ICT”, “Citizens”. Terms shown in\
    \ this cluster reveal the role of blockchain to incorporate \nsustainability in\
    \ the infrastructure of smart cities. In general, a smart city is orchestrated\
    \ to \nenable operational efficiencies, increase environmental sustainability\
    \ efforts, and improve \ncitizens’ quality of life. By utilizing blockchain in\
    \ smart mobility, there is a chance for \nless vehicles and road traffic, helping\
    \ to reduce air pollution and fossil fuel emissions \n(Wong et al. 2020). To further\
    \ strengthen the sustainability of urban mobility, Jaffe et al. \n(2017) propose\
    \ an incentive model that could be used by blockchain to prompt citizens in \n\
    cycling and to recompense commuting practices. The reward system also involves\
    \ citizens \nchoosing public transport or shared rides in the smart city. Due\
    \ to the increasing urbani-\nzation, it is crucial to devise effective waste management\
    \ policies to enforce the sustain-\nable dimension of smart cities. Related to\
    \ waste, the coupling of blockchain, IoT sensors \nand AI has the potential to\
    \ assist in waste management processes, including waste collec-\ntion, disposal,\
    \ and recycling. Through the implementation of blockchain, civil engineers \n\
    can benefit from reliable big data to improve urban resources and services (Berglund\
    \ et al. \n2020). In the bargain, smart cities can take advantage of blockchain\
    \ to advance economic, \nenvironmental, and social sustainability. In response,\
    \ this can support a country’s commit-\nment to meet sustainable development goals.\
    \ While the literature emphasizes that block-\nchain is ready to assimilate a\
    \ key role in the sustainable development of smart cities and \nenhance people’s\
    \ life conditions (Shen and Pena-Mora 2018), sustainability still represents \n\
    the furthest research topic from the mainstream of the analyses represented by\
    \ other clus-\nters. Consequently, there is a need for additional studies ascertaining\
    \ the sustainability out-\ncomes of blockchain in the smart city (Table 1). \n\
    4.2  Article co‑citation network\nAn article co-citation network represents an\
    \ essential type of co-citation analysis. The ori-\ngin of this method can be\
    \ traced to the work of Small (1973), who recommends the analy-\nsis of the network\
    \ of co-cited references. In this method, the units of the network analysis \n\
    are the articles, and co-citation clusters constitute the underlying intellectual\
    \ structures of \na particular field. Consistent with Chen et al. (2010), article\
    \ co-citation enables researchers \nto interpret the nature of the cited articles\
    \ in the cluster and the interlinks between the clus-\nters. The purpose of this\
    \ study was to conduct an article co-citation analysis to determine \nthe structure\
    \ of the most relevant contributions to the research area of blockchain and the\
    \ \nsmart city. Figure 6 presents the findings of the article co-citation network\
    \ extracted from \nVOSviewer. As shown, the highly co-cited pair of articles are\
    \ those connected with thick \narcs. A pair of co-cited articles occur when two\
    \ articles are cited together in a single arti-\ncle. The thick arcs indicate\
    \ a strong relationship between these articles and suggest simi-\nlarities regarding\
    \ specific topics within the field of blockchain and smart city (Batistič et al.\
    \ \n2017; Small 1973; Zupic and Čater 2015).\nOn the other hand, thin arcs signify\
    \ a weak co-citation association between co-cited arti-\ncles and the lack of\
    \ content similarities (Mishra et al. 2017, 2018). For example, the thick \narc\
    \ connecting Khan and Salah  (2018) and Hammi et al (2018) suggests that these\
    \ articles \nhave a strong co-citation relationship and share common ideas and/or\

    \ \n1 3\nIn contrast, the thin arc between Hammi et al. (2018) and Mistry (2020)\
    \ reflects a weak co-\ncitation strength, and thus the lack of content similarities\
    \ (Mishra et al. 2017, 2018).\nSetting a threshold of at least two citations per\
    \ article, only 58 nodes of the most co-\ncited articles are displayed in the\
    \ co-citation network in Fig. 6. The radius of a node gives \nan idea about its\
    \ total link strength which is the sum of link strengths of this node over all\
    \ \nthe other nodes. Moreover, four clusters were generated by VOSviewer. In terms\
    \ of the \ntotal number of nodes, the red cluster is the most significant one.\
    \ This cluster provides a \ngeneral overview of blockchain applications in the\
    \ smart city (Rahman et al., 2019; E. Xie \net al., 2006) and the role of the\
    \ technology in optimizing the efficiency and strengthening \nthe security and\
    \ privacy of various smart city applications such as IoT (Gong et al. 2019; \n\
    Shen et al. 2019; Viriyasitavat et al. 2019), IoV (Chen et al. 2020; Iqbal et al.\
    \ 2020; Yin \net al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2019), and big data (Yu et al. 2019). As\
    \ a result, researchers inter-\nested in understanding the potentialities and\
    \ challenges of blockchain for the smart city in \ngeneral, and the combination\
    \ of the technology with IoT and IoV in particular, may refer to \nthe articles\
    \ grouped in the red cluster. The green cluster groups all authors belonging to\
    \ the \nFig. 6  Article co-citation network\n 2892\nA. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\nsame\
    \ area of research and studying the potentials of blockchain for securing the\

    \ et al. 2018; Khan and \nSalah 2018; Makhdoom et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2018). Furthermore,\
    \ the blue cluster revolves \naround the potentials of blockchain solutions for\
    \ smart communities (Aggarwal et  al. \n2019), energy trading (Chaudhary et al.\
    \ 2019; Jindal et al. 2019), transportation (Astarita \net al. 2020; Mehta et al.\
    \ 2020; Sharma and Park 2018), artificial intelligence (Singh et al. \n2019, 2020a,\
    \ b), and construction (Sun and Zhang 2020). Lastly, the yellow cluster primar-\n\
    ily comprises all significant works associated with the application of blockchain\
    \ for smart \nenergy (Alcarria et al. 2018; Park et al. 2018; Pieroni et al. 2018;\
    \ Su et al. 2019; Wang \net al. 2019), smart tourism and entertainment (Liao and\
    \ Wang 2018; Nam et al. 2019), and \nsmart education (Fernandez-Carames and Fraga-Lamas\
    \ 2019). This cluster mostly groups \nall authors discussing the ability of blockchain\
    \ to secure energy transactions and create a \ntransparent system for energy supply\
    \ and trading.\nThe privacy-by-design nature of blockchain is well-suited for\
    \ smart city applications \nsuch as healthcare (Dagher et al. 2018; Dwivedi et al.\
    \ 2019), data sharing (Makhdoom \net al. 2020), and sharing economy services (Rahman\
    \ et al. 2019). Regardless of health-\ncare policies, blockchain could be implemented\
    \ in the smart city to authenticate and secure \nthe sharing of medical records\
    \ among the healthcare sector stakeholders. The storage of \nsensitive medical\
    \ data in blockchain can be helpful in situations of emergency, crisis, and \n\
    pandemics, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak. However, these application fields\
    \ have \nreceived less attention, especially from the empirical point of view.\n\
    From Fig. 6, it appears that the most pertinent and highly cited study is that\
    \ by Khan \nand Salah (2018), who conducted a review on IoT security, blockchain\
    \ solutions, and the \nchallenges faced by IoT technologies. Three articles with\
    \ more than 170 citations stand \nout for their number of citations (See Table 2).\
    \ The study of Khan and Salah (2018) has \nreceived the highest number of citations\
    \ and gained a significant level of academic atten-\ntion. The authors of this\
    \ study performed a comprehensive review of IoT and blockchain \ntechnologies.\
    \ Taken together, these technologies are expected to create several opportu-\n\
    nities for smart cities and introduce new challenges. The second study by Sharma\
    \ et al. \n(2017) received 189 citations. The authors proposed a vehicle network\
    \ architecture based \non blockchain in the smart city. Scholars recognize the\
    \ importance of the proposed sys-\ntem and the ability of blockchain to optimize\
    \ the use of infrastructure resources and cre-\nate intelligent transportation\
    \ systems. A study by Sun et al. (2016) received 172 citations. \nThis study developed\
    \ a conceptual framework and analyzed the benefits of blockchain for \nsupporting\
    \ communal sharing and renovating services in the smart city. Taking a closer\
    \ \nlook at all these articles, it is evident that blockchain holds the potential\
    \ to add value in \ndifferent smart city sectors and applications, including integration\
    \ with smart IoT technolo-\ngies, smart transportation, smart services, smart\
    \ healthcare, smart grids, and smart energy. \nOverall, since most influential\

    \ impact the way smart cities are \ndesigned and managed. The use cases of blockchain\
    \ in the smart city have become a \npriority topic for investigation by scholars,\
    \ practitioners, and governments worldwide. \nSeveral attempts were made to showcase\
    \ the promising capabilities of blockchain tech-\nnology for smart city applications.\
    \ To date, the proliferation of big data and the rapid \nevolution of IoT technologies\
    \ have helped to accelerate the development of smart cit-\nies. While these innovations\
    \ have played a critical role in reshaping different areas of \nhuman life, influencing\
    \ many sectors like healthcare, transportation, education, energy, \nand services,\
    \ they generate an array of challenges such as security threats (Ismail and \n\
    Materwala 2019; Khan and Salah 2018), privacy issues (Bernabe et  al. 2019), and\
    \ \ntechnical inefficiencies (Rathore et al. 2019).\n5.1.1  Blockchain for secure\
    \ smart city applications\nThe complexity underlying the administration and management\
    \ of a smart city through \nits infrastructure and systems creates a substantial\
    \ amount of sensitive data that neces-\nsitate a secure and large storage environment.\
    \ To mitigate cyber threats and ensure \nsafe data capture, data storage and data\
    \ access in smart cities, blockchain’s distributed \nledger, encryption, and immutability\
    \ features can provide a foundation layer for vari-\nous citizen and business\
    \ interaction applications with increased efficiency, improved \nsecurity, and\
    \ enhanced privacy. Features of blockchain such as enhanced reliability, \nunforgeability,\
    \ and fault tolerance, make the technology an effective tool for authenti-\ncation\
    \ problems (Khalid et al. 2020) and content integrity protection (Xie et al. 2019).\
    \ \nTherefore, the vision of the smart city can be achieved with the use of blockchain\
    \ (in \ncombination with other technologies) as the technology compliments a city’s\
    \ digital \ntransformation with enhanced security and privacy, both significant\
    \ pillars of smart \ncities (Ahad et al. 2020).\nFurthermore, the integration\
    \ of blockchain in smart cities can guarantee secure and \nreal-time data transmission\
    \ between smart city technologies (e.g., IoT, cyber-physical \nsystems, drones,\
    \ robotics) without the need for a central entity that manages and con-\ntrols\
    \ all the transmitted data. The security feature of blockchain helps facilitate\
    \ data \ntransfer (Dwivedi et al. 2019; Mehta et al. 2020), but also enables seamless\
    \ interac-\ntions between users of autonomous systems in a smart city environment.\
    \ For instance, \nthe combination of various devices applied in various smart\
    \ city applications (e.g., \nsmart transportation, smart healthcare, smart factory,\
    \ smart energy) can benefit from \nthe peer-to-peer network for authentication\
    \ and resilience against attacks. By taking \nadvantage of these merits, Singh\
    \ et al. (2019) argue that blockchain can support the \nconnection of artificial\
    \ intelligence (AI)-enabled data centres and allow decentralized \nand secure\
    \ big data analysis. Therefore, researchers of smart city applications that are\
    \ \nbased on data generated and collected by various technological components\
    \ have rec-\nognized the critical hardware and software security threats that\
    \ have arisen with the \ndeployment of new technologies. As per this review’s\
    \ findings, the nature of embed-\nded security and trust stresses the importance\
    \ of blockchain to enhance the integrity \nof smart city systems to overcome perceived\
    \ security risks. As a result, the use of \nblockchain to better manage the risks\
    \ related to system security may increase citizens’ \nacceptance and usage of\
    \ information technology-enabled services and maximize the \neffectiveness of\
    \ the smart city initiative.\n2895\nBlockchain technology in the smart city: a bibliometric\
    \ review \n1 3\n5.1.2  Blockchain for private smart city transactions\nBesides\
    \ robust security, blockchain technology provides privacy measures for the massive\
    \ \namounts of data generated in the smart city, including weather, energy, healthcare,\
    \ manu-\nfacturing, and services data. New technologies can pose significant privacy\
    \ concerns with-\nout reasonable privacy measures due to the massive aggregation\
    \ of location-based informa-\ntion and their transfer over smart city networks.\
    \ However, with the support of blockchain, \nit is possible to tackle the complexity\
    \ and privacy issues of using distributed databases \n(Ismail and Materwala 2019).\
    \ Blockchain provides a practical scheme, which preserves \ndata privacy and ensures\
    \ authorized access to different data types, including health, smart \ncars, smart\
    \ energy, and financial details (Makhdoom et al. 2020). Privacy applications of\
    \ \nblockchain can prevent breaches, protect personal data (Astarita et al. 2020),\
    \ and embed \nprivacy in products and services (Oliveira et al. 2020). According\
    \ to several studies, block-\nchain acts as an innovative and effective safeguard\
    \ to the privacy of transactions due to its \nauthentication and encryption mechanisms\
    \ (Altulyan et al. 2020; Chaudhary et al. 2019; \nKhan et al. 2020; Nam et al.\
    \ 2019; Treiblmaier et al. 2020). With fewer worries about \ntheir privacy, citizens\
    \ can rely on blockchain-enabled applications to protect their personal \ninformation.\n\
    5.1.3  Blockchain for smart city sustainability\nThe integration of blockchain\
    \ technology can transform every sector of the smart city. \nSuch transformation\
    \ can bring several smart city improvements in more resilient informa-\ntion systems,\
    \ proper governance models, sustainable use of resources, intelligent manage-\n\
    ment and allocation of natural resources and city facilities, and enhanced quality\
    \ of life. \nThe improvement of sustainability has always been one of the desired\
    \ targets in the smart \ncity. By integrating sustainability with blockchain technology,\
    \ the smart city can drive sus-\ntainable development and growth from an economic,\
    \ social, and environmental perspec-\ntive. For example, the challenges associated\
    \ with energy consumption can be addressed by \nblockchain. The technology can\
    \ be used as a foundation to develop a peer-to-peer (P2P) \nenergy-transaction\
    \ platform to connect energy resources and home appliances and provide \nlow-cost\
    \ energy at all times and locations (Park et al. 2018). The inclusion of sustaina-\n\
    bility aspects in a smart city also involves adopting blockchain for smart waste\
    \ manage-\nment, the reduction of environmental impacts (Berglund et al. 2020),\
    \ and the preservation \nof ecosystem resiliency (Hammi et al. 2018). Blockchain\
    \ is expected to support the smart \ncity paradigm, foster green strategies, and\
    \ enhance urban sustainability. Smart cities can \nbenefit from the emergence\
    \ of blockchain to increase efficiencies and reduce the strain on \nscarce resources.\
    \ Consequently, blockchain implementation enables system designers to \ncreate\
    \ a sustainable smart city, which is the engine of economic efficiency, growth,\
    \ and \nsocial inclusiveness (Berglund et al. 2020). This study shows that blockchain\
    \ can hasten \nmoves towards a more sustainable smart city, in which the wise\
    \ management of resources \nis aligned with social inclusion and urban liveability.\n\
    5.1.4  The fusion of blockchain and IoT in the smart city\nThe combination of\
    \ blockchain and IoT provides more robust and secure platforms for \nsmart sensors\
    \ and devices to interact seamlessly within the smart city environment. Also,\
    \ \n 2896\nA. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\nblockchain technology contributes to developing\
    \ ‘security-by-design’ and intelligent IoT \nsystems that can be used in smart\
    \ grids, smart homes, smart transportation, smart energy, \nand smart healthcare.\
    \ The phenomenal proliferation of IoT has enabled ubiquitous con-\nnectivity and\
    \ intelligent automation, contributing to the development of smart cities. To\
    \ \nadvance IoT-enabled smart cities, blockchain can play a critical role in improving\
    \ IoT net-\nworks, achieving fault tolerance, optimizing resource consumption,\
    \ and enhancing data \nprocessing performance (Liu et al. 2020). The combination\
    \ of blockchain and IoT is an \nenabler for transparency (Mistry et al. 2020),\
    \ seamless data integration (Viriyasitavat et al. \n2019), and increased security\
    \ (Rathore et al. 2018). Empowered by blockchain technol-\nogy, IoT can enable\
    \ trust-free transactions, automation, and secure machine-to-machine \ncommunications\
    \ between IoT devices. This paper, therefore, argues that in a smart city, \n\
    blockchain can respond to several needs for the secure interconnection between\
    \ devices \nand citizens, efficient sharing of information, resources, and services.\
    \ The application of \nblockchain technology for the smart city can create reliable\
    \ storage of big data, resulting in \nbetter smart city services. Using blockchain\
    \ data, decision-makers would have the opportu-\nnity to effectively plan for\
    \ enhancing smart city services, expanding resources, and making \ninformed decisions.\n\
    5.1.5  The challenges of blockchain in the smart city\nIn advancing the discussion\
    \ further, a relevant follow-up question we asked is \"What are \nthe challenges\
    \ of adopting blockchain in the smart city?\" Despite the enablers of block-\n\
    chain for smart cities, as evidenced in the reviewed literature, the relative\
    \ immaturity and \nlack of wide-scale implementations of the technology constitute\
    \ one of the significant sys-\ntems-related barriers (Astarita et al. 2020). This\
    \ technological immaturity may increase the \nrisk and uncertainty level of citizens,\
    \ smart city designers, and decision-makers, thereby \nreducing or delaying the\
    \ adoption of blockchain. However, the technology’s infancy does \nnot constitute\
    \ a problematic issue since blockchain applications are expected to mature \n\
    with time.\nAnother pressing challenge of blockchain deployments in the smart\
    \ city is the limited \nscalability of blockchain systems (Liu et al. 2020). For\
    \ instance, the early generations of \nblockchain implementations are notoriously\
    \ characterized by low scalability (Scekic et al. \n2019). Ismail and Materwala\
    \ (2019) argue that the low scalability of blockchain is essen-\ntially caused\
    \ by data redundancies and increasing computational and communication over-\n\
    heads. From the perspective of storage, throughput, and networking, the existing\
    \ block-\nchain designs still suffer from scalability issues. Thus, more decentralized,\
    \ energy-efficient, \nhigh transaction throughput, and highly scalable blockchain\
    \ consensus algorithms are \nrequired. The realization of these needs and the\
    \ development of scalable blockchains will \nhelp overcome the misalignment between\
    \ the existing protocols and the customer services \nand meet the requirements\
    \ of large-scale collaborative ecosystems in the smart city (Ismail \nand Materwala\
    \ 2019). Therefore, studies proposing practical solutions for blockchain scal-\n\
    ability in the smart city are welcome, considering security, reliability, and\
    \ fine-grained \ndecentralized access control (Mistry et al. 2020).\nAnother challenge\
    \ of blockchain implementations in the smart city refers to the lack \nof standards\
    \ and acceptance at the official level. So far, there are no technology standards\
    \ \nthat help blockchain integration with other technologies such as the IoT and\
    \ 5G networks \n(Mehta et al. 2020; Mistry et al. 2020). Ahmed et al. (2020) note\
    \ that current IoT frame-\nworks rely on unified or expedited standards with enormous\
    \ computational and capacity \n2897\nBlockchain technology in the smart city:\
    \ a bibliometric review \n1 3\nlimits. Given that the communication between devices\
    \ and nodes with multiple software \ninterfaces necessitates a shared platform\
    \ and protocol to facilitate data transfer, it is urgent \nto establish standards\
    \ and protocols globally in the smart city (Tiwari and Batra 2021). \nAs a result,\
    \ the adoption of blockchain in smart cities requires proper governance, poli-\n\
    cies, rules, and guidelines for the effective deployment of the technology. Without\
    \ stand-\nards and regulations, the smart city’s systems would not be able to\
    \ interoperate, making it \nimpossible to share information across platforms.\
    \ Likewise, the development of efficient \nand collaborative smart city applications\
    \ will become a complicated task, and undesirable \nconsequences (e.g., data inconsistencies\
    \ and fragmentation, software management issues, \noperational inefficiencies)\
    \ may arise when dealing with configured devices (Mistry et al. \n2020).\n5.2\
    \  Research implications\n5.2.1  Theoretical implications, limitations and future\
    \ research directions\nIn this study, we conducted a systematic bibliometric review\
    \ to generate some relevant \ninsights on blockchain research in the smart city\
    \ context. Nonetheless, our bibliometric \nanalyses have several limitations:\n\
    • The review results are based on a short period of the publications involved\
    \ (2016–2020) \nand are restricted to specific subject areas. Although the list\
    \ is comprehensive and cov-\ners leading academic journals with highly cited and\
    \ co-cited articles, the collection of \nstudies is not exhaustive. Several research\
    \ studies are expected to be conducted in the \nforeseeable future as blockchain\
    \ technology has gained worldwide traction.\n• We only conducted one method of\
    \ co-citation analysis, namely, article co-citation \nanalysis. Many different\
    \ methods exist to perform co-citation analyses, such as biblio-\ngraphic coupling,\
    \ author co-citation analysis, and co-authorship analysis.\n• The results of the\
    \ review were determined by the keywords used for the search and col-\nlection\
    \ of studies. Although we are confident that we surveyed an extensive knowledge\
    \ \nbase, there might be articles that are potentially relevant to the scope of\
    \ the study but \nnot captured.\n• We have only selected journal articles, ignoring\
    \ other vital sources of knowledge such \nas conference proceedings, books, and\
    \ book chapters. Though the selected articles pro-\nvide valuable insights for\
    \ academics and practitioners, non-journal articles may offer \ninteresting insights\
    \ that are not covered in our reviewed literature.\n• An important step in conducting\
    \ a bibliometric study is the preparation of data. Even \nthough numerous databases\
    \ and electronically accessible sources can be used in biblio-\nmetric studies,\
    \ most technology-oriented analyses choose only one database as a source \n(Suominen\
    \ and Seppänen 2014) because the bibliometric software (i.e., VOSviewer) \nis\
    \ only able to read data from one database and cannot merge data from multiple\
    \ data-\nbases (Yeung et al. 2019). Therefore, future researchers are encouraged\
    \ to use the Web \nof Science database in their bibliometric studies, which may\
    \ imply different clustering \nresults and novel insights.\nThis study applied\
    \ bibliometric techniques, including keyword co-occurrence net-\nwork analysis\
    \ and article co-citation analysis, to investigate the core content of block-\n\
    chain research in the context of smart cities and identify the intellectual structure\
    \ of this \n 2898\nA. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\nnascent literature. The overall analysis\

    \ reveals that blockchain technology has attracted increasing atten-\ntion from\
    \ scholars who are active in the smart city research domain. Blockchain technol-\n\
    ogy is expected to penetrate the foundations layers of smart cities and pave the\
    \ way for \nmore innovative, secure, and smarter applications. The use of blockchain\
    \ is not without \nits challenges, given the embryonic nature of the technology\
    \ and its technical limitations. \nHowever, we believe that blockchain in the\
    \ smart city presents a unique opportunity for \nresearchers to examine the applicability\
    \ of the technology in different smart city sectors \nand propose workable solutions\
    \ that contribute to the wide-scale implementation of the \ntechnology. This review\
    \ might inspire researchers to study further the integration of block-\nchain,\
    \ big data, and the IoT.\nMoreover, from a theoretical perspective, several theoretical\
    \ lenses can be applied to \nsmart cities. Social exchange theory (SET) is one\
    \ of the oldest theories on social behaviour \nand interactions of individual\
    \ and the exchange of tangible and intangible resources. It may \ninform researchers\
    \ on the evolution of human behaviours and their technology-enabled \ninteractions\
    \ in smart cities. Further, researchers could apply a transaction cost economics\
    \ \n(TCE) lens to analyse the potential efficiencies created by using blockchain\
    \ and other tech-\nnologies to enable smart cities.\nFinally, we argue that blockchain\
    \ has the potential to offer fruitful avenues in the field \nof smart city and\
    \ urban research. We submit that the characteristics of the technology are \n\
    encouraging and open windows for future research. The researchers may be interested\
    \ in \nexploring the following knowledge gaps:\n• Blockchain technology can redefine\
    \ the economic, social, and environmental dimen-\nsions of sustainability in the\
    \ smart city environment.\n• Blockchain technology combined with IoT and big data\
    \ supports the vision for smart \ncities.\n• Blockchain technology can help mitigate\
    \ the problems caused by urban population \ngrowth by improving the competitive\
    \ profile of the city.\n• Blockchain technology can be a valuable solution to\
    \ promote participatory govern-\nance, fuel sustainable economic growth, and enable\
    \ effective management of natural \nresources.\n• Blockchain technology can create\
    \ effective sharing economy models in the smart city \nand optimize efficiencies\
    \ in meeting the demands for city services.\n• Blockchains can be used for simultaneous\
    \ assurance of confidentiality, integrity/non-\nrepudiation, and accessibility\
    \ of content.\n• Blockchain technology can drive significant operational efficiencies\
    \ and free up finan-\ncial resources in smart cities.\n• Blockchain technology\
    \ can automate and streamline public sector procurement and \nreduce the risk\
    \ of fraud in supply contracts.\n5.2.2  Managerial implications\nWe underline\
    \ the importance for smart city designers and practitioners operating in the \n\
    urban sector to be updated with blockchain technology and the different solutions\
    \ and \napplications that could be employed to achieve sustainable smart cities.\
    \ Smart city design-\ners are recommended to focus on technical features of blockchain\
    \ while responding to citi-\nzens’ concerns in terms of privacy, security, and\
    \ access control. Capitalizing on blockchain \n2899\nBlockchain technology in the smart\
    \ city: a bibliometric review \n1 3\ntechnology can accelerate the smart city\
    \ movement, ensure the proper functioning of cities, \nand meet the current and\
    \ emerging needs of citizens. Nations that are striving to make their \ncities\
    \ smarter might find blockchain capable of unleashing the innovative and competitive\
    \ \npotential of the city.\nMoreover, we stress the importance of best practices\
    \ and critical success factors in \ndeploying effective policies and strategies\
    \ to spread blockchain initiatives in smart cities. It \nis also imperative that\
    \ programmers, network developers, and smart city designers engage \nin an ongoing\
    \ discussion to understand blockchain’s finer points and anticipate and remove\
    \ \nloopholes that would unavoidably emerge. For governments challenged by the\
    \ complexi-\nties of transforming smart city initiatives into practice, they can\
    \ apply blockchain for cus-\ntomized smart city solutions, including transportation,\
    \ energy management, and city sur-\nveillance, to satisfy local needs and meet\
    \ development agendas. Hence, policymakers are \nadvised to rethink the role of\
    \ technology to foster the economic, environmental, and social \nstrategies and\
    \ substructures for the practical realization of sustainable smart cities.\n6\
    \  Conclusions\nThe rapid growth of global population along with an increasing\
    \ urbanization process have \nplaced pressure on the economic, environmental,\
    \ and social sustainability of cities. As a \nresult, the smart city paradigm\
    \ is suggested to leverage modern technologies in a smart \nfashion so as to construct\
    \ a livable urban environment and enhance the quality of citi-\nzens’ lives. Nevertheless,\
    \ smart cities are still endangered by a wide array of security and \nprivacy\
    \ threats. With the emergence of the blockchain, these proliferating issues can\
    \ be \neffectively overcome thanks to the intrinsic properties of the technology,\
    \ including immu-\ntability, transparency, auditability, and decentralization.\
    \ By integrating blockchains, cities \nare expected to become able to realize\
    \ sustainable targets because the technology can sup-\nport several smart city\
    \ sectors such as healthcare, transportation, logistics and supply chain \nmanagement,\
    \ and public administration. While weak citizen involvement, poor governance,\
    \ \nand threats of system failure are the main concerns hampering the development\
    \ of sustain-\nable smart cities (Aghimien et al. 2020), digitalization of administration,\
    \ citizenship, smart \ncity activities through blockchain can bring several advantages\
    \ in terms of system transpar-\nency, security, resilience. Moreover, the alignment\
    \ of blockchain with sustainability goals \ncan help cities encounter the degradation\
    \ of infrastructure and resources by supporting the \ndevelopment of smart applications\
    \ that alleviate traffic congestion, reduce global warming, \nand cater to the\
    \ needs of the citizens.\nDrawing on bibliometric tools and techniques, we conducted\
    \ an extensive review of lit-\nerature on blockchain and the smart city over 2016\
    \ and 2020. We generated interesting \ninsights into the evolutionary patterns\
    \ of blockchain-smart city research, the major con-\ntributing countries, and\
    \ the scientific journals taking part in advancing this emerging field. \nThrough\
    \ the keyword co-occurrence and article co-citation networks, we identified the\
    \ \ncore content of the retrieved literature and the influential studies contributing\
    \ to the con-\nceptual development of the field. For instance, the fusion of blockchain\
    \ and IoT is shown \nto boost security in accessing the data collected by sensors\
    \ and preserving data integrity \nfor IoT-enabled smart city systems. Blockchain\
    \ also provides privacy for the implementa-\ntion of machine learning algorithms\
    \ in the smart city. To gain significant insights from \nIoT devices, machine\
    \ learning can be utilized during data analysis, and its outcomes can \nbe maintained\
    \ in blockchain for secure storage and sharing. Benefitting from the technical\
    \ \n 2900\nA. Rejeb et al.\n1 3\ncharacteristics of blockchain, smart contracts\
    \ can be applied in numerous trading applica-\ntions due to their automation,\
    \ which offers transparent and reliable data sharing among \nservice providers\
    \ and network participants. Finally, blockchain is found to empower smart \ncommunities\
    \ and foster sustainability in smart cities.\nTo our best knowledge, this is the\
    \ first study attempting to conduct a bibliometric review \non blockchain and\
    \ the smart city, unravel the content of this research field, and classify \n\
    co-cited works. Even though these tools have been applied in other fields, there\
    \ is a lack \nof knowledge regarding the investigation of blockchain applications\
    \ in the smart city using \nbibliometrics. Therefore, we believe that the current\
    \ research has been unique, offering sig-\nnificant contributions to theory by\
    \ proposing fertile research areas. We did not cover all the \npotential applications\
    \ of blockchain, as we were concerned only with their impact on the \nsmart city\
    \ sectors. We hope the trajectory of the research described herein provides food\
    \ \nfor thought and encouragement for scholars to investigate further the intricacies\
    \ of adopt-\ning blockchain in smart cities and urban developments.\nAppendix\n\

    Abstract\nAccording to the United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals are framed\
    \ for improving rural health, hunger, poverty \nissues, environmental conditions,\
    \ and illiteracy globally. With the upcoming technology, there have been many\
    \ advances \nin the lifestyle of people all around the world. Comparatively, more\
    \ emphasis has been given to the development of urban \nareas than rural. The\
    \ sustainable development of a country depends on the growth of its rural areas.\
    \ Countless technologi-\ncal and theoretical models, projects, and frameworks\
    \ have been proposed and implemented to help overcome sundry issues \nand challenges\
    \ faced by rural people in quotidian life. New technological methods are deemed\
    \ to be the future of livability, \ntherefore; a technologically advanced solution\
    \ for sustainable rural development is called for. Blockchain Technology is the\
    \ \nnext step for innovation and development and it has far many applications\
    \ in sustainable rural development that are yet to \nbe discovered. The objective\
    \ of this paper is to explicitly review research conducted in rural development\
    \ to fill the undone \nwork in the future with better research ideas, to make\
    \ rural areas a livable and advanced place while also maintaining their \nintegrity\
    \ leading to sustainable development. To conduct such a review, a systematic research\
    \ methodology is applied follow-\ning regulations in the conduction of standardized\
    \ but explorative analysis. Within the timeline of 2010–2021, 112 papers are \n\
    carefully selected to perform the systematic review. This review will provide\
    \ a comprehensible as well as concise research \ncompendium for all applications\
    \ proposed, implemented, and possible in the future to realize the concept of\
    \ smart villages \nfor the development of rural areas using blockchain technology.\n\

    \ of a country partly depends on how well \nconnected are its rural areas to the\
    \ global chain and how \ntechnologically advanced they are. Rural areas as we\
    \ know \nof are geographical locations sited outside town or cities \nwith fewer\
    \ populations. Essentially, we also know it as a \nplace unprivileged of vital\
    \ necessities, stricken by poverty \n[1], and unemployment. For many years, rural\
    \ areas have \nbeen developing consecutively in Technology, Education, \nHousing,\
    \ Governance, Human rights. Accordingly, the \nworld’s rural population has dropped\
    \ from 66.389 percent \nin 1960–44.286 [2] percent in 2019 due to various trans-\n\
    formations. Years ago, people in rural areas were deprived \nof necessities such\
    \ as water, electricity, and education. \nEven getting a reliable source of electricity\
    \ was a strenuous \neffort. Moreover, female rights, reliable healthcare and sub-\n\
    sequently securing a job were more of a dream. According \nto the United Nations,\
    \ there can be seen a steady drop in \nthe percentage of people residing in rural\
    \ areas from 1960 \nto 2019 [3]. What was the core reason behind it? A general\
    \ \nexample of the reason can be migration, rural decline, demo-\ngraphic qualities,\
    \ natural disasters, and infrastructure: trans-\nportation or socio-economic.\
    \ These can further be exploited \ninto many explanations as to what leads to\
    \ those choices. \nRural–Urban migration itself directs catastrophic changes \n\
    in the environment and economy. Rural Decline is another \nconsequence of migration\
    \ that drains the area of services, \nbusinesses, and social capital forcing the\
    \ development of the \nFig. 1  Issues in rural areas\n2419\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ or probably diminish [4]. Even then, almost \nhalf of the world’s population\
    \ comes under rural areas and it \nconsists of many more issues than resolvable.\n\
    1.1  Background\nThis section explores the interdependent backdrops of the \n\
    rural area and a feasible solution through the concept of \nsmart villages. Sustainable\
    \ development goals with respect \nto Blockchain Technology are discussed in sub-Sect. 1.1.2\
    \ \nand a brief introduction on Blockchain Technology and \ndevelopment techniques\
    \ are mentioned in sub-Sect. 1.1.3.\n1.1.1  Rural Development\nSustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs) were framed for \nimproving rural health, hunger, poverty issues,\
    \ environ-\nmental conditions, and illiteracy globally. The present situ-\nation\
    \ of rural areas brings us to a list of issues (Fig. 1) that \ncan further promote\
    \ the eradication of rural areas from the \nglobal chain if not technologically.\
    \ Beginning with pov-\nerty which has been an issue unresolved regardless of the\
    \ \nvarious monetary schemes provided by the government \ndrives the young generation\
    \ out of the community to find \njobs to sustain daily needs. Many of them fail\
    \ to finish \neven high school, which leads to securing menial jobs in \nurban\
    \ regions. This brings us to the second issue in the \nrural community, illiteracy\
    \ [5]. Education that plays a vital \nrole in the overall development of humans,\
    \ as well as the \ncommunity, is often disregarded to fulfill contemporary \n\
    requirements such as money. In many cases, the parents \nexploit their children\
    \ into working on the farm or small \nfamily businesses.\nTypical issues in a\
    \ rural school can be enumerated as \nteacher’s absenteeism, unhygienic school\
    \ premises, and dis-\ntant schools, technologically backward, absence of school\
    \ \nrecords, inexperienced teachers, and teachers with false \ndegrees. Those\
    \ who get themselves educated, consider it \nbetter to get a job in urban areas\
    \ because of job opportunities \nand better pay which is at times difficult since\
    \ most villages \nlack communication between employees and job availability \n\
    [6]. Basic hygiene and pollution are other issues in rural \nareas that deplete\
    \ life expectancy and give birth to numer-\nous diseases. Many rural communities\
    \ do not have proper \nsanitation facilities, dumping grounds, or recycling plants.\
    \ \nNot having the basic facilities drives people into a lack of \npersonal hygiene\
    \ such as bathing, washing, and cleanliness \n[7]. Pollution of land and soil\
    \ is prevalent due to unhealthy \nsanitary practices. Hundreds of people still\
    \ live without \nwashing their hands leading to diarrhea, cholera, and the \n\
    death of children [8]. Acknowledging the fact that medical \npractitioners, physicians\
    \ are scarce on top of that reaching \na nearby multispecialty hospital takes\
    \ a lot of time [9]. The \nprimary activity of rural people is said to be agriculture.\
    \ \nIt is considered to be the basic source of income for the \ndwellers. Farmers\
    \ in many areas remain uninformed about \nthe recent advancements in agro-technologies.\
    \ The core \nreason for this incomprehension is the lack of broadband \nconnection\
    \ and incentives. Even though the Government \nprovides various monetary as well\
    \ as agricultural schemes, \nmore than half of the farmers fail to enroll in one\
    \ [10]. In \naddition to that from the consumer’s point, there is a whole \nheap\
    \ of issues relating to the certification of quality produce, \nimproper monitoring\
    \ of crops, traceability of farm produce, \nand unsustainable agro-activities.\
    \ Besides, the involvement \nof middlemen leaves the farmers with the minimal\
    \ price \nof agricultural produce [11]. Further, given the aspects of \ndaily\
    \ needs, approximately 940 million [12] people around \nthe world live without\
    \ access to electricity, most of which \nbelong to rural areas. In a generation\
    \ where electricity is \nthe basic need in every household, industry, medical\
    \ center \nwithout which the whole institution of Earth would come \nto a halt,\
    \ there are still people who do their daily activi-\nties without it [8, 9]. About\
    \ 1.7 billion [13] people in the \nworld are still unbanked. The banking facility\
    \ is essential \nfor financial assistance especially much needed to financially\
    \ \nexcluded dwellers of the rural community. However, due \nto unreachable banking\
    \ locations, time-consuming Banking \nprocesses, and in many cases lacking identity\
    \ proof con-\nstrains the adults from applying for a bank account further \nreducing\
    \ the chances of obtaining a loan or funding from \ngovernment schemes [14].\n\
    The concept of a smart village [15] is to develop a rural \narea using technology\
    \ as a medium. The biggest problems \nin rural areas are financial exclusion,\
    \ poverty, hygiene, and \neducation [16]. All the issues are interconnected and\
    \ co-\ndependent, such as due to poverty, children in rural areas fail \nto get\
    \ an education [17]. Due to illiteracy, the villagers do \nnot come to know about\
    \ various financial schemes. People \nseem to care very less about hygiene. Not\
    \ only the waste \nis disposed of incorrectly, but it is also burnt giving rise\
    \ to \nenvironmental pollution. Most of the time people do not \nfind encouragement\
    \ to learn how to properly discard waste \nmaterial, to get educated, or find\
    \ a solution to their financial \nproblems [18].\n1.1.2  Sustainable Development\
    \ and Blockchain\nThe development of an economically backward area without \n\
    jeopardizing the natural assets or future necessities is termed \nsustainable\
    \ development. According to the United Nations, \nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDG) [19] were adopted \nin 2015 for improving rural health, hunger, poverty\
    \ issues, \nenvironmental conditions, and illiteracy globally (Fig. 2). \nThe\
    \ sustainable development goals that balance the socio-\neconomic and environmental\
    \ factors are:\n2420\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nFor rural development, World\
    \ Bank has provided pro-\ngrams in public administration, agricultural markets,\
    \ \ncommercialization, and agriculture business, agricultural \nextension, research,\
    \ and many other support activities \nalong with social protection and transportation\
    \ programs \nfor rural communities [2]. IFAD projects for eliminating \npoverty\

    \ in East Africa, Climate Risk Analysis in East \nand Southern Africa, Climate\
    \ finance gap examination for \nsmall-scale agriculture, etcetera [20]. The IEEE\
    \ smart vil-\nlage is an approach to empowering underserved communi-\nties, providing\
    \ the power, education, entrepreneur oppor-\ntunities. Following are the project\
    \ initiatives by IEEE \nSmart Village Initiative: Mural Net(MNAZ)- Broadband \n\

    \ consumers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, \nIndia [21].\nChallenges of achieving Sustainable\
    \ Development Goals \n(SG’s) in rural areas can be elucidated in terms of different\
    \ \nregions. As per the research [22], in Ukraine, control over \nthe large businesses\
    \ and their impact over the agribusiness \nstructures in addition to shrinking\
    \ the number of farms, \njeopardizing rural population, poverty, and fewer efforts\
    \ in \nsocial cohesion improvements or remote development are \nthe principal\
    \ challenges of achieving SDG.\nSimilarly, as per the methodology applied by the\
    \ author in \n[23], the major challenges faced by Romania over achieving \nSDG\
    \ are the Socio economic discrepancy among the rural \ndwellers’ lives as well\
    \ as the Environmental incongruity.\nA few of the Sustainable Development challenges\
    \ faced \nby the Iranian Rural communities as per the authors [24] \nare economic\
    \ setbacks, improper management, and under-\nplanned developments, environmental\
    \ factors, social con-\ncerns, and infrastructural challenges were determined.\
    \ \nOverall implications of the studies provide us with a con-\ncise picture of\
    \ significant challenges of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment goals in rural\
    \ areas.\nSustainability and blockchain both are the call for the \nfuture to\
    \ reduce cost, increase productivity, improving \nhealth, better environmental\
    \ state, and availability of food, \nwater, and sanitation. Blockchain holds the\
    \ ability for long-\nterm and inclusive progress in sustainable development and\
    \ \nto achieve SDGs.\n1.1.3  Blockchain Technology\nIn 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto\
    \ [25] (pseudonym) proposed \nBitcoin, its expansion was doubted. The rise of\
    \ Blockchain \nwas such unforeseen that some enthusiasts asserted it as the \n\
    biggest invention since the Internet [26]. Although W Scott \nStornetta and Stuart\
    \ Haber described the first cryptographi-\ncally secured chain of blocks in 1991,\
    \ it wasn’t until 2009 \nthat Blockchain was implemented as the public ledger\
    \ for \nbitcoin transactions by Nakamoto. For a substantial amount \nof time,\
    \ Blockchain technology was only preferred for a \ncryptocurrency (Fig. 3). However,\
    \ after the introduction of \nscripting language into the blocks by Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ \nto work as bonds, which are now known as Smart Contracts \nthe inventory of\
    \ applications widely opened. In his paper \nNakamoto proposed to create a peer-to-peer\
    \ form of elec-\ntronic cash that did not require a financial institution as an\
    \ \nintermediary and would be transferred directly between \none party and another.\
    \ He improved the double-spending \nFig. 2  Sustainable development \ngoals\n\

    \ \n1 3\nproblem in Digital Signatures by implementing timestamps \non the transaction\
    \ and hashing them onto the ongoing chain \nof hash-based proof-of-work which\
    \ changed the proof-of-\nwork if tampered with hence forming an immutable record.\n\
    Blockchain, even though it uses pseudonyms as account \nidentifiers, has four\
    \ key trust characteristics that eliminate \nthe need for third-party authenticators.\
    \ Firstly, a ledger in \nwhich after successful verification and authentication\
    \ the \ntransaction details are stored. Secondly, it is Secure since \nits transactions\
    \ are time-stamped and hashed to the previ-\nous blocks; it makes the blockchain\
    \ cryptographically secure \n(Fig. 4). Thirdly, the shared characteristic of involving\
    \ mul-\ntiple users provides transparency amongst all participants \nin the distributed\
    \ ledger. Lastly, its property of being dis-\ntributed eliminates operational\
    \ inefficiencies, provides more \nsecurity as the more the number of nodes the\
    \ more resilient \nit is towards attacks [27].\nThe complexity of the working\
    \ of blockchain can be \nsimplified by exploring the components that make up its\
    \ \narchitecture [28]. The main components can be enumer-\nated as Node, Cryptographic\
    \ hash functions, Transactions, \nAsymmetric-key cryptography, Ledgers, Blocks,\
    \ Miners, \nand Consensus (Fig. 5).\nNode: A device possibly a computer forming\
    \ the structure \nof a blockchain. A node is where the blockchain exists. Cop-\n\
    ies, as well as original records of the blockchain, are stored \nin a node. Classified\
    \ as Full node and Light nodes, where \nFull node is a server in a decentralized\
    \ network that contains \nthe Block chain’s block history, and Light nodes are\
    \ used for \nsimple payment verification such as a wallet that queries the \n\
    current status of a block.\nLedgers: A decentralized blockchain uses a ledger\
    \ for \nrecord-keeping. As it is decentralized, it keeps many copies \nof the\
    \ transaction including providing a copy to each user \nof their transaction.\n\
    Blocks: A block resembles a page in a record book \n(ledger). The first block\
    \ is called the generic block. A block \ncomprises a block header and block data\
    \ where the block \nheader consists of the history of the blockchain (previous\
    \ \nhash value, timestamp, size of the block, and nonce) and \nminers perform\
    \ hashing to validate the block, and block data \nkeeps the record of recent transactions\
    \ that are yet to enter \nthe blocks.\nCryptographic hash functions: A digest\
    \ or an algorithm \nthat takes up an arbitrary amount of data and produces a \n\
    hash value or hash which is an output of fixed size. It elimi-\nnates the use\
    \ of a password, instead uses enciphered text that \nprovides more security from\
    \ attackers.\nTransactions: A transaction is what the components work \nabout.\
    \ When two parties interact in blockchain, a transaction \ntakes place. Authorization\
    \ is required to approve a transac-\ntion between two parties. In a public blockchain,\
    \ the trans-\naction is inserted by consensus which happens when the \nmajority\
    \ of nodes validate the transaction.\nAsymmetric-key cryptography: It is public-key\
    \ cryptogra-\nphy that is used to enable certitude between the transacting \n\
    parties who are unsure about each other’s integrity. Asym-\nmetric-key cryptography\
    \ uses mathematically related keys to \nensure safety as well as the secrecy of\
    \ data. The public key \nand Private key, even though relative is used for decryption\
    \ \nand encryption, respectively.\nMiners: When two users create a transaction,\
    \ the miners \nvalidate that transaction in the block data before putting it \n\
    on the ledger. The average time it takes for a miner to mine a \nblock is 10 min.\
    \ Since miners use their energy and hardware \nto solve a block, they also require\
    \ an incentive for their work \nwhich is mostly paid in cryptocurrency.\nConsensus:\
    \ A consensus can be identified as a decision-\nmaking criterion. It makes sure\
    \ that all the nodes validate a \nblock and no such duplicity exists in the ledger\
    \ that hasn’t \nbeen agreed upon. The discussion involved in consensus is \nFig.\

    1 3\nused to solve identity-issue, clarify altercations, and estab-\nlish a similar\
    \ viewpoint between the participants by applying \na set of rules.\nEthereum:\
    \ introduced by Vitalik Buterin [29] addressed \nvarious limitations of the scripting\
    \ language in the block-\nchain. The platform is used to build and publish distributed\
    \ \napplications by using a programming language. It is said \nto be an improvement\
    \ over the blockchain structure. It pro-\nvides data-friendly services to all\
    \ and sundry no matter their \nlocation or background. Ethereum consists of full\
    \ nodes that \nrun the Ethereum Virtual machine to deploy distributed pro-\ngrams\
    \ such as smart contracts. Application development in \nblockchain can be done\
    \ through Ethereum which can also \ncall multiple other blockchain, protocols,\
    \ and cryptocurren-\ncies [30]. Ethereum uses the chain of global computers to\
    \ \noperate and runs smart contracts that are free of intermediar-\nies or third-party\
    \ censorships. Ethereum uses an incentive \nmechanism [31] to encourage programmers\
    \ who run the \nFig. 4  Blockchain technology diagram\n2423\nA Systematic Literature\
    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nEthereum functions\
    \ to compensate for hardware and energy \nused in running decentralized digital\
    \ applications (dapps). \nThese incentives are called Ether which is a cryptocurrency\
    \ \nin the Ethereum protocol.\n1.1.4  Blockchain Development Platforms and Tools\n\
    To simplify the blockchain processes and to ease the devel-\nopment various tools\
    \ and programming languages have been \nintroduced.\n1.1.4.1 Ethereum Virtual\
    \ Machine (EVM) The executing \ncode and the Executing machine consist of an abstraction\
    \ \nwhich is referred to as virtual machines, and Ethereum vir-\ntual machines\
    \ increase the intended code execution chances, \nand the consensus is maintained\
    \ on it [32].\n1.1.4.2 Remix IDE Remix Integrated Development Envi-\nronment is\
    \ open-source software for web or desktop devel-\nopment. An intuitive and appealing\
    \ interface remix allows \nsmart contract development and Ethereum interaction\
    \ [33]. \nRemix IDE has multiple plugin options such as Web3 inte-\ngration, embedded\
    \ Web3, and Javascript for running the \ncontract locally. Solidity smart contract\
    \ programming lan-\nguage is used for development in Remix IDE.\n1.1.4.3 Smart\
    \ Contracts Simple programs stored on the \nblockchain comprise some predefined\
    \ conditions [34]. \nUpon meeting the conditions the contract is self-executed\
    \ \ngiving the edge of non-intermediary processes as well as \ntime efficiency.\
    \ Multiple programming languages are used \nto develop smart contracts for blockchain;\
    \ a few of them \nhave been discussed below:\n• Solidity [35]: A highly preferred\
    \ object-oriented design-\nbased, high-level language conveniently made for \n\
    developing smart contracts. Most of the solidity syntax \ninspiration came from\
    \ C ++ , Javascript, and Python pro-\ngramming languages. Solidity, along with\
    \ being the top \nsmart contract language focusing on EVM in certain also \nsupports\
    \ inheritance and user-defined types.\n• Vyper [36]: Highly influenced by python\
    \ and the sec-\nond-best after Solidity, vyper is based on three important \n\
    principles namely auditability to ensure the readability \nand understandability\
    \ of the code for the user, Security \nto ensure secure smart contracts, and Simplicity\
    \ of the \nlanguage and the implementation.\n• Yul [37]: An intermediate smart\
    \ contract development \nlanguage that includes the bytecode compilation accord-\n\
    ing to different backend needs. The main focuses of Yul \nare simplicity in bytecode\
    \ translation, understandability, \nand readability of the scripted programs.\
    \ Yul supports \nstack machines and is specifically tailored for them, \nwhole-program\
    \ optimization, and static type reference \nand value nature.\n1.1.4.4 Hyperledger\
    \ A Linux framework for blockchain \ndevelopment that provides standards and tools\
    \ for open-\nsource blockchain applications [38]. Hyperledger enterprise \nhelps\
    \ build permissioned blockchain solutions for busi-\nnesses and services. Under\
    \ the Hyperledger Framework, \nmultiple projects have been introduced:\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric: A modular permissioned and private \nframework for blockchain technology\
    \ used for develop-\ning solutions for businesses and private enterprises. Fab-\n\
    ric has a well updated smart contract interaction, faster \ntransactions, and\
    \ efficient data sharing.\n• Hyperledger Explorer: Explorer is a user-friendly\
    \ block-\nchain development web application tool. The interface \nprovides detailed\
    \ information about the blocks, trans-\nactions, network nodes, and the state\
    \ of the blocks. \nHyperledger Explorer uses visualization tools for repre-\n\
    senting the blockchain data in a user-friendly and read-\nable manner.\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Sawtooth: By separating the core system, \nthat is, specifying the business\
    \ rules without interact-\ning with the application domain is the main task of\
    \ \nhyperledger sawtooth. It supports the Practical Byzantine \nFault Tolerance\
    \ (PBFT) as well as the Proof of Elapsed \nTime (POET). The smart contracts can\
    \ be developed and \nrun on the platform without actually knowing the core \n\
    system’s design.\nFig. 5  Blockchain components\n2424\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\n• Hyperledger Caliper: A blockchain benchmark tool, the \ncaliper used\
    \ pre-defined uses cases to test the blockchain \nsolutions along with a test\
    \ result of its performance. Cali-\nper has a very proficient success rate for\
    \ testing the suc-\ncessful and failed transactions, provides the maximum, \n\
    minimum, and average latency of transaction and read \ndata for the test cycle.\n\
    Limitations of Blockchain are limited but cannot be disre-\ngarded [39]. From\
    \ the creation of the node to the validation \nby miners, Blockchain consumes\
    \ a lot of energy. Splitting of \nthe chain is another problem where a node does\
    \ not accept \nthe transactions in a new chain if it is operating to the old \n\
    software. The computing requirements increase as the block-\nchain grows. Since\

    \ the immutability and \ntransparency of the blockchain cease to exist.\n1.1.5\
    \  Blockchain for Smart Village Applications\nThe scenario in a typical village\
    \ is such, in terms of the \ninfrastructure most of it is inadequately built,\
    \ there exists \nschools and colleges but poorly maintained, poorly built \nhouses\
    \ with no constraints for disaster management. In \nterms of necessities, normal\
    \ villages lack stable electricity \nsupplies, or a secure income to support electricity\
    \ bills, and \nnon-purified water. People in villages are often neglected \nand\
    \ most of the dwellers don’t have any personal or national \nidentity. The healthcare\
    \ system in villages is simple and inef-\nficient which does not help during major\
    \ problems. Normal \nvillages lack any technological advancement and people \n\
    there live in history because of the lacking development. \nSustainable development\
    \ with the concept of smart villages \ncan give a secure and feasible future to\
    \ the villages.\nBeyond the conventional use of blockchain in finance \nusing\
    \ cryptocurrency, numerous applications can change the \nway we perceive digitization.\
    \ According to Kandaswamy \n[40], blockchain can have four types of initiatives:\
    \ block-\nchain disruptor, digital asset, efficiency play, and record-\nkeeper\
    \ (Fig. 6). With similar inventiveness some of the \nblockchain applications with\
    \ the concept of a smart village \ncan be enumerated as:\nHealthcare: Blockchain\
    \ with its record-keeping charac-\nteristics and smart contract with its privacy\
    \ and security has \ngreatly assisted the medical area by providing a solution\
    \ \nfor publicly or semi-private sharing of the medical data of \npatients. This\
    \ can help the researchers and students to elicit \na new solution or use it for\
    \ clinical trials [41]. The solution \nfor missing health documents or previous\
    \ clinic visit records \ncan be improved through blockchain. The potential of\
    \ Block-\nchain to store patient’s record on the ledger make it possible \nto\
    \ get treatment across the globe. Furthermore, the problem \nof counterfeit drugs\
    \ in the market can be resolved through \nthe traceability solution from blockchain\
    \ through which fake \nmedicines can be traced and removed from the supply chain.\n\
    International payments and insurance: Accelerated pay-\nment to international\
    \ locations is possible through block-\nchain technology. Several Bitcoin-operated\
    \ services make it \neasier to transfer money cross-border. The process includes\
    \ \nconverting the payer’s local currency into Bitcoin bypass-\ning the existing\
    \ banking infrastructure and then converting \nthat Bitcoin into the receiver’s\
    \ local currency. This saves the \ntrade cost and speeds up the transaction. Apart\
    \ from that, \nthe insurance industry can also be benefitted from block-\nchain\
    \ technology [42]. Blockchain can provide a transparent \nand trustworthy system\
    \ to overcome the challenges of the \ninsurance industry. Fraudulent claims, intermediary\
    \ payment \ntransactions, and big data handling are some of the many \nissues\
    \ faced by insurance companies. Blockchain can resolve \nthe issues through its\
    \ security and transparency provided by \nthe distributed ledger which also furnishes\
    \ the authentic-\nity of the participants. Besides, its characteristic of record-\n\
    keeping comes in handy with the huge amount of customer \ndata that is immutable\
    \ in the blockchain ledger. Additionally, \nby using the smart contracts real-time\
    \ data of the claims, \nreimbursements or payments can be fetched from multiple\
    \ \nsystems in no time.\nPersonal Identity Record-keeping: Identity is an integral\
    \ \npart of society that provides a unique character and sense \nof acceptability\
    \ in a country. However, physical forms of \nnational identity are not accessible\
    \ to many people around \nthe world. The absence of identity makes it difficult\
    \ for \npeople to participate in voting, banking, employment and \nlimits the\
    \ chances of access to the financial system. Here \nblockchain steps in by providing\
    \ identity solutions through \nFig. 6  Blockchain elements\n2425\nA Systematic\
    \ Literature Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\ndigital\
    \ identity. Additionally, self-sovereign identity arranges \noptions to store\
    \ one's identity on devices accessible across \nthe world [43].\nSupply chain\
    \ and logistics: Blockchain can bring great \nusability to supply chain management.\
    \ Procurement, trace-\nability, digital payments, and logistics are some areas\
    \ that \nhave benefitted from blockchain technology. The distributed \nledger\
    \ can reduce the sharing of operational data by provid-\ning a full view of the\
    \ sale/purchase data, accessible from \nany device. Fraud in the food supply chain\
    \ is prevalent in \nmany countries. Counterfeit products selling in the market\
    \ \nprove hazardous to the consumer. The Block chain’s QR \ntracking system along\
    \ with digitized physical products can \nbe used to track products from production\
    \ to delivery [44]. \nThis technology has started benefiting the agricultural\
    \ sec-\ntor to develop food safety and smart farming increasing the \nincome of\
    \ small farms and food producers.\nEducation: Keeping physical records and transcripts\
    \ can \nbe a hassle. This blockchain provides a solution for digitiz-\ning student\
    \ records, transcripts, and payment receipts [45]. \nDigital record-keeping can\
    \ benefit a student as it will be \nacceptable by universities across the globe,\
    \ free of manipula-\ntion, and handy. Blockchain can also be used to incentivize\
    \ \nstudents through a course credit system. The credit can be \ntranslated to\
    \ cryptocurrency, which can be further used as \nfee payment.\nBlockchain with\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT): Powerful \nunion of two futuristic technologies\
    \ makes machine-to-\nmachine transactions easier. The decentralized authority\
    \ \nof blockchain combined with the smart devices run by IoT \nallows a function\
    \ to autonomously execute without a central \nauthority [46]. Smart IoT run devices\
    \ can be implemented \non edge devices, reducing data transfer costs, and security\
    \ \nissues with the blockchain collaboration [47]. Blockchain \nintegration with\
    \ IoT can highly change the agricultural sec-\ntor. Supply chain traceability\
    \ could benefit the farmers in \neliminating the intermediaries through traceability\
    \ and RFID \ntag-based applications. Water, soil, climate, and other sen-\nsory-type\
    \ IoT devices can help in monitoring the agricultural \nactivities and gathering\
    \ the farm data and activities such as \ncultivation and livestock data in the\
    \ blockchain ledger. IoT \nwith blockchain will certainly revolutionize and transform\
    \ \nmany rural and urban sectors.\n1.2  Motivation and Major Contributions\nSustainable\
    \ Rural development starts with the participation \nof rural people in improving\
    \ their lifestyle. Without the peo-\nple working for their development, any implementation\
    \ or \nhelp is incomplete. Economic and technological sector links \nare important\
    \ for rural areas to develop. Along with that, a \nhealthy agricultural sector\
    \ improves the dweller’s linkage to \nthe global supply sector. By managing the\
    \ social, economic, \nenvironmental, and health objectives the development can\
    \ be \nfast-forwarded. There is a considerable amount of potential \nin rural\
    \ people which can be applied to employment issues, \nsocial disparities, E-governance,\
    \ women's rights etcetera. \nDeveloping rural areas can benefit nationally, economically,\
    \ \nand financially. This systematic literature review aims to pro-\nvide extensive\
    \ literature related to blockchain’s application \nin rural development and sustainable\
    \ living. A plethora of \nblockchain review papers available does not provide\
    \ a col-\nlective literature review of blockchain applications divided \ninto\
    \ different areas directed towards rural and sustainable \ndevelopment. Therefore,\
    \ clear and concise information can \nbe gained about blockchain’s work in improving\
    \ rural devel-\nopment providing scope for future research in this direction.\
    \ \nThe primary contributions are mentioned below:\n• A systematic review of relevant\
    \ literature for research \ntrends, key applications, and areas of implementing\
    \ \nBlockchain Technology for smart villages for sustain-\nable rural development.\n\
    • Identification of major issues in rural development and \nhow they can be addressed\
    \ using Blockchain Technology.\n• Exploration of the existing software, platforms,\
    \ and tools \nfor the implementation of Blockchain in Rural Develop-\nment.\n\
    • Identifications of the research gaps and future research \ndirections for applying\

    \ Review on Blockchain \nTechnology for Sustainable Rural \nDevelopment\nThe literature\
    \ review consists of the collective work of \nblockchain in rural development.\
    \ A total of 6 areas of \napplication were identified after careful extraction\
    \ of data \nand transformation globally namely: Agriculture, Bank-\ning, Environment,\
    \ Energy, Employment, and Healthcare. A \ndetailed discussion on the related work\
    \ is discussed in the \nsubsections.\n4.1  Agriculture\nIn the agriculture sector,\
    \ most of the application areas \nincluded supply chain traceability, facilitation\
    \ of smart agri-\nculture, and incentivization of services (Fig. 14). A detailed\
    \ \nsummary is given in Tables 5, 6, and 7.\n4.1.1  Supply Chain Traceability\n\
    The author F. Tian, [51] studied the integration of RFID \n(Radio-frequency Identification)\
    \ and blockchain technology \nin building the agri-food supply chain traceability\
    \ system. \nWith the help of blockchain technology, the information \nshared and\
    \ traceability is guaranteed. Apart from the sup-\nply chain, it also regulates\
    \ food safety and quality supervi-\nsion. This system can enhance the credibility\
    \ and reliabil-\nity of agri-food safety information. With the depletion of \n\
    an application cost, this system can effectively change the \ncurrent supply chain\
    \ to be more quality-enhanced and safe. \nSimilarly, Hua et al. proposed an agriculture\
    \ [65] provenance \nsystem based on blockchain featured by decentralization, \n\
    collective maintenance, consensus trust, and reliable data \nto solve the trust\
    \ crisis in the product supply chain. The \nsystem’s Target is to record information\
    \ related to the pro-\nduction supply chain: production, processing, storage,\
    \ trans-\nportation, and distribution of agricultural products. It also \nfacilitates\
    \ Recordkeeping from basic planting information \nto provenance records. The proposed\
    \ work solved the issue \nof the credibility of data and the difficulty of integrating\
    \ the \nsubsystem of each company.\nThe paper by Casado-Vara et al., [58] addressed\
    \ the issues \nof the current supply chain such as communication gaps \nbetween\
    \ vendors or the opacity of the origin of the product. \nThe author has proposed\
    \ a new model of the supply chain \nvia blockchain where all the members of the\
    \ supply chain \nsave all their transactions in the blockchain to ensure higher\
    \ \nsecurity. This model also enables a circular economy that \nis a make-use-recycle\
    \ model. With this model, all products \ncan be traced from their origin to their\
    \ sale and subsequent \nrecycling.\nFurther, Caro et al., [70] presented AgriBlockIoT\
    \ which \nis a fully decentralized blockchain-based traceability solu-\ntion for\
    \ agricultural food supply chain management. The \nproposed architecture based\
    \ on API includes a controller to \nconvert high-level function calls to corresponding\
    \ for the \nblockchain layer and blockchain itself which is the main \nFig. 10\

    blockchain can create transparent, fault-tolerant, immuta-\nble, and auditable\
    \ agri-food traceability records. The authors \nLi and Wang, [85] characterized\
    \ the research applications \nof blockchain in food supply traceability. With\
    \ the help of \nblockchain technology and various radiofrequency devices \ncan\
    \ be integrated to collect data from farms, deploy sensors, \nand create intelligent\
    \ contracts to implement server logic. \nThe new system can change the traditional\
    \ food supply sys-\ntem by making it more convenient, efficient, and trustable.\
    \ \nKim et al., [54] presented a theoretical, end-to-end, vis a vie \n“farm-to-fork”,\
    \ food traceability application named Harvest \nNetwork with the integration of\
    \ Blockchain technology and \nInternet-of-things. The process includes tracing\
    \ the prod-\nucts from processing, grading, transportation, temperature, \nand\
    \ contractual payment all with blockchain, IoT, and smart \ncontracts. This can\
    \ help consumers gain field-level insight \ninto the products. Lin et al., [63]\
    \ proposed an IoT and block-\nchain integrated self-organized, open, and ecological\

    \ \ninformation about the product they buy with the help of a \ntrusted, self-organized\
    \ smart agriculture ecosystem.\nGalvez et al., [78] review the potential of blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology in guaranteeing traceability and authenticity in the \nfood supply\
    \ chain. The review included blockchain solutions \nto traceability problems.\
    \ It explained the use of a chronologi-\ncal distributed database to coordinate\
    \ individual activities. \nBy using a probabilistic approach to enable transparency\
    \ \nand verifiability without a central authority, enabling con-\nsensus on a\
    \ transaction to secure legitimate transactions, \nand time-stamped blocks providing\
    \ immutable records to \npreserve records the traceability issues were solved.\
    \ The \npaper also discussed the Block chain’s concept on the food \nsupply chain\
    \ which provides transparency, efficiency, secu-\nrity, and safety to the food\
    \ produce. According to Kamble \net al., [55], the supply chain practitioners\
    \ found a lack of \nefficiency and transparency which leads to constant threats\
    \ \nto formers and consumers. The system deployed the ISM \nmethodology to identify\
    \ Blockchain technology enablers \nin the agriculture supply chain. The findings\
    \ implied the \nacceptance of blockchain technology as an innovative tool to \n\
    ensure an efficient agriculture supply chain by the practition-\ners. To achieve\
    \ further traceability the farmers could cap-\nture relevant information about\
    \ the agricultural events onto \nthe blockchain to enable transparent and trusting\
    \ sources of \ninformation for the farmers. Kamilaris et al., [60] explored \n\
    how the food supply chain and agriculture were impacted \nby blockchain technology.\

    retailer, and (6) consumer where a web application or device \ncan be used to\
    \ scan the item’s QR code to view its detailed \ninformation. Along with this,\
    \ the author explored various \nchallenges and benefits of the agricultural supply\
    \ chain \nand Blockchain’s collaboration. Salah et al., [66] proposed \na solution\
    \ of eliminating the third parties and centralized \nauthorities in the food supply\
    \ chain along with a security \nsystem for food traceability, transparent records,\
    \ and gov-\nernance of interactions and transactions between the users. \nThe\
    \ model entities are related to providing secure tracking \nof the product and\
    \ payment with Ethereum smart contracts. \nThus, the presented model for traceability\
    \ can be used to \ntrace and track the soybean supply chain. S. Missineo, [75]\
    \ \nproposed a model to secure storage origin provenance for \nfood data. The\
    \ proposed system aims to certify the produc-\ntion and the supply chain concerning\
    \ food local products \nby using Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. The\
    \ \nauthor aimed to ensure the authenticity of typical Sardinian \nproducts and\
    \ to sell them online or offline. The platform \nensured the consumer to check\
    \ the authenticity of the prod-\nuct before the purchase giving details on both\
    \ the production \nchain and supply chain. Jaiswal et al., [86] proposed mul-\n\
    tiple smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain \nfor decentralized\
    \ trading of food grains. The framework \nincluded Peer-to-peer trading, the security\
    \ of food grain \ndata, transparency, user anonymity, trust, and incentives as\
    \ \nkey features. The design of the framework consisted of four \ncontracts namely\
    \ food grain supply, bidding, trading, and \nutilization for the supply chain\
    \ management. Dong et al., \n[56] proposed a collaborative model of blockchain\
    \ and IoT \nin the agriculture sector. The data collection and transmis-\nsion\
    \ can be distinguished through a unique identity card \ngiven to each agricultural\
    \ product. All the environmental \naspects of the agricultural process can be\
    \ gathered at the \nsource. Along with that crop growth information, circulation\
    \ \nof the product using an RFID tag and distribution process \ncan also be recorded\
    \ and stored on the distributed ledger. \nA QR code attached to the product can\
    \ be scanned by the \nconsumer to view product information in details.\nFig. 14\

    \ \n1 3\nWithal, Madumidha et al., [145] proposed the use of \nblockchain technology\
    \ to maintain tamper-proof records, \navoid intermediaries and provide security\
    \ to the transac-\ntions which in turn reduces transaction costs and improves\
    \ \nthe quality of the products. The food products are labeled \nwith RFID tags\
    \ to maintain the supply chain. The author \nexplained the revolutionary changes\
    \ blockchain technology \ncan bring to the supply chains and how it can increase\
    \ the \neconomic conditions of a country by reducing corruption \nrates and increasing\
    \ the satisfaction of producers and con-\nsumers. Paul et al., [83] proposed a\
    \ way to eliminate inter-\nmediaries between farmers and consumers to provide\
    \ the \nright amount for the farm produce. The proposed system \nconsists of blockchain\
    \ nodes namely Supply companies, \nlandowners, markets, and farmers. The farmer\
    \ node sets the \namount after the agreement period, the market node collects\
    \ \nand stores crops and stops intermediaries from manipulating \nthe prices,\
    \ the landlord node collects the money from the \nland on lease, and the supply\
    \ company node sells extra agri-\ncultural products to the farmers. This platform\
    \ named KHET \nwhere all the nodes are interconnected through Ethereum \nblockchain\
    \ is beneficial for farmers, landlords, and markets.\nMusah et al., [62] main\
    \ objective in proposing the role of \nblockchain in Ghana’s cocoa beans food\
    \ supply chain was \nto evaluate the contributions made by applications of block-\n\
    chain technology in the supply chain. The system provides \na global traceability\
    \ platform, supply chain intelligence and \nvisibility, Africa cocoa village;\
    \ impact the investing for \nsmallholder farmer and uses Bean tracker. The author\
    \ care-\nfully studied the tools and platforms benefiting the cocoa \nbean production\
    \ and supply chain processes.\nAdditionally, Baralla et al., [146] proposed a\
    \ blockchain-\nbased generic agri-food supply chain traceability system \nfor\
    \ implementing the farm-to-fork model. In this system, \na QR code scan can allow\
    \ the consumer to reconstruct the \nproduct history to verify product health and\
    \ quality. The \nmain contribution of this article was the authentication and\
    \ \nverification of shared data’s integrity in supply chain man-\nagement. With\
    \ the help of this system, the involved operators \ncould identify any new participants\
    \ along with the supply \nchain which increased the degree of trust between organiza-\n\
    tions and individuals. Dakshayini et al., [87] proposed an \nintegrated model\
    \ based on Blockchain, big data, and cloud \nto efficiently manage crops that\
    \ achieve effective demand-\nbased decision support, simplified, transparent,\
    \ and secure \nagricultural supply chain. The proposed model has a higher \npercentile\
    \ of achieving demand and supply of crops which \navoids the farmer’s loss, catering\
    \ to consumer’s needs, pro-\nvides sustainable agricultural practices, reducing\
    \ middlemen \ninvolvement, and reducing price inflation problems. Saji \net al.,\

    \ Villages \n1 3\nnew markets. The system improved farming profitability \nand\
    \ endorsed the financial stability of cultivators. It also \nprovided health benefits,\
    \ reduced food wastage, eliminated \nmanipulation, and adulteration, and supports\
    \ the supply \nchain of agro-products. Saurabh and Dey, [69] identified the \n\
    potential divers of blockchain concerning the grape wine \nsupply chain. The smart\
    \ contract-based module was con-\nstructed to ensure trust between participants\
    \ during trans-\nactions. The proposed model enhanced the customization, \ncompetitiveness,\
    \ and usability of the supply chain.\nIqbal and Butt, [84] proposed a model to\
    \ save the farm-\ner’s crops from animals at night. A repelling and notifying\
    \ \nsystem (RNS) is installed in the field that receives signals \nduring an animal\
    \ attack. Human-safe ultrasonic waves are \nproduced by this RNS which drives\
    \ the animals away. This \nproposal also consists of a farm management system\
    \ that \nreceives the report regarding the hazards caused in the fields. \nThis\
    \ system enabled timely data delivery, efficient multi-hop \ncommunication, dependable\
    \ data transmission, and low-cost \ntechnology. Chun-Ting et al., [73] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-\nbased agricultural traceability service platform for tamper-\n\
    proof data storing and backup. The system design consists of \nData collecting\
    \ layer where IoT sensors collect environmen-\ntal data, the blockchain layer\
    \ takes data from the formal layer \nand sends them to blockchain nodes and later\
    \ to blocks, and \nthe application layer handles the requests to access transac-\n\
    tion data based on the transaction hash. Hegde et al., [81] \npresented different\
    \ ways of implementing blockchain with \nthe agricultural supply chain. With the\
    \ use of blockchain, the \nproducers can get data and income security, and keep\
    \ track \nof environmental changes that affect the crops. The trace-\nability\
    \ option provides clarity in any damage that occurred \nto the product and an\
    \ overall increase in efficiency can be \nachieved by producing only required\
    \ products hence reduc-\ning wastage. Peña et al., [89] presented a systematic\
    \ review \non blockchain in food supply chain management in Ecua-\ndor. According\
    \ to the review, most of the work was done in \nHyperledger composer, models for\
    \ business interactions and \nhuman interactions, Traceability, Security, and\
    \ Blockchain \nInformation.\nAdditionally, M. Kumarathunga, [57] after reviewing\
    \ \npresented the way to reduce transaction costs and improve \nfarmer’s involvement\
    \ in agricultural supply chains. To \nreduce transaction costs farmers can participate\
    \ in Infor-\nmation sharing, goal congruence, decision synchronization, \nincentive\
    \ alignment, resource sharing, collaborative commu-\nnication, joint knowledge\
    \ creation. Xu et al., [80] reviewed \nthe working principle of blockchain technology\
    \ in the agri-\nfood sector. Blockchain technology provided data transpar-\nency,\
    \ data traceability, food safety, and quality monitoring, \nand agriculture finance.\
    \ Additionally, food safety and qual-\nity can be secured by digitizing products.\
    \ According to the \nreview, blockchain revealed a better approach to the future\
    \ \nof the agri-food supply chain which is safer, healthier, sus-\ntainable, and\
    \ reliable. Mirabelli and Solina, [71] collected \nand analyzed the applications\
    \ of blockchain technology and \nits contribution to agricultural food traceability\
    \ issues. The \nreview showed that the usability of blockchain technol-\nogy in\
    \ the agricultural sector was still in the early stage. \nThe review highlighted\
    \ three main aspects namely starting \nproblem, area of interest, and contribution.\
    \ Blockchain can \nbe a valid way to minimize fraud and errors in agricultural\
    \ \nsupply chains by increasing the quality and safety of food \nproducts. Shahid\
    \ et al., [53] have proposed a complete solu-\ntion to the blockchain-based agricultural\
    \ and food supply \nchain. The paper aimed to provide an end-to-end solution \n\
    to the growing blockchain-based agri-food supply chains. \nFurther, it achieved\
    \ the following properties: accountability, \ncredibility, auditability, autonomy,\
    \ and authenticity. The sys-\ntem also acted as a better alternative to the existing\
    \ supply \nchain system by enabling a scalable and auditable system. \nAwan et al.,\
    \ [79] proposed a smart agricultural model as a \ntransformation to the traditional\
    \ agricultural supply chain. \nThe system consists of Seed seller, Farmer, Crop\
    \ buyer, \nProcessor, Crop storage, Distributor, Retailer, Customer. \nTo improve\
    \ the food supply chain’s productivity and reli-\nability the smart model was\
    \ proposed. The model allowed \nfarmers to enter and monitor the data in the plant.\
    \ The main \nobjective of this model was to provide equal opportunities to \n\
    the participants of the agricultural food supply chain. The-\njaswini and Ranjitha,\
    \ [64] proposed a model that explores \nthe problems faced by people in agriculture\
    \ production and \nits solutions based on blockchain technology. Blockchain \n\
    solutions for traceability of crops, disclosure of data, clarity \nin food production,\
    \ and authentic agricultural products was \nproposed by the author. This proposed\
    \ model ensured food \nsafety, benefitted farmers, and stakeholders.\nYadav et al.,\
    \ [67] reviewed the blockchain adoption bar-\nriers in the Indian agricultural\
    \ supply chain. The barriers \ncan be enumerated as Lack of proper government\
    \ regulation \nand regularity uncertainty, Huge resource, and initial capital\
    \ \nrequirement, security and privacy concerns, lack of interop-\nerability and\
    \ standardization, etc. Further, the barriers were \nmodeled using an integrated\
    \ ISM-DEMATEL approach \nwhich provided limited interpretative logic. W. Lin,\
    \ [59] \nprovided a survey to study the techniques and applications \nof blockchain\
    \ technology. The application categories of \nblockchain in agriculture are Provenance\
    \ traceability and \nfood authentication, smart farming data management, trade\
    \ \nfinance in the supply chain management, and other informa-\ntion management\
    \ systems. The paper also indicated possible \nfuture developments and applications\
    \ of blockchain. Dutta \net al., [61] reviewed articles related to blockchain\
    \ technol-\nogy’s integration with various supply chain operations. The \nbenefits\
    \ of Blockchain in supply chains can be enumer-\nated as Data management, Improvement\
    \ in transparency, \n2444\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nImprovement in response\
    \ time smart contract management, \nOperational efficiency, and Disintermediation,\

    \ the main supply chain functions were identified \nas supply chain provenance,\
    \ supply chain resilience, supply \nchain re-engineering, security enhancement,\
    \ business pro-\ncess management, and product management. The work also \nexamined\
    \ various challenges and impacts of blockchain in \nthe supply chain. Shahid et al.,\
    \ [77] proposed a solution for \na blockchain-based reputation system in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfood supply chain. The system model consisted of invoking \nsmart contracts\
    \ to provide reviews based on the services to \nthe providers. The reviews are\
    \ requested by buyers and the \nsellers’ review the transactions and perform other\
    \ transac-\ntions based on that. The system was proposed to maintain \nthe immutability\
    \ and integrity of the registered review. \nTorky and Hassanein, [82] presented\
    \ a comprehensive sur-\nvey on IoT and blockchain and their importance in devel-\n\
    oping smart applications. According to the review, crops \noverseeing, livestock\
    \ grazing, and food supply chain are a \nfew subsectors in precision agriculture\
    \ managed by block-\nchain platforms. Apart from that, a novel blockchain model\
    \ \nwas also proposed to use as an important solution for major \nchallenges in\
    \ IoT-based precision agricultural systems. The \nobjectives of Skender and Zaninović,\
    \ [74] in their paper \nwere to analyze blockchain technology’s overall perspec-\n\
    tive, investigate its potential in a sustainable supply chain \nto replace the\
    \ shortcomings in the traditional supply chain. \nThe traceability and transparency\
    \ in the agricultural supply \nchain can be improved with blockchain.\nTo better\
    \ understand the benefits and challenges and the \nperspective for sustainable\
    \ blockchain, the author provided \na conceptual framework. Borah et al., [68]\
    \ proposed a novel \nblockchain-based Farmer and Rely called FARMAR. The \nsystem\
    \ could provide fair prices and reduce duping by mid-\ndlemen. The assets can\
    \ be traced from farmers to consumers, \nreducing the artificial inflation of\
    \ prices. Ferrag et al., (2020) \n[76] reviewed the research challenges on IoT-based\
    \ agricul-\nture and its security and privacy issues. The rest of the paper \n\
    identified threat models against green IoT-based agriculture \nanalyzed the privacy-oriented\
    \ blockchain-based solutions \nand consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture.\
    \ \nEnescu and Ionescu, [52] proposed a model for farmers in \nthe agri-food sector\
    \ using blockchain. This system ensures a \ncredible supply chain for producers\
    \ and consumers, guaran-\nteed timely payments between the participants. The authors\
    \ \nproposed this system to provide transparency, security, and \ntrust in the\
    \ trading process. Chaudhari et al., [90] proposed \na framework for a secure\
    \ and transparent supply chain with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With\
    \ the help of this sys-\ntem, the farmers can get a fair price for their products.\
    \ This \ntransparent and tamper-proof supply chain system generates \na bill at\
    \ the end including the commissioning price as well as \nthe total price after\
    \ sold product hence benefiting the farm-\ners in knowing the selling and market\
    \ price. Xie et al., [91] \nproposed to construct a traceability framework For\
    \ fresh \nE-commerce agricultural product quality and safety based \non blockchain\
    \ technology. To access the key control points \nthe author used the FMECA (failure\
    \ model effect and key \nanalysis) to analyze the failure mode, impact, and hazards\
    \ \nin the traceability chain. This system can promote agricul-\ntural development\
    \ through decentralization, consensus trust, \nmaintenance, and reliable database\
    \ features.\nFurthermore, Li et al., [92] proposed a blockchain-based \nTraceability\
    \ of the fresh food supply chain With the help of \nbusiness process reengineering\
    \ (BPR). The overall traceabil-\nity architecture is based on key links’ product\
    \ quality data \nand participants’ transactions. The objective of this trace-\n\
    ability system was to ensure data integrity. Flores et al., [93] \nproposed a\
    \ model for decentralization of data and provide \ntraceability of agricultural\
    \ products with blockchain tech-\nnology. Using this method could guarantee transparency\
    \ of \nthe supply chain and other operations as well as the transac-\ntions involved.\
    \ Fernandez et al., [94] proposed a Blockchain-\nbased model to improve farmer’s\
    \ profits. The author aimed \nto improve the output primitives of the supply chain.\
    \ Farmer-\nto-consumer product tracking and cost were the main factors \nin improving\
    \ traceability in the supply chain. Cortez-Zaga \net al., [95] proposed a model\
    \ used in the Peruvian agricul-\ntural sector using blockchain. When using blockchain\
    \ it can \neliminate dependence on a central entity, provides integrity \nof the\
    \ process, transactions become irrevocable, secure, \nand private, and provides\
    \ transparency and immutability. \nG. Zhao, [96] presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that \nexplored the advances in the agri-food supply chain. The \npaper\
    \ also pointed out the challenge of the applications of \nblockchain technology\
    \ enumerated as storage capacity and \nscalability, privacy leakage, high-cost\
    \ problem, regulation \nproblem, throughput and latency issues, and lack of skills.\n\
    Land record maintenance using blockchain was also \nproposed by Bhorshetti et al.,\
    \ for easy maintenance of land \nrecords in real-time. The database proved to\
    \ be a non-failure \nsystem and the work provided intermediary-less land title\
    \ \ntransfer and processing between owners. This system pro-\nvided security,\
    \ transparency, and a broker-free land man-\nagement system [97]. The paper by\
    \ Thakur et al. presented \nthe issues related to land records maintenance, registration,\
    \ \nsettlements, and banks. The system ensured better land man-\nagement, lesser\
    \ fraudulent transactions while strengthening \nthe sustainable development goals\
    \ (SDG) and increasing the \nGDP of the country [98].\n4.1.2  Agriculture Security\
    \ System\nTse et al., [102] proposed food supply information security \nbased\
    \ on blockchain technology. The use of blockchain in \n2445\nA Systematic Literature\
    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nthis system can regain\
    \ the people’s trust in the food mar-\nket, the government can collect statistics\
    \ on various kinds \nof food, and adulterated and fake food in the market can\
    \ \nbe eliminated. This type of technology can benefit the cus-\ntomer, manufacturers,\
    \ and supervision departments of the \nfood supply chain. Wu and Tsai, [103] proposed\
    \ an intel-\nligent agriculture network security system by applying dark \nweb\
    \ technology to monitor packet transmission frequency in \norder to prevent DDOS\
    \ attacks. The system applied a dark-\nnet mechanism to identify anyone who attempts\
    \ to access \nblockchain data. It also incorporated IoT sensors to gather \ndata\
    \ regarding temperature, humidity, and soil. This model \nwas proposed to keep\
    \ track of the farms and cultivation fac-\ntors related to an environment and\
    \ to establish network secu-\nrity for IoT networks.\n4.1.3  Organic Farming\n\
    Reddy and Kumar, [101] presented the article based on the \nsustainability of\
    \ the food supply chain. The author's objec-\ntive was to achieve Fair Trading\
    \ and a circular economy with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With this framework,\
    \ the \nfollowing results but achieved: Automatic hashing for less \nelectricity\
    \ consumption, product malfunctioning and add \nalteration, the involvement of\
    \ middlemen, availability of \nfarming jobs, and facilitating development and\
    \ unity among \nfarmers. According to Basnayake and Rajapakse, [104], the \npurpose\
    \ of the research was to implement a Blockchain-\nbased solution to verify food\
    \ quality. The process included \nFarmers issuing a product contract to control\
    \ the quality of \neach product. For each deployment of the product contract,\
    \ \nit would return an address that was used to generate the QR \ncode to identify\
    \ the physical product. Lastly, Consumers \nwere also eligible to rate the product\
    \ quality to ensure trust.\n4.1.4  Smart Agriculture\nTo overcome remote monitoring\
    \ challenges and provide \nsecurity and privacy in agriculture, Patil et al.,\
    \ [105] pro-\nposed a lightweight architecture for smart greenhouse farm-\ning.\
    \ The model consisted of four groups showing the integra-\ntion of blockchain\
    \ with IoT namely (1) smart greenhouse, (2) \noverlay network, (3) Cloud storage,\
    \ and (4) End-user. This \nmodel can be used to successfully monitor the secure\
    \ trans-\nmission of greenhouse data. Umamaheshwari et al., [106] \nproposed a\
    \ model for Buying and selling crops and land. \nThe model used Ethers as a cryptocurrency.\
    \ According to \nthe paper, the recordkeeping of crops grown in the land was \n\
    useful to know the history of plantations in the land. With \nthe help of this\
    \ model, users were able to access real-time \ndata about crops, eliminate the\
    \ need for middlemen, and \nestablish a transparent and efficient system. Voutos\
    \ et al., \n[107] proposed the integration of IoT and smart contracts \nto develop\
    \ smart agriculture to deliver higher quality agri-\ncultural products. It also\
    \ focuses on improving the associ-\nated supply chain and logistics benefiting\
    \ the participants \ninvolved. The author discussed the factors of smart agri-\n\
    culture as soil factors, climate, sensors, research, supply \nchain, storage,\
    \ analytics, and smart contracts. Miloudi et al., \n[100] proposed IoT, Blockchain,\
    \ and Geospatial technology-\nbased Smart farming to manage the farming practices\
    \ more \nsmartly and sustainably. The system proposed smart farming \nmanagement\
    \ in 4 stages namely (1) Integrated blockchain \nwith IoT platform where various\
    \ IoT sensors apply analytics \nand sends data to the blockchain, (2) Blockchain\
    \ Working \nMethodology where data visibility is provided through smart \ncontracts,\
    \ (3) Integrating GIS with blockchain where the \ndata sent from IoT sensors are\
    \ improvised and accuracy is \nfacilitated through GIS geospatial tools, and (4)\
    \ certifying \nfarmers in blockchain stage facilitates authorities and privi-\n\
    leges to the farmers through smart contracts which could \ngreatly benefit farmers\
    \ and food production industry.\nFurthermore, Devi Et al., [108] Proposed a design\
    \ archi-\ntecture by merging IoT and BC for smart agriculture. The \nnodes involved\
    \ in the blockchain received the information \nfrom the sensors that were connected\
    \ to the things involved \nin the Smart Agriculture monitoring process. The design\
    \ \narchitecture enhanced the security and data transparency \nperformance of\
    \ smart agriculture. Vangala et al., [109] \nreviewed blockchain technology and\
    \ its information security \nschemes. The application areas covered by the authors\
    \ were \nagriculture monitoring, controlled agriculture/smart green-\nhouses,\
    \ food supply chain tracking, and precision farming/\nsmart farming. The review\
    \ also presented a thorough analy-\nsis of the security attributes, application\
    \ areas, advantages, \ndrawbacks, and competing schemes’ cost of computation \n\
    and communication. Branco et al., [110] proposed a con-\nceptual approach with\
    \ the integration of IoT and blockchain \nfor a mushroom farm distribution process\
    \ control system. \nThe proposed system allowed the collection of distributed\
    \ \ndata on the environmental factors contributing to mushroom \nproduction providing\
    \ collection, storage, and processing of \nmushroom farm data to be scalable,\
    \ immutable, transparent, \nauditable, and secure.\n4.1.5  Dairy Farming\nMisra\
    \ and Das, [111] presented a conceptual framework \nusing blockchain to bring\
    \ feasibility and efficiency in \nE-governance. The architecture consisted of\
    \ a service-\noriented architecture framework to store details of stake-\nholders\
    \ involved in user services on demand, a blockchain \narchitecture that would\
    \ allow stakeholders to authenticate \nand perform transactions on the ledger,\
    \ and digital identity \narchitecture to act as a regulator in the architecture.\
    \ With \na dairy farmer as a user or participant in the architecture \n2446\n\
    \ \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nwho would benefit from the transactions while\
    \ having vot-\ning rights and leadership entities in the system the author \n\
    conceptually explored the prototype of the dairy coopera-\ntive sector in India.\
    \ Similarly, Rambim and Awuor, [112] \nproposed a model for dairy farmers in Kenya\
    \ that explores \nthe potential use of blockchain technology in milk delivery\
    \ \nin rural areas. From the Naitiri Dairy farmers’ cooperative \n(NADAFA) in\
    \ Kenya, the author introduced a Milk Deliv-\nery Blockchain Manager (MDBM) which\
    \ is a decentralized \nplatform to automatically capture the quantity and quality\
    \ \nof milk delivered by the farmers. The delivery data stored \nin the blockchain\
    \ is immutable, cryptographically hashed, \nand digitally signed. The details\
    \ of delivery are accessible \nto the farmers. The NADAFA facilitates the system\
    \ and pro-\nvides payment to the dairy farmers on time. The consortium-\nbased\
    \ network provides leveraging blockchain solutions for \nfarmers.\n4.1.6  Livestock\n\
    Under Livestock monitoring, Alonso et al., [113] worked on \nimportant trends\
    \ in the applications of IoT and edge comput-\ning paradigms in the smart farming\
    \ field. This helps produc-\ners to optimize processes, provides the origin of\
    \ the product, \nand guarantees the quality to its consumers. The state of \n\
    dairy cattle and feed grain can be monitored in real-time by \nusing artificial\
    \ intelligence and blockchain technology. This \nis to ensure the traceability\
    \ and sustainability of different \nprocesses of farming. The implementation of\
    \ smart farm-\ning contributed to the reduction of data traffic and reliable \n\
    communications between IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. \nAccording to Hang et al.,\
    \ [114], the uncertain data qual-\nity of analysts’ data can be solved through\
    \ blockchain. The \nproposed structure brings scalability, off-chain storage,\
    \ pri-\nvacy, and high throughput as advancement to the previous \nversion. Various\
    \ IoT data is fetched from fish farms such \nas temperature, water level, oxygen,\
    \ and PH data. The data \nstorage can be a database or cloud and end-user can\
    \ view \nthe fish farm’s detailed information through smart devices. \nLeme et al.,\
    \ [147] proposed a novel infrastructure based on \nthe integration of cloud storage\
    \ and blockchain technology \nto monitor the overall health of livestock. The\
    \ components \nof the architecture can be named as (1) Administrator, (2) \nUsers,\
    \ (3) Cloud service, and (4) blockchain network. With \nthe help of RFID tags\
    \ attached to the cattle, various entities \ncan be monitored to ensure that cattle\
    \ go through necessary \nprocedures. Yang et al., [115] proposed a novel method\
    \ to \nensure traceability and authenticity in the livestock supply \nchain using\
    \ blockchain. The model uses RFID-sensor-based \nlivestock monitoring in the food\
    \ industry where the sen-\nsors augment the physical tracking and solved the RFID’s\
    \ \ninherent computational capacity limitation by using cloud \nservices. The\
    \ data is then made accessible to the end con-\nsumer through Block chain’s transparent\
    \ ledger.\n4.1.7  E‑Agriculture\nThe analysis proposed by Li et al., [116] Investigated\
    \ the \nconvenience of sustainable electronic agriculture based on \nBlockchain\
    \ technology and analyzed the application likeli-\nhood and challenges of Blockchain\
    \ in the agricultural field. \nThe authors selected 5 villages with similar development\
    \ \nrates in china and Blockchain technology was applied using \ndata statistics\
    \ to the sustainable e-agriculture for exploring \nits convenience. Results showed\
    \ that sustainable electronic \nagriculture based on Blockchain Technology brought\
    \ great \nconvenience to the farmer’s sales, increasing by 25% on \naverage compared\
    \ with traditional electronic agriculture. \nSong et al. [117], to improve the\
    \ biased point of view, higher \ninitial costs, and lack of transparency and trust\
    \ proposed a \nsystem for providing sustainability in the current agri-food \n\
    supply chain. The paper discussed blockchain adoption in \nrural areas and relative\
    \ energy consumption from supply and \ndemand perspectives.\n4.1.8  Agriculture\
    \ Monitoring\nArshad et al., [99] proposed a private blockchain-based \nsecure\
    \ access control for agriculture to monitor climatic \nparameters. Private Blockchain\
    \ access control (PBAC) was \nused to guarantee secure communications where a\
    \ user usu-\nally goes through initialization, authentication, and revo-\ncation.\
    \ The farms monitoring system consists of the login \nphase, system setup phase,\
    \ user/farm professional registra-\ntion phase, password authentication and session\
    \ key agree-\nment phase, update or change phase, and addition of node \nphase.\
    \ The whole system stores access records and lessen \nthe computational and communication\
    \ overhead. Forbye, \nN. Bore, [118] proposed a model to improve the shortcom-\n\
    ings of existing digitized farming models through the AG-\nWallet System (AGWS).\
    \ The AGWS design consisted of (1) \ndigitizing the far demand–supply, (2) The\
    \ farm information \npipeline was to ensure secure storage and validate events\
    \ \nreceived from IoT, and (3) data analytic services that make \nthe information\
    \ visible to the participants. The system pro-\nposed by Osmanoglu et al., [119]\
    \ uses a blockchain-based \nyield estimation solution. Farmers can share the farming\
    \ \nplans for the upcoming harvesting season with other par-\nticipants, or learn\
    \ from other’s plans to review their plans. \nSmart contracts can be employed\
    \ by participants to share \ntheir yield commitments. The author improvised a\
    \ censor-\nship-resistant, tamper-proof, and immutable public ledger of \ntime-stamped\
    \ transactions.\n2447\nA Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain Technology\
    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n4.1.9  Farmers\nTalreja et al., (2020) [121] proposed\
    \ a farmer’s portal with \nthe help of blockchain technology and python to preserve\
    \ the \ncontract of trade between farmers and consumers. The farm-\ner’s portal\
    \ is a way to access farm activities. The proposed \nwork enhanced the degree\
    \ of participation, reduced inter-\nmediary cost, simplified process, provided\
    \ ease of selling \ncrops, and greater efficiency. The immutability of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology fortified farmers for getting a fair price for their \ncrops and\
    \ reduced operational costs. Abraham and Kumar, \n[120] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ data security system to \npreserve farmer’s data. The proposed work was based\
    \ on a \nprivate-permissioned blockchain for controlled participation, \nhyper\
    \ ledger fabric to support smart contracts, and system \ndesign to safely store\
    \ farm data. The widened blockchain \ndata helps farmer’s data to be accessed\
    \ by other participants \nwhich can allow the government to sanction schemes based\
    \ \non farmer’s data. Topart et al., [122] proposed an interoper-\nable ecosystem\
    \ of farmer’s consent management. The model \nused a permissioned blockchain to\
    \ allow only a specific \ngroup of people to access the services. The immutability\
    \ of \nconsent allows the data to be non-manipulative, distributed, \nsigned transactions,\
    \ and transparent. The consent verifica-\ntion for each data allows only valid\
    \ users to request data. \nThe model was proposed to respect the privacy, security,\
    \ \ntransparency, and consent of the farmer’s data.\n4.1.10  Incentivization\n\
    Blockchain has been using incentive mechanisms since bit-\ncoin to incentivize\
    \ miners, but recently many authors have \npresented ways of promoting work for\
    \ a reward. Incentives \nto promote sustainable agricultural practices by Giaffreda\
    \ \net al., [123]. Objectives include savings and increasing \nmarket value plus\
    \ monitoring the use of water in the fields. \nFarmers have been relying on satellite\
    \ data as it is a cheap \nsource of agricultural services. With the use of LPWAN\
    \ net-\nworks, accuracy in fields is increased along with a tensiom-\neter-a sensing\
    \ unit that is used to wirelessly communicate \nthe data related to the humidity\
    \ of the soil and a mini-meteo \nstation that is used to measure temperature,\
    \ air humidity, and \nair pressure. Smart contracts record the transactions from\
    \ the \ncalculated results in the cloud and release the incentives to \nthe farmer\
    \ according to their deal with the stakeholder. The \nproposal includes EnvCoins\
    \ as the incentives, which can be \nfurther used to buy technologies for sustainable\
    \ agricultural \npractices, for cash, or investment. Esmaeilian et al., [124]\
    \ \nproposed an incentive mechanism for green behavior such \nas waste disposal,\
    \ using re-furbished products, purchasing \nenergy-efficient products, saving\
    \ energy, recover, repair, \nand maintain. The tokens gained from sustainable\
    \ behav-\nior can be further used to access services on blockchain. \nIncentivization\
    \ can ameliorate some of the environmental \nissues in rural areas with the help\
    \ of rural people by moti-\nvating them to clean the areas. OpenLitterMap by S.\
    \ Lynch, \n[125] uses geospatial analysis to geotag various types of \nlitter.\
    \ It uses LitterCoins as an incentive mechanism for the \nproof of work. This\
    \ is to motivate people to submit correct \ndata. It also rewards for uploading\
    \ litter images from a new \nlocation. Apart from plastic and other homogenous\
    \ litter, a \nproposal to eliminate solid waste from small municipalities \nin\
    \ return for a reward is given by França et al., [148]. The \nprovision was to\
    \ change the original system from attack risk, \ndata loss, power outage, and\
    \ other such problems. The new \ndigitized system proves to be a handier as it\
    \ is in the form of \na mobile application. The reward for selling solid waste\
    \ to \nthe collecting agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocurrency sent \nto the\
    \ seller’s virtual wallet. This initiative led to comput-\nerization gains, information\
    \ integrity, and the use of crypto-\ncurrency. Additionally, in [128] D. Zhang,\
    \ worked on a simi-\nlar solution to efficiently use rural waste in incentivizing\
    \ \nrural people. The process includes the installation of smart \nbins and when\
    \ they are full, the collection trucks will swap \nthe waste for a digital coupon\
    \ which the farmer can use to \neither get agricultural products from the waste\
    \ to the energy \nplant or cash them. Blockchain makes it an easier process to\
    \ \ntransfer and record data faster with maximum transparency. \nOther applications\
    \ of incentives for waste include Recereum, \nSwachhCoin, Plastic Bank, 4New,\
    \ and OILSC [129].\nThe motivational incentive mechanism can also transform \n\
    the way medical data is shared for research and diagnosis. In \nthe paper by Zhu\
    \ et al., [126], the authors gave a solution to \nactuate people into sharing\
    \ medical data by providing them \nrewards for doing so. The rewards system is\
    \ based on the \naccess provided by the owner of the medical file. Through \n\
    Smart contracts, a trusted payment money flow can be \ndevised between the third\
    \ party and the owner. The Shapley \nvalue was considered for the revenue distribution\
    \ of medi-\ncal data sharing and to study the impact of consensus on \nthe miner’s\
    \ income. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism \nfor the accident alert system,\
    \ proposed by Devi and Pamila, \n[127] is another blockchain-based medical application.\
    \ \nAccording to the authors, most of the accidents occurs near \nrural places\
    \ where medical help is unreachable on time. To \neliminate the privacy issue\
    \ of the nearby user who receives \nthe accident report, a blockchain-based incentive\
    \ method \nis implemented for the user who receives the accident alert \nto send\
    \ the location of the victim to a close-by emergency \nservice. Then the message\
    \ initiator gets rewarded incen-\ntives for alerting about the accident. A similar\
    \ report system \nmobile application for anonymous reporting is proposed by \n\
    Zou et al., [130] in which reporting any incident can earn \npeople rewards. The\
    \ design goal of the author was to imple-\nment an anonymous report system, to\
    \ provide privacy to the \nperson who reports, without having to give their personal\
    \ \n2448\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\ninformation to the system. This model\
    \ induces incentive \nnamed Rcoins to whoever published the report information,\
    \ \nthe repliers, and the consenting miners. The Blockchain and \nKudos by Sharples\
    \ and Dominigue, [131], a reward-based \npermanent solution as the digital record-keeping\
    \ model. The \nauthor proposed the use of blockchain to store digital certifi-\n\
    cates, achievements, and credits. Stored as a public record \nit can be accessed\
    \ by the institutions or the student online. \nThe model uses Kudos an educational\
    \ reputation currency \nas a reward. The reward can be earned through uploading\
    \ \ncertificates on the blockchain, passing a test, or on course \ncompletion.\
    \ Another application of blockchain-based incen-\ntive system is EduCTX by Turkanović\
    \ et al., [132] which \nis proposed to globally enable the higher education credit\
    \ \nplatform. For potential stakeholders such as educational \ninstitutions, companies,\
    \ and organizations a unified view \nof student’s higher education credits and\
    \ grading system \nis placed on the global ledger through blockchain. ECTX \n\
    tokens will be credited based on the completion of courses \nwhich will act as\
    \ proof of completed courses.\n4.2  Environment\nIn the environment sector, the\
    \ most emphasis was given \non blockchain applications in Natural hazards, Water,\
    \ and \nWaste management in rural areas (Fig. 15). A detailed sum-\nmary is given\
    \ in Table 8.\n4.2.1  Waste Management\nFrom the articles proposed, in D. Zhang,\
    \ [128] the author \nworked on a similar solution to efficiently use rural waste\
    \ \nin incentivizing rural people. This framework is based on \nChina’s Yitong\
    \ system which is waste to energy plant for \nagricultural waste and the use of\
    \ blockchain to provide digi-\ntal coupons or cryptocurrency in return for waste.\
    \ The author \nproposed the use of a web application to use a QR code \nscanner\
    \ when the waste is collected from a smart bin, also \nencouraging segregation\
    \ of agricultural waste and residential \nwaste. The serves receive the weight\
    \ of waste, lodges it on \nthe global ledger, and the coupon is rewarded based\
    \ on the \nweight. Apart from plastic and other homogenous litter, a \nproposal\
    \ to eliminate solid waste from small municipali-\nties in return for a reward\
    \ is given by França et al., [148]. \nThe provision was to change the original\
    \ system from attack \nrisk, data loss, power outage, and other such problems.\
    \ The \nnew digitized system proves to be a handier as it is in the \nform of\
    \ a mobile application. The reward for selling solid \nwaste to the collecting\
    \ agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocur-\nrency sent to the seller’s virtual wallet.\
    \ This initiative led to \ncomputerization gains, information integrity, and the\
    \ use of \ncrypto-currency.\nLatif et al., [133] have addressed the smart waste\
    \ manage-\nment system with the integration of IoT and blockchain. The \nproposed\
    \ model included identification of waste material, \ntrace location, send to trash,\
    \ categorize waste, transfer waste, \nrecycling, and decision-making process.\
    \ The sensor nodes \nin the model were used for waste identification, and adding\
    \ \nnew blocks and the admin and waste management offices \nwere responsible for\
    \ collecting, executing recycling, and \ndelivering products. The recyclable wastes\
    \ are transformed \ninto useful products and share with the customers and send\
    \ \nthe non-recyclable wastes to the trash.\nFig.15  Blockchain applications \n\

    \ smart contracts execute the claims to the farm-\ners. Deployment of the system\
    \ can ensure water supply in \nrural areas and accessibility of insurance in case\
    \ of droughts \nor floods.\n4.2.3  Water Management\nThe intelligent smart watering\
    \ system proposed by Munir \net al., [135] is a blockchain-based system for the\
    \ smart \nconsumption of water. The system uses IoT for capturing \nreal-time\
    \ environment conditions such as soil moisture \nlevel, light intensity, air humidity,\
    \ and air temperature. The \nmain focus of the proposed system was to develop\
    \ a healthy \necosystem while efficiently using water in plantations and \ngardening.\
    \ Forbye, A water control system to efficiently \nmanage and coordinate the use\
    \ of water in irrigation com-\nmunities is proposed by Bordel et al., [136]. The\
    \ prosumer \nenvironment in the model is composed of a rule definition \nmodule\
    \ where users can create irrigation recipes using ECA \n(Event-Condition-Action)\
    \ rules. These rules are executable \nand easily transformed into other programming\
    \ languages. \nInputs are taken by a transformation engine, to create, com-\n\
    pile, and deploy a set of Smart Contracts coding all the irri-\ngation and management\
    \ logic. Finally, irrigation recipes are \nexecuted by an execution engine, which\
    \ invokes deployed \nSmart Contracts to interact with the infrastructure. From\
    \ \nthe perspective of Dogo et al., [137] proposed convergence \nof IoT and Blockchain.\
    \ Objectives of smart water solutions \ninclude smart measuring and monitoring\
    \ across the water \ndistribution, enhanced security, better analysis of the gener-\n\
    ated data, and enhanced revenue and efficiency.\nSimilarly, Hassija et al., [138]\
    \ proposed a drone-mounted \nbase station in the tactile internet environment\
    \ based on \nblockchain. The drone-mounted small cell station was based \non a\
    \ Permissioned peer-to-peer blockchain. To take strategic \ndecisions, a game\
    \ theory model was deployed. The deci-\nsion was based on user association; transmit\
    \ power level, \ndrone speed, and altitude. Additionally, smart contracts can\
    \ \nadd parameters and conditions based on requirements. The \nmodel’s results\
    \ showed that the low network areas can expe-\nrience better bandwidth with the\
    \ proposed system.\nFurther, the proposed model by Pincheira et al., [139] pre-\n\
    sented a trustless water management system-based software \narchitecture. The\
    \ system proposed presented a decentralized \nwater management system that could\
    \ incentivize virtuous \nbehavior in agricultural practices. Smart contracts were\
    \ used \nfor their intermediary-less characteristic. The authors also \nimplemented\
    \ a cross-platform software library to allow con-\nstrained devices to interact\

    Enescu et al., [140] proposed a study on the use of photovol-\ntaic energy. The\
    \ paper showed the use of photovoltaic panels \nto power a power plant for the\
    \ improvement of abandoned \nland. According to the authors, photovoltaic panels\
    \ can eas-\nily pump water and is a more appropriate use of solar energy. \nBlockchain\
    \ can help reduce the intermediary distributors \nhence making the selling and\
    \ buying of energy more profit-\nable. Additionally, Kulkarni and Kulkarni, [141],\
    \ consider-\ning the lack of electricity in rural India, proposed a model to \n\
    solve rural electrification problems. The model introduces \npeer-to-peer energy\
    \ trading through blockchain suitable for \nsmall and remote micro-grids. A reliable\
    \ and profitable elec-\ntricity supply can be obtained through micro-grids. Smart\
    \ \ncontract-based meters allow transparency in the daily usage \nof energy used\

    4.4  Banking\nIn the banking sector, most of the solutions were about \nissues\
    \ in banking availability in rural areas, loan sanctions \nto under-documented\
    \ people, and methods of transferring \nmoney (Fig. 17). A detailed summary is\
    \ given in Table 10.\n4.4.1  Loan\nGuo et al., [151] proposed a novel poverty\
    \ alleviation loan \nmanagement called the Loan On Blockchain (LoC). In the \n\
    LoC, the participating roles can be named as the Financial \ndepartment to check\
    \ the identity and application informa-\ntion of the participants, bank to provide\
    \ loan to the cus-\ntomer, Customer to provide identity and apply for loan, civil\
    \ \naffairs department to audit the customer identity and loan \napplications,\
    \ Regulator to monitor fund flow and inspect \nledger. This digital account model\
    \ was proposed for decen-\ntralized and centralized transfer of assets. Similarly,\
    \ Jain \net al., [152] presented a solution named Bit-score for credit \nscoring\
    \ for underprivileged (rural) people with the help of \nblockchain. The authors’\
    \ model used a self-sovereign model \nfor identity, distributed ledger storage,\
    \ credit score calcula-\ntion without any extra charges, and non-financial factor\
    \ for \nacquiring credit score. With bit-score being an improvisation \nover traditional\
    \ credit scoring techniques it makes the \ntransactions more transparent, decentralized,\
    \ secure, and \nintermediary-free.\n4.4.2  Mobile Money\nY. Hu, [150] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based digital payment \nsystem to deliver reliable services on\
    \ unreliable network \nservices in rural areas. The system management contract\
    \ \nto record account types, user balances to avoid forks dur-\ning disconnection\
    \ with the help of smart contracts. True \ntransparency can be obtained through\
    \ digitization and eco-\nnomic growth can be boosted in poor countries. Ghatpande\
    \ \net al., [149] proposed a way of moving Secure, interoperable \nmobile money\
    \ in sub-Saharan Africa (SIGMMA) to sup-\nport semi-offline payments through blockchain.\
    \ The model \nprovides unreachable areas a monetary transaction solution \nwithout\
    \ having to provide any identity proof while ensuring \ntrust between parties\
    \ along with not having to physically \nvisit any bank.\n4.4.3  Cash Transfer\n\
    Another proposal is to provide banking solutions to rural \nareas where a chit\
    \ fund system has been designed by Kumar \nand Sangal, [154]. Chit fund being\
    \ a traditional saving \nscheme in India is an easier way to have access to credit.\
    \ The \npurpose of this system is to remove geographical barriers \nFig. 18  Blockchain\

    \ Unlike other anonymous blockchain applica-\ntions, this system requires identity\
    \ registration. Unlike tradi-\ntional co-lateral systems, blockchain generates\
    \ credit history \nto prohibit manipulation. Lastly, Jaffer et al., [153] proposed\
    \ \na blockchain-based distributed system that is immutable and \nsecures the\
    \ transaction logs. The self-executing smart con-\ntracts were used to automatically\
    \ execute real-world con-\ntracts for auto disbursement of subsidies on meeting\
    \ spe-\ncific conditions. This system overcoming traditional cash \ntransfers,\
    \ and corruption and manipulation related to it can \nbenefit rural or deserving\
    \ people.\n4.5  Healthcare\nIn the healthcare sector, smart healthcare systems,\
    \ telemedi-\ncine, and privacy in medical data sharing to provide security \n\
    and transparency in the healthcare system between doctors \nand patients were\
    \ the commonly addressed areas in related \nwork (Fig. 18). A detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 11.\n4.5.1  Medical Data\nKaur et al., [157] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ electronic \nmedical record storage and management system. The pro-\nposed model\
    \ consisted of three main components: Domain \nexperts (doctors, lab technicians,\
    \ pharmacists, and drug \nmanufacturers), health insurance providers, and patients.\
    \ To \nensure the privacy of medical data which contains most of \nthe private\
    \ information blockchain distributed data storage \nfor heterogeneous data was\
    \ proposed having a single source \nfor data storage and access while providing\
    \ high security \nand privacy to the users and researchers. Similarly, Zhang \n\
    et al., [158] proposed secure and scalable clinical data shar-\ning using FHIR\
    \ Chain, a blockchain-based system meeting \nONC (office of the national coordinator\
    \ for health informa-\ntion technology) requirements. The technical requirements\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based clinical data sharing were verifying \nidentity and authenticating\
    \ all participants, Storing and \nexchanging data securely, consistent Permissioned\
    \ access \nto data sources, applying consistent data formats, maintain-\ning modularity.\
    \ FHIRChain facilitates clinical data exchange \nwhile maintaining ownership.\n\
    4.5.2  Telemedicine\nGuo et al., [161] proposed an ABE scheme to achieve \ndynamic\
    \ authentication and authorization with higher flex-\nibility and efficiency for\
    \ the Medical on Demand services \nin the telemedicine system. The system uses\
    \ a Consor-\ntium Blockchain managed by multiple authorities. Medi-\ncal examinations\
    \ are uploaded to the database provided \nby Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The\
    \ medical results are \ndownloadable from Cloud only by Medical specialists. All\
    \ \nthe data is stored in Blocks of Blockchain hence prevent-\ning any manipulation\
    \ in health records. Through this system \nindependence of choice should be provided\
    \ to the patient \nwhether they want to enroll, leave, or change access poli-\n\
    cies. Nusrat et al., [160] proposed a model of a telemedicine \nsystem for medical\
    \ care and security of data of rural people \nby using blockchain technology.\
    \ The system consisted of sta-\ntions for primary treatment tests while storing\
    \ data directly \nin the blockchain. This system ensured communication and \n\
    data privacy to doctors and patients while also giving reli-\nable medical care\
    \ and benefits to underserved (rural) people.\nForbye, Yong et al., [159] have\
    \ proposed a blockchain \nand machine learning system for vaccine supply chain\
    \ trace-\nability. The novel intelligent system based on the blockchain \ncan\
    \ be used for vaccine supervision in the vaccine supply \nchain. Additionally,\
    \ using smart contracts for the vaccine \nsupply chain can provide the following\
    \ advantages: detection \nof expired vaccines, vaccine information, and vaccine\
    \ coin.\n4.5.3  Smart Healthcare System\nMachine Learning holds the power to change\
    \ the perception \nof understanding and analyzing data and decision-making in\
    \ \nmultifarious sectors. Since, the blockchain with its decen-\ntralized network\
    \ focus on secure data sharing, its integration \nwith machine learning would\
    \ provide a very meticulous out-\ncome. Few of the ways through which blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with machine learning and benefit the healthcare system \nare\
    \ [162]:\n(a) Blockchain ledger with legitimate data collection can \nfeed the\
    \ machine learning models with highly accurate \nand dependable data.\n(b) Real\
    \ data can be used to train machine learning models \nto increase efficiency and\
    \ precision, therefore, saving \ncost and time.\n(c) Models can be trained to\
    \ give the same health advice \nto multiple patients with alike symptoms.\n(d)\
    \ Models can also be trained to give better clinical solu-\ntions to doctors based\
    \ on the patient’s symptoms.\n(e) Training the models on the patient history and\
    \ storing \nthem on blockchain ledger can predict outbreaks.\nFor implementing\
    \ the integration, Jain et al., [156] pro-\nposed an integrated model of blockchain\
    \ and machine learn-\ning to detect diseases. These models can be implemented\
    \ \nin a hospital or rural medical camps. The proposed system \nconsisted of IoT,\
    \ blockchain, cybersecurity, and machine \nlearning. Various components measure\
    \ basic parameters of \nthe human body such as weight, pulse, blood pressure,\
    \ and \nautomatically saved the data in the ledger. The system has \nthe potential\
    \ to expand medical parameters while making it \n2456\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\nadaptive. The complete system can collect, store, and ana-\nlyze the\
    \ data of the patient and benefit the doctors, patients, \nand medical institutions.\n\
    Similarly, Tripathi et al., [155] have proposed a safe and \nconvenient use of\
    \ medical data and its user through block-\nchain technology. The proposed work\
    \ is an improvement \non issues and challenges faced regarding security and pri-\n\
    vacy. The clinical data are recorded in the blockchain ledger \nwith access to\
    \ legitimate users only. For a doctor to access \na patient’s data a request has\
    \ to be made and only when \nthe patient approves the request does the data become\
    \ vis-\nible. The goal of this model is to provide secure and reliable \nservices\
    \ to insurance companies, drug supply chains, and \nmedical researchers. Lastly.\n\
    4.6  Employment\nThis application area mainly focused on employment vis-\nibility\
    \ and temporary employment for rural job security \n(Fig. 19). Therefore, the\
    \ following related research articles \nwere identified and a detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 12.\n4.6.1  Temporary Employment\nPinna and Ibba, [163] proposed\
    \ a decentralized employment \nsystem to process employment contracts with a fully\
    \ auto-\nmated and fast procedure. The model consists of a new job \noffer event\
    \ in which awaiting employers apply for jobs, an \napplication event where a smart\
    \ contract acquires the appli-\ncation request, a hiring event where the applicant\
    \ worker \nmeets the employer, a relationship event to enable the work-\ners to\
    \ check working situation and details, the workday event \nwhich describes the\
    \ maturation of workdays, a payment \nevent where the employee gets paid. The\
    \ transparent ledger \ncan make sure that the employment contracts were deployed\
    \ \nwith unchangeable information.\n4.6.2  Employment Visibility\nSimilarly, the\
    \ paper’s proposal by M. et al., [164] ensures \nsupply chain visibility to seamlessly\
    \ connect all stakeholders \nof the supply chain network who are a part of the\
    \ Blockchain \necosystem. The paper defined two modules in BC design: the \nSupply\
    \ module and the demand module. Supply module to \ncollect worker's data and smart\
    \ contracts to perform transac-\ntions through an application interface and store\
    \ them on the \nledger. Demand module to implement job allocation. The \naggregators\
    \ are given direct access to help track worker’s \ninformation from the ledger.\n\
    4.7  Existing Systematic Literature Reviews\nA tabular representation of a few\
    \ major existing works of \nblockchain in rural development has been done in Table 13.\
    \ \nThis table communicates the area of literature reviews, and \ntheir main contributions\
    \ in the review regarding blockchain \nin rural or agriculture.\nAn extensive\
    \ literature review was done in this section \nwhich portrayed the enormous amount\
    \ of work done in \nblockchain technology pertaining to rural development. All\
    \ \nthe functional areas and sub-areas were compared and dis-\ncussed in tabular\
    \ form. Multiple novel ideas and theories \nwere identified during the literature\
    \ review. At last, a small \ntabular representation was made for the existing\
    \ systematic \nliterature reviews and surveys in a similar area to identify the\
    \ \ndepth of the work done. In the upcoming sections, critical \nanalysis and\
    \ detailed discussion have been done based on \nthe literature study, followed\
    \ by the limitations of the survey \nand conclusion.\nFig. 19  Blockchain applications\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n5  Critical Analysis Existing Technologies \nand Discussion\n\
    Blockchain Technology possesses much competence and \nfuturistic hold towards\
    \ rural development. In this review, \nall possible applications of blockchain\
    \ that facilitated rural \ndevelopment were found, reviewed, compared, and summa-\n\
    rized. With Agriculture being the predominant application \nof blockchain, various\
    \ areas under it were analyzed that \nworked on the relief of agricultural issues\
    \ in rural areas.\nStarting with Supply chain traceability, the study showed \n\
    integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things \n[51, 54, 56, 58,\
    \ 63, 64, 69, 70, 73, 76, 82, 84, 85, 89, 100, \n145], Cloud computing [65, 87],\
    \ Big Data [87], and Geo-\nspatial Technology [100]. Among the papers discussed,\
    \ this \narea consisted of papers pertinent to tracing agricultural \nproduce\
    \ from the beginning of the process till it reached \nthe consumer. The range\
    \ of traceability options comprised \nall agricultural products as well as specifically\
    \ certain prod-\nucts such as soybean [60], grape wine [69], and cocoa beans \n\
    [62]. Furthermore, blockchain’s integration with IoT pro-\nvided sensing and sharing\
    \ of private data with blockchain \nwithout intermediary support. Additionally,\
    \ some proposed \nwork used QR codes [56, 60, 146] for viewing data directly \n\
    related to the attached product. Articles supporting IoT \ndevices were implemented\
    \ for tracing agricultural produce, \nencouraging circular economy, fault-tolerant,\
    \ and immutable \nAPIs. A few were reviews on agriculture traceability [53, \n\
    58, 60, 61] barriers [67], challenges [59, 71, 76] contribu-\ntion [80], IoT based\
    \ solutions, and future scopes [78, 96]. \nSome agricultural prototypes included\
    \ AgriBlockIoT [70], \nKHET [83], and FARMAR [68]. A few land record manage-\n\
    ment articles were also discussed that implied security and \nbroker-free methods\
    \ for land titling and transferring [97, 98]. \nMost of the platforms used were\
    \ Ethereum Smart Contracts, \nHyperledger, REST, JavaScript (Web3, node, angular),\
    \ Truf-\nfle Framework APIs, and MySQL and MongoDB for cloud \nstorage.\nWhile\
    \ traceability of agricultural produce is important, \nthe agriculture security\
    \ system is also a necessity. In this \nreview, the articles for agriculture security\
    \ systems included \nprevention of farm data from cyber-attacks using IoT [103]\
    \ \nand supervision of agricultural products and food informa-\ntion [102]. In\
    \ both the works acquired, it used Smart con-\ntracts and Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ respectively, along with \nIoT-based sensors for farm monitoring.\nOrganic Farming\
    \ as a part of agriculture application for \nsustainable farming and quality food\
    \ production included \ntwo articles for analyzing the effectiveness of supply\
    \ chain \n[101], and identifying product quality and transparency of \norganic\
    \ food supply chain using decentralized applications \nand QR codes for tracing\
    \ product data [104].\nTable 12  Comparison of blockchain applications in Employment\n\

    Furthermore, using smart methods to enhance the agri-\ncultural process was discusses\
    \ in the smart agriculture \nSect. 3.1.4 where farm controlling, recordkeeping,\
    \ improved \nlogistics, farm managing and improvising, and monitoring \nusing\
    \ Blockchain Technology and IoT [106–110] as well \nas cloud computing [105] and\
    \ geospatial technology [100] \nin some articles were covered. Most emphases were\
    \ given \ntowards improving the quality of farming and its man-\nagement while\
    \ providing utmost security to data. Mostly \nused platforms to implement the\
    \ proposed work were \nJavaScript(Node, Ganache, Truffle), Ethereum Smart Con-\n\
    tracts, and IoT-based sensors.\nApart from the supply chain in farming, the dairy\
    \ sector \nwas one of the application areas covered in the review com-\nprising\
    \ of E-governance in the dairy sector implemented on \nsmart contracts [111],\
    \ and quality and quantity assurance \nof milk with a delivery platform [112]\
    \ using Blockchain \nTechnology. In addition to the dairy sector, blockchain appli-\n\
    cations in livestock management using Blockchain Technol-\nogy [114], IoT and\
    \ Cloud Computing [113, 115, 147] to \nmonitor livestock, observe cattle using\
    \ RFID tags, storing \ndetailed information on fishes, along with livestock trace-\n\
    ability were discussed in the review. Integration with IoT \nprovided real-time\
    \ monitoring and traceability of livestock \nand its by-products in the supply\
    \ chain.\nSimilarly, to share informative farming data and tech-\nniques a review\
    \ on convenience analysis of the blockchain \nin agriculture [116], and exploratory\
    \ data planning and \nmanagement of agricultural food supply chain for sustain-\n\
    able development [117] was given to explore the work done \nin E-agriculture using\
    \ blockchain technology. Since one \nof the main motives towards implementing\
    \ blockchain in \nagriculture is to monitor the faring process and products \n\
    till it reaches the consumer, therefore, agriculture monitor-\ning section covered\
    \ farm monitoring system[99], a yield \nestimation system to share farming plans\
    \ implemented on \nsmart contracts [119], and an IoT based AG Wallet system to\
    \ \ntrack farm activity implemented using IBM enterprise block-\nchain platform\
    \ [118]. Penultimately, the application area was \ndivided into farmer Sect. 3.1.9\
    \ where blockchain’s reviews \nto facilitate farmers such as farmer’s portal to\
    \ capture farm \nactivities using HTML and Python [121], farmer’s data stor-\n\
    age to provide transparency for government scheme using \nsmart contracts [120],\
    \ and farmer’s data accessing using \ntheir consent [122] were discussed.\nLastly,\
    \ an overall blockchain application area covering the \nuse of incentives for\
    \ numerous activities was discussed in \nSect. 3.1.10. The review included a reward-based\
    \ system in \nreturn for solid waste [148], rural waste [128], anonymously \n\
    reporting an activity [130], reporting an accident [127], stor-\ning educational\
    \ records in ledger [132], green behavior [123, \n124], geotagging litters [125],\
    \ and to safely share medical \ndata [126]. The incentive mechanism works when\
    \ an activ-\nity is performed, therefore in return for good behaviors or \nactivity,\
    \ cryptocurrency-based tokens are rewarded that can \nbe stored in a blockchain\
    \ wallet. Most of the platforms used \nwere smart contracts while some of the\
    \ systems also used \nARK Blockchain, Laravel PHP, and JavaScript.\nLooking through\
    \ the applications of blockchain in rural \nareas, usage of blockchain in reinforcing\
    \ environmental \nconditions and changing people's outlook on preserving the \n\
    environment was the outcome of factors affecting rural peo-\nple as they were\
    \ much likely also related to environmental \nconditions. From this view, the\
    \ environmental application \nareas were discovered and discussed to be Water\
    \ manage-\nment, Waste management, and Natural hazards.\nTo begin with, under\
    \ Sect. 3.2.3 water management, \nsmart measuring and monitoring [137], smart\
    \ consump-\ntion [135], management [139], and control system [136] \nof water\

    \ credibility system of biomass energy grid [143], \nand a case study of sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa and its challenges \nand adoption of renewable energy access were discussed\
    \ \n[142]. Whereas in the energy grid section, the blockchain’s \napplication\
    \ in providing peer-to-peer electrification with \nsecure payments, transparent\
    \ energy usage [144], and the \nuse of smart energy grids for farming and irrigation\
    \ using \nEthereum Blockchain [140] were reviewed.\nBesides, from the traditional\
    \ use of blockchain in Finance, \nthe banking solutions for rural people were\
    \ discussed in \nSect. 3.4. From the banking applications of blockchain, the \n\
    use of mobile money for semi-offline payments in sub-Saha-\nran Africa without\
    \ identity proof using a secure, interoper-\nable mobile money system [149], and\
    \ a delay-tolerant digital \npayment system based on Ethereum blockchain [150]\
    \ were \ndiscussed. A simpler way of getting a loan with the help \nof blockchain\
    \ is by using a hyper ledger fabric-based Loan \nOn Blockchain(LOC) system using\
    \ smart contracts [151], \nand a credit scoring system called Bit-score using\
    \ Ethereum \nBlockchain [152] were discussed. Finally, a Cash Transfer \narea\
    \ where a distributed system for automatic subsidy deliv-\nery and fund release\
    \ using JavaScript and Hyperledger com-\nposer [153], and a chit fund system based\
    \ on smart contracts \nto provide credit to rural people [154] were reviewed.\n\
    Under the Healthcare applications of blockchain, A Smart \nHealthcare System,\
    \ Medical Data sharing, and Telemedi-\ncine were the areas discovered. Under smart\
    \ healthcare, the \narticles reviewed were a smart model to detect diseases and\
    \ \nmeasure basic health parameters using Ethereum blockchain \nand Raspberry\
    \ Pi [156] and protected access to medical \ndata using smart contracts [155].\
    \ For the recordkeeping of \nmedical data and share it legitimately an electronic\
    \ medi-\ncal record storage management system based on ethereum \nand cloud storage\
    \ [157], and a permissioned clinical data \nsharing called FHIRChain using smart\
    \ contracts [158] was \nreviewed. Lastly, under Telemedicine, vaccine supervision\
    \ \nand traceability for safe vaccine supply [159], secure data \nstorage using\
    \ telemedicine system based on smart contracts \n[160], and a telemedicine system\
    \ to prevent health records \nmanipulation using Blockchain and Cloud Database\
    \ [161] \nwere the articles reviewed.\nAnother challenge faced by rural people\
    \ implemented to \nrecuperate from unemployment using blockchain technol-\nogy\
    \ was discussed in Sect. 3.6. Using smart contracts an \nemployment contracts\
    \ processing, handling, and safe pay-\nment system for temporary employment contracts\
    \ [163], and \na blockchain aggregator to perform worker data transactions \n\
    and employment visibility [164] were the works reviewed \nin this section.\n5.1\
    \  Limitations of Existing Works and Research \nGaps\nIn this section, the limitations\
    \ of the existing literature \nreview on blockchain in rural development along\
    \ with \na comparison of existing systematic literature reviews \nhave been discussed.\
    \ The comparison has been shown in \nTable 14, and a few research gaps have been\
    \ mentioned in \nthis section as well.\nWhile Blockchain technology is leading\
    \ in security and \ntransparency, providing ways of applying its technology in\
    \ \ndisparate areas its limitations and gaps can still be identi-\nfied in the\
    \ proposed and implemented work. While most \nof the work in agriculture is for\
    \ ensuring transparency and \ntraceability in the supply chain, there are far\
    \ more factors in \nagriculture that affect farmers and crops. Blockchain inevi-\n\
    tably uses excessive energy in execution, but its execution in \nrural areas may\
    \ become worrisome due to the lack of energy \nand load in those areas.\nCollecting\
    \ farm data and storing them on the ledger in \nsmall farms is easier. However,\
    \ in the case of big farms, the \ndata collection and integration may consume\
    \ much time and \nprobably manpower in accumulating and loading it in the \nledger.\
    \ Apart from that, IoT-based services require sensors \nas well as collecting\
    \ livestock DNA to trace them and load \ntheir information may cost a fortune\
    \ to small-scale farmers.\nTeaching the application usage to laymen, that too\
    \ unedu-\ncated farmers or rural people may become a troubling task. \nNot only\
    \ that, the availability of news of the latest technolo-\ngies is hardly accessible\
    \ to underdeveloped countries, intro-\nducing blockchain-based applications to\
    \ those areas may toil \nthe deployment and utilization.\n2460\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\

    \ while \nmaking blockchain transactions. A lost private key or a mis-\ntakenly\
    \ added extra digit to the payment can cause irrevers-\nible damage.\nThereafter,\
    \ a data breach of medical data and inappro-\npriate access to medical histories\
    \ are some issues that may \ndecrease people’s trust in the blockchain-based healthcare\
    \ \nsystem for medical data privacy.\nSecurity threat is another limitation that\
    \ can affect any \ntype of application that requires recordkeeping. Here the \n\
    blockchain’s main characteristics may itself prove faulty to \nfind the intruder\
    \ as it gives total anonymity to users. With \nboth pros and cons, robust and\
    \ reliable technology can still \nbe deployed for many usages, making livability\
    \ easier and \npeople technologically advanced.\n5.2  Discussion\nMultiple issues\
    \ pertaining to rural areas have been addressed \nby authors with the help of\
    \ blockchain. Agriculture is the \nmost economic factor, solutions for blockchain-based\
    \ sup-\nply chain traceability provided secure, transparent, beneficial \nproduct\
    \ delivery. It also ensured timely payments to farm-\ners and quality products\
    \ to consumers. Banking solutions \nhave also been made easier with blockchain\
    \ technology, pro-\nviding remote banking solutions, credit and loan easiness,\
    \ \nand easy and transparent banking. Hygiene issues that led \nto many diseases,\
    \ generational disabilities have also been \ngiven a solution through blockchain\
    \ which also incentivizes \nrural people for participating in waste and water\
    \ manage-\nment. Rural electrification solutions were also proposed with \nblockchain\
    \ for people unable to obtain energy resources, \nbasic electrical amenities,\
    \ and expensive bills. People who \nwere unable to receive treatments, had to\
    \ travel long dis-\ntances for medical assistance, were also provided a block-\n\
    chain solution with which telemedicine, privacy to medical \ndata usage, and medical-on-demand\
    \ were made available. \nBlockchain has also been useful in providing employment\
    \ \nsolutions to the truly underserved, using a global chain \nfor employment\
    \ visibility, and secure payment for jobs \n[168–172].\nThe Systematic Literature\
    \ Review’s objective is to pro-\nvide information on the research proposed related\
    \ to block-\nchain in rural development to provide new research oppor-\ntunities,\
    \ extensive knowledge about each development area, \nand the possibility for future\
    \ development in rural areas. \nAfter distinctly reviewing every research article\
    \ variant areas \nof applications were identified relating to the development\
    \ of \nFig. 20  Blockchain Applications and their Areas in rural development\n\
    2462\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nrural areas with the help of Blockchain Technology.\
    \ Overall, \n6 disparate applications in rural development were picked \nout;\
    \ from which each of these applications has a total of 23 \ndivergent areas combined.\
    \ These areas contribute to all the \nresearch that has been done in the blockchain\
    \ in the rural \ndevelopment sector and are distributed across 37 countries \n\
    obtained from 6 journals and 1 web source ranging from \nthe years 2010 to 2020.\
    \ After searching through journals, \napplying more than 16 keywords, 112 articles\
    \ were found in \naggregate. From analyzing each article, the primary applica-\n\
    tion of blockchain was identified as agriculture with 67% of \nresearch articles\
    \ relative to blockchain in agriculture whence \n60% were associated with supply\
    \ chain traceability. About \n55% of those papers were from the Institute of Electrical\
    \ and \nElectronics Engineers (IEEE). Furthermore, in 112 research \npapers, 8\
    \ technologies were implemented with a total of 58 \nplatforms and tools combined.\n\
    5.3  Research Questions Addressed\nFrom the Research Questions defined (Table 3),\
    \ the follow-\ning inference can be made:\nRQ1 What are the main applications\
    \ and areas of imple-\nmenting Blockchain Technology in Rural Development?\nVarious\
    \ extensively researched applications are defined \nin Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\
    \ 11 and 12. These applications \ndefine the Blockchain’s applications in rural\
    \ development \nthat impact the rural areas, provide security, opportunities,\
    \ \navailability of resources, and a better lifestyle. The areas \n(Fig. 20) gave\
    \ extensive knowledge about the domains of \napplication-defined from several\
    \ research articles related to \nit.\nRQ2 What are the major issues in Rural Development\
    \ and \nhow they can be addressed using Blockchain Technology?\nNumerous issues\
    \ in rural areas are explained in Sect. 1.1.1 \nand the blockchain applications\
    \ for the eradication of those \nissues are addressed in Sect. 3.\nRQ3 What are\
    \ the targeted software, platforms, and tools \nfor the implementation of blockchain\
    \ in rural development?\nThroughout the applications, for implementation follow-\n\
    ing (Table 15) technologies’ integration, and software and \nplatforms were used:\n\
    RQ4.  What are the research gaps and future research direc-\ntions for applying\
    \ blockchain technology to rural \ndevelopment?\nFollowing the review, in agriculture,\
    \ most emphases were \nstated towards supply chain traceability and less or no\
    \ work \nin natural resource management, overproduction, yield stag-\nnation,\
    \ and international trade. In regards to the sociological \nfactor, research on\
    \ work belonging to blockchain develop-\nment for rural education, housing, women\
    \ empowerment, \ncrime reduction, brain drain, and craftsmanship is missing. \n\
    For the implementation of banking, healthcare, and many \nother applications the\
    \ required government and technologi-\ncal assist are still lacking. In some cases,\
    \ the research pro-\nposed could be administered only in the far future, therefore\
    \ \ncontemporary work was absent. Some more gaps and future \nresearch directions\
    \ are given in Sects. 4.2 and 6.1.\nThe research questions mentioned in Table \
    \ 3 are \naddressed in the following section (Table 16):\n6  Threat to Validity\
    \ and Limitation \nof the Survey\nWhile reviewing the issues in rural areas, blockchain\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n2.3. During exclusion, some articles were not considered\
    \ fit \nfor this review, were missed, or were not found. Six appli-\ncations were\
    \ considered in this review, there could be more \napplications that we couldn’t\
    \ figure or that couldn’t make the \ncut of criteria. A total of 23 sub-areas\
    \ of all the applications \nwere determined. Conclusively, as per our knowledge,\
    \ there \nwasn’t any systematic review that reviewed all the applica-\ntion areas\
    \ of blockchain technology in rural and sustainable \ndevelopment nevertheless\
    \ there could have been a few rural \nand sustainable development articles that\
    \ weren’t included \nin this review.\n7  Conclusion and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ Technology has presented a considerable amount \nof work in the rural sector.\
    \ While its implementation was \nfew, the ideology is enough to motivate people\
    \ into changing \nthe lifestyle of rural people leading to the overall country’s\
    \ \ndevelopment. In this systematic literature review, numerous \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology in sustainable rural \ndevelopment were discussed with\
    \ diverse areas in each \napplication. A comparative study of each application\
    \ in all \nthe areas pertaining to different approaches has been por-\ntrayed\
    \ with differing attributes elucidating the technology, \nprocess, and techniques\
    \ behind each article. The paper pro-\nvides extensive literature towards each\
    \ of the articles sorted \nafter applying the review process consisting of relevant\
    \ arti-\ncles and keywords. The primary findings of the systematic \nliterature\
    \ review were as follows:\n(a) From the review, we were able to identify common\
    \ and \nexceptional uses of blockchain technology that would \nhelp uplift the\
    \ rural community and lead to sustainable \nrural development.\n(b) Various distinct\
    \ approaches to implementing block-\nchain technology for rural welfare were discovered.\n\
    (c) Platforms and tools that would facilitate the use of these \napplications\
    \ for farmers and uninstructed agrestic peo-\nple were identified and reviewed.\n\
    (d) Blockchain’s integration with multiple powerful tech-\nnologies for rural\
    \ development was reviewed.\n(e) An overall idea for a collaborative approach\
    \ leading to \na smart village framework was constructed.\nThe gaps determined\
    \ from reviewing the articles broadly \nwould help researchers explore additional\
    \ as well as alter-\nnative utilization of blockchain technology for sustainable\
    \ \nrural development.\n7.1  Future Work\nBlockchain’s characteristics are exceptionally\
    \ conducive to \nsafety, privacy, integrity, traceability, efficiency, and trans-\n\
    parency in every area limited by such advantages. While \ndiverse blockchain applications\
    \ for the welfare of rural \ncommunity has been discussed nevertheless future\
    \ work \ncan comprise of facilitating applications in making use of \nblockchain\
    \ incentives for a collaborative framework incor-\nporating several services in\
    \ rural areas namely Smart Vil-\nlage. Blockchain technology in terms of providing\
    \ incentive \nmechanisms could lead to a better motivational unit in many \nareas.\
    \ Incentivizing rural or urban people for education, data \nsharing, green farming,\
    \ green behavior, and environment \nconservation are real future demands. Apart\
    \ from empha-\nsizing rural areas, blockchain’s integration with network-\ning,\
    \ cybersecurity, and digital advertising is also a future \ninsistence.\nFunding\

    in technology has caused an explosion in the number of devices connected to the
    Internet. Intel is projecting that the number of connected devices would reach
    200 billion by 2020 from the 2 billion devices in 2006 [1]. Also, according to
    Business Insiders, it is predicted that by 2020, 75% of vehicles will come with
    built-in Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity [2]. Therefore, with the unprecedented
    growth in the number of devices connected to the Internet, i.e., IoT, more and
    more challenges are emerging everyday. Nowadays, IoT applications are seen everywhere.
    In the last few years, many new terms associated with IoT has popped up, such
    as, but not limited to, smart health, smart cities, smart homes, smart transportation,
    smart agriculture and smart industry. Hence, the deployment of IoT systems will
    provide significant savings and revenues in many areas, in particular in providing
    monitoring and maintenance solutions. Therefore, this growth has forced businesses
    to adopt different strategies to cope with this exponential growth and the challenges
    associated with them, such as allocating sufficient spectrum bands in IoT applications.
    That includes transmission performance degeneration, spectrum scarcity, spectrum
    sharing, interference among devices, etc. Recently, the adaptation of Cognitive
    Radio Networks (CRNs) in IoT has shown equivalent or better performance than currently
    used networks such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, Bluetooth, etc. Hence, opportunistic approaches
    for Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum control and management to optimize the scare
    spectrum resources is emerging as one of the main challenges. With the recent
    unprecedented increase of wireless communication systems, applications and their
    users limits spectrum resources and make connectivity between their interconnected
    objects a crucial task. Therefore, the demands for smart devices that can manage
    and configure its transmission parameters based on the spectrum availability in
    spatio-temporal dimensions are remarkably increased. Cognitive Radio (CR) is the
    best candidate technology; it is defined as an adaptive, intelligent radio and
    network technology that automatically detects available channels in a wireless
    spectrum and changes transmission parameters enabling more communications to run
    concurrently and also improves radio operating behavior [3]. The benefits of CR
    systems would be to [4]: relieve spectrum scarcity by broadcasting on unused spectrum
    and avoiding interference with primary licensee, avoid radio jamming and interference
    based on the selected Spectrum Sensing (SS) approach, support switch to power
    saving protocol, improve communication quality by using higher bandwidth services,
    and improve Quality of Service (QoS), since the availability, suitability and
    reliability will be enhanced. New spectrum resources can be gained by allowing
    non-licensee users, i. e., Secondary Users (SUs), to share a licensee users, i.e.,
    Primary User (PU), bands such that PUs should be always protected from SUs interference.
    Therefore, CR users must consider protecting the PUs over any other interest.
    There are three CR paradigms (i.e., schemes) by which a SU can share a PU’s spectrum
    band, these are: overlay, underlay and interweave. For overlay and underlay schemes,
    a SU can coexist with the PU without interference or with a minimum interference,
    since in underlay scheme transmission power of the SU should never exceed some
    limit, while in overlay scheme there is no such constraint; however, the SU should
    have a full knowledge about the PU’s signal, so that the SU can generate an orthogonal
    signal to the PU’s signal to eliminate interference. In the interweave scheme,
    a SU is allowed to transmit if and only if a PU is not utilizing its spectrum
    band; nevertheless, if the PU resumes its activity, the SU should leave the spectrum
    band by either switching to another band or by ceasing its activity if no vacancy
    exists. The CR works through a cognition cycle with four functional phases which
    are sensing, decision, sharing, and mobility. The cognition cycle begins with
    SS phase through which the available spectrum resources are detected over the
    selected spectrum band using different SS approaches. Based on the detection results,
    the decision is made to concurrently share the band, or to cease transmission
    in that band. Once a CR decides to exploit the band, a proper Medium Access Control
    (MAC) protocol is employed and power allocation should be considered to satisfy
    the PU protection. Finally, switching from band to another is performed through
    the mobility phase. This work initially discusses the main design factors of CR-based
    IoT systems. Moreover, the work reviews the most recent research works related
    to SS and spectrum sharing approaches, classifies the approaches, discusses their
    IoT applications, and introduces the criteria of selecting the most appropriate
    SS approach and MAC protocol for the CR-based IoT system. Furthermore, this work
    reviews and compares the applicable MAC protocols employed in this area. In addition,
    this work discusses the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT
    systems. Finally, this work considers the challenges and possible future research
    directions and open issues. The contributions of this survey paper are: reviewing
    the recent existing works on the field of SS and sharing for CR-based IoT, discussing
    the design factors of CR-based IoT system and its main components, presenting
    and categorizing the SS approaches for IoT applications, identifying the main
    requirements for SS phase for IoT CR networks, developing the selection criteria
    of proper SS and sharing approaches for a proper CR-based IoT applications, discussing
    the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT system, and providing
    the future research directions and challenges. A list of acronyms used throughout
    this paper is provided in Table 1, while the remaining part of this paper is organized
    as follows; Section II describes the recent related works, Section III discusses
    the design factors of CR-based IoT, Section IV presents CR-based IoT design flow,
    Section V discusses the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT
    systems, Section VI addresses some future research directions and open issues,
    and finally, Section VII provides the conclusions. TABLE 1 List of the Acronyms
    and Their Definitions SECTION II. Related Works A limited number of papers surveyed
    CR-based IoT and have discussed this topic from different perspectives. The survey
    in [5] briefly discusses the principle of IoT technology; moreover, it describes
    how CR system works, its applications, and challenges of implementing CR system
    in reality. Despite that the survey mentions the possibility of incorporating
    CR and IoT for smart applications; it does not describe how to achieve this goal
    and challenges that might be faced. The authors in [6] classified IoT technologies
    based on their orientations. Furthermore, they described the types of enabling
    technologies for IoT and discuss the IoT applications. Moreover, the authors explained
    the importance of adding cognitive capabilities to the IoT device for smart purposes.
    In addition, the authors considered the challenges of adopting CR capabilities
    in IoT and the SS paradigms for CR-based IoT. The survey did not cover how to
    incorporate different types of SS approaches and their IoT applications; the benefits
    of employing CRNs for IoT applications were not discussed either. The basis of
    the CR-based IoT is thoroughly explained in [7] where the principles of adopting
    CR in IoT applications were explained, as well as, possible architectures and
    frameworks were described. Moreover, the survey classified the frameworks based
    on features such as context awareness, scalablity, configurability and volume
    of data. The survey also considered real-world scenarios of CR-based IoT systems
    and the challenges that might be faced. Finally, the survey summarized the open
    issues and future research directions for hardware design of CR-based IoT. Despite
    that the survey focused on the CR module and the possibility of employing it for
    adding cognitive capability to IoT devices; the survey did not cover how to share
    vacant spectrum bands and employed MAC protocol, how to select the appropriate
    SS approach and which class of SS (i.e., narrowband or wideband) fits for a specific
    IoT application. On the other hand, the authors in [8] developed a comprehensive
    survey on the employed frameworks for spectrum sharing in CR-based IoT. The survey
    also reviewed the existing schemes of SS and spectrum sharing, the challenges
    and issues that might be encountered in the real world applications. In addition,
    the authors of the survey presented a general architecture with four layers for
    spectrum sharing process in CR-based IoT. The four layers are sensing, spectrum
    allocation, transmission power optimization, and security. However, the authors
    did not focus on the suitability of each SS approach for IoT applications and
    the selection of the proper MAC protocol. Different architectures have been proposed
    to implement IoT systems. The survey in [9] discussed the structure of IoT element
    and provided a thorough analysis of the possible architectures of IoT. Moreover,
    the work in [10] focused on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) IoT which is composed
    of four layers, namely: applications, service, networking and sensing layers.
    A recently published survey in [11] discussed SS approaches in CNRs and addresses
    the recent advances in this technology, its challenges and future research directions.
    The survey presented SS approaches as two main categories, wideband and narrowband.
    Moreover, it discussed many of the available techniques of each category providing
    comparisons in each category as well as applications. The survey was concluded
    by highlighting the open research challenge of tackling attacks targeting secure
    SS and sharing. Nevertheless, all above-mentioned surveys paved the track for
    motivating more research works to tackle those points which were not covered.
    Table 2 summarizes the strong points of each survey paper along with some remarks
    on each. TABLE 2 Remarks on the Published Survey Papers on CR-Based IoT SECTION
    III. Design Factors of CR-Based IoT Systems The main objective of using IoT systems
    is to connect numerous heterogeneous devices and systems together to provide some
    smart services with minimal device resource requirements, i.e., power, hardware
    complexity and cost, i.e., expenses. To achieve this objective, the connectivity
    between devices should always be maintained in all circumstances. This motivates
    us to focus on SS and spectrum sharing processes in CR-based IoT. The designer
    should carefully select a proper SS approach for the CR-based IoT device. Moreover,
    the designer should determine the spectrum band allocation precisely to satisfy
    the PU protection constraints when exploiting the vacant spectrum band. To achieve
    those two goals, the following factors have to be considered: IoT applications.
    Enabling technology. Regulations. Those design factors are used to determine the
    main characteristics of the CR-based IoT system, such as transmission range, transmission
    rate, Bandwidth (BW) occupancy, transmitted signal type, i.e., analog or digital,
    transmission nature, i.e., continuous or intermittent. Based on those characteristics,
    a designer can select the proper SS approach and MAC protocol as discussed in
    Section IV. For example, to design CR-based IoT enabling Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT)
    technology, a designer should select one of the Narrowband Spectrum Sensing (NBSS)
    approaches, such as Energy Detector (ED), Cyclostationary Feature Detector (CFD),
    or Matched Filter (MF). Section IV-A provides more details about selecting the
    proper SS approach. From MAC protocol perspective, standard random MAC protocols,
    such as slotted ALOHA and Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    can be employed in such case [12], [13]. Figure 1 demonstrates the factors to
    be considered for designing a CR-based IoT system. Moreover, the figure shows
    the relationship between the design factors. FIGURE 1. Design factors of CR-based
    IoT system. Show All A. IoT Applications IoT has enormous applications. The applications
    are selected based on the type of the service to be provided. For instance, if
    IoT devices are used for medical purposes; the Wireless Medical Applications (WMA)
    are classified as Medical Implant Communications Services (MICS), Wireless Medical
    Telemetry Service (WMTS), Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), Ultra Wideband
    (UWB), Radar Imaging (RI), and Telehealth [14]. The type of the application determines
    the nature of the signal to be transmitted (i.e., analog or digital), data size,
    time transmission, type of transmission (i.e., intermittent or continuous), frequency
    range and the standards to be employed. As an illustrative example, Table 3 displays
    the transmission requirements of some medical applications. TABLE 3 Transmission
    Parameters and Applicable SS Class for Some Medical Applications All above-mentioned
    medical applications must employ low power device with transmission power constraint
    of ≤ 0.75 mW; so that they do not pose any harm to a human body; moreover, the
    applications are allowed to use some portions of Industrial Scientific Medical
    (ISM) bands [14]. B. Enabling Technology IoT networks employ many different enabling
    technologies for establishing the communication between the devices in the network.
    Radio frequency IDentification (RFID), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Bluetooth,
    WiFi, and Near Field Communication (NFC) are some of enabling technologies that
    IoT might use for communication. The enabling technologies can be classified as
    short range coverage technologies and long range coverage technologies. For instance,
    Bluetooth, RFID and NFC are classified as short range coverage technologies, while
    WSN, and Long Term Evolution (LTE) fall in the class of long range coverage technology.
    Figure 2 shows an illustrative example of IoT network connecting different technologies
    and standards. FIGURE 2. IoT Network with different technologies and standards.
    Show All The enabling technology specifically determines the data rate of the
    shared information, its bandwidth, transmission range, and operating frequency.
    Moreover, the standard and the MAC protocol must be selected to fit the application
    and the enabling technology. C. Regulations Every country has regulatory bodies
    and working groups which are responsible for imposing the regulations of frequency
    usage such as licences, allowable interference, and certificates [22]. Moreover,
    those bodies and groups determine the frequency assignment for licensed and unlicensed
    services and users. As an example, a CR system for e-health applications are allowed
    to operate on either unlicensed or licensed bands. Table 4 provides different
    regulations and applications for IoT adopting RFID technology in different countries.
    However, for some countries, it is important to satisfy an ElectroMagnetic Compliance
    (EMC) requirement. Therefore, certification of adopted wireless IoT device is
    necessary to meet their emission and susceptibility of ElectroMagnetic Interference
    (EMI). Moreover, the adopted standard determines whether the device needs certification
    or not. For instance, wireless medical device in Canada, under Radio Standard
    Specifications RSS-243 requires certification, while RSS 310 exempts those devices
    from certification. TABLE 4 IoT-RFID Parameters for Different Regulations From
    standard perspective, IoT use different standards such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    etc. Each standard is suitable for some applications. The suitability depends
    on the application’s parameters such as data rate, transmission range and whether
    the transmission is continuous or intermittent. Here are some examples: Bluetooth
    and ZigBee are suitable for low data rate applications that need long battery
    life and secured networking. More specifically, ZigBee is suited for intermittent
    transmission with data rate of 250 kbps, and its range reaches 20 m. Wi-Fi is
    suitable for applications with high date rate over Wireless Local Area Network
    (WLAN) platform, and its range reaches 35 to 40 m for indoor and outdoor, respectively.
    Furthermore, it is noticeable nowadays that most of IoT applications uses ISM
    band at 2.4 GHz, where various standards can be facilitated. However, there are
    some wireless IoT applications which employ 5 GHz WiFi and high-band cellular,
    while the low-power-long-range wireless IoT applications can employ TV White Space
    (TVWS), i.e., IEEE 802.22, in the band of 400 MHz to 700 MHz as in the United
    States [25]. In addition to the aforementioned factors; physical specifications
    such as weight, size, and power should also be taken into consideration when designing
    CR-based IoT devices, since the ultimate goal is to design low power constrained
    light weight CR-based IoT device with a compact size. Improving the energy efficiency
    of the devices is a vital research direction in this area, since most of IoT devices
    are battery power terminal with limited lifetime. Charging or replacing batteries
    is not a feasible issue, this fact necessitates determining other alternatives
    to prolong the battery’s lifetime. Energy harvesting techniques are among the
    best alternatives, and many research works have been done in this area [26]–[29].
    SECTION IV. CR-Based IoT System Design Flow Adding cognitive capability to IoT
    device means incorporating CR technology with IoT device, which can be realized
    through designing three consecutive functional phases as illustrated in Fig. 3.
    The functional phases are, namely, SS, spectrum sharing, and spectrum management.
    Details in each functional phase are provided below. FIGURE 3. CR-based IoT system
    design flow. Show All A. Spectrum Sensing Phase In SS component, a designer of
    CR-based IoT system must carefully select the adopted SS approach and the sensing
    decision making technique. This section highlights the selection criteria of SS
    approach and decision techniques. 1) SS Approach Selection The SS process can
    be performed either on narrowband or wideband levels. NBSS implies that the BW
    is lower than the coherence bandwidth. NBSS is performed when there is enough
    information about the PUs’ signal and BW. Many NBSS approaches have been developed
    in literature, including ED [30], [32]–[35], MF detection [31], [35]–[38], eigenvalue-based
    detection [35], [45]–[48], and CFD [35], [39]–[44], etc. Table 5 provides a general
    comparison between the different NBSS approaches. TABLE 5 General Remarks on NBSS
    Approaches In contrast, when the occupancy details of the PUs are unknown to the
    CR, WBSS provides better utilization of the frequency spectrum. However, the design
    and implementation of WBSS approaches are usually complex and consume more energy
    from high-rate Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). Many WBSS approaches have
    been developed in literature, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based detectors
    [49]–[51], filter-based detectors [52]–[54], wavelet detection [55], sequential
    scanning [56], compressive sensing [57]–[63] and multi-coset sensing [64]–[67].
    Table 6 provides a comparison between the different WBSS approaches. TABLE 6 General
    Remarks on WBSS Approaches NBSS approaches concentrate on exploiting the spectral
    opportunities over narrow frequency range; however, due to the large number of
    IoT devices connected to the Internet, CR in IoT will involve the exploitation
    of spectrum opportunities over a wide frequency range in order to achieve higher
    opportunistic throughput [50]. For example, to exploit spectrum opportunities
    in TV bands, WBSS approaches should be implemented. These intend to sense frequency
    bandwidth with higher coherence since NBSS approaches cannot be utilized for WBSS
    as these approaches make a single binary decision and cannot identify single channel
    occupancy state that lie within a wideband spectrum. In the same context, SS approaches
    can also be categorized as blind and knowledge aided based on the required knowledge
    for each approach. For instance, energy-based detection and eigenvalue-based detection
    approaches are categorized as blind spectrum sensing approaches as they need no
    prior knowledge about PU’s signal characteristics while matched filter and cyclostationary
    feature detector are among knowledge aided approaches since they require a full
    or partial prior knowledge about the PU’s signal [35]. Based on the above discussion,
    a CR-based IoT system detects the existence of the PU over a spectrum band of
    interest by adopting a SS approach. The designer can select a proper SS approach
    based on the design factors mentioned in Section III and the available awareness
    of the PU’s information such as BW occupancy and signal characteristics. The selected
    SS approach should satisfies the following selection criteria: it should able
    to detect the PU over the target BW, i.e., spectrum band, it should consume low
    power, i.e., energy efficient, and it should incur minimum computational complexity,
    if possible, As an example, for a SU that employs NB-IoT technology, an NBSS approach
    is selected. Then, based on prior knowledge about PU signal features, a designer
    can determine the most appropriate NBSS approach. Therefore, if the designer has
    no prior knowledge about the PU’s signal features, the ED is the best candidate
    for its simple implementation and low complexity requirement. However, if the
    designer is expecting that the system will experience a noisy radio environment,
    one of the eigenvalue-based detection approaches can be selected. Similarly, if
    the designer has some prior knowledge of the PU signal features, such as cyclic
    prefix or cyclic spectral correlation function; then a CFD is the optimal selection
    for this case, due to its noise and interference immunity. On the other hand,
    in case of WBAN enabling UWB technology, a multi-coset sensing approach is selected
    over the other WBSS approaches, such as wavelet detection or compressive sensing
    approaches, as no prior knowledge about the number of PUs, and sparsity assumption
    are required. In conclusion, the adopted SS approach is selected based on available
    knowledge about the BW occupancy and PU signal features. 2) Decision Making Techniques
    According to the SS observations, the decision is made to declare the presence
    or the absence of the PU over the band of interest. In other words, a single CR
    can make itself sensing decision, i.e., local observation. However, channel impairments,
    such as multi-path fading, shadowing and noise power variation, adversely impact
    the detection making of the CR, especially when using NBSS approaches [68]. Therefore,
    another decision making technique should be employed to improve the local observation.
    A collaboration between CRs by sharing their SS observations can effectively alleviate
    the impact of those impairments. The collaboration process is called Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing (CSS) and can be implemented using three main techniques, they
    are centralized, non-centralized and relay-assisted. Discussing the CSS techniques
    is beyond the scope of this survey, however, a brief description of each technique
    is provided below. First, in the centralized CSS technique, all participant CRs
    detect PU over the designated spectrum band, then forwards their local observations
    to a central entity to determine the final decision about PU existence, next forwards
    back to all participants [69]–[71]. Second, in the non-centralized CSS technique,
    the participants share their local observations between each other and then the
    decision is made by reaching a consensus between the participants [72], [73].
    Finally, relay-assisted technique can be realized by two strategies either Amplify
    and Forward (AF), or Decode and Forward (DF). In AF strategy, once a participant
    CR receives a decision from another CR, it amplifies it and then forwards it to
    another CR, while in DF strategy, a CR decodes the received decision, remodulates
    it and forwards it to another CR [74], [75]. Excessive research works and surveys
    have focused on CSS techniques, methodologies and challenges [56], [76], [77].
    However, this survey paper mainly focuses on the recent works pertain to CR-based
    IoT systems. B. Spectrum Sharing Phase The objective of this functional phase
    is to allocate the vacant band and then utilize it effectively. In other words,
    an energy efficient scheme that avoids collision between SUs and PUs or SUs themselves
    is mandatory. Generally, spectrum sharing can be implemented through network selection,
    spectrum allocation, MAC protocol, power allocation, and spectrum routing and
    mobility. Once sensing decision is made over the designated bands, the SU should
    allocate the band to be used, this can be performed by selecting the suitable
    vacant PU band to be exploited and the way to access that band taking into consideration
    the channel constraints, such as maximum power and BW. For more understanding,
    spectrum sharing rules and models must be discussed before describing the selection
    of a suitable spectrum sharing approach. 1) Spectrum Sharing Rules for efficient
    spectrum sharing process, some rules should be taken into consideration which
    are: at any given instant, each SU can only use one allocated channel over all
    available channels, total interference caused by all SUs over the allocated channel
    must not exceed a maximum allowable limit of interference, and the allocated channel
    should match the SU’s requirements of BW and power. In other words, spectrum sharing
    process is a three step process; they are spectrum allocation, spectrum access,
    and power allocation. Briefly, spectrum allocation is to select the PU and the
    spectrum band among the vacant spectrum bands. Spectrum access is to select the
    MAC, routing, and mobility protocols. Finally, power allocation is to avoid or
    minimize the interference of SUs to the PUs. 2) Spectrum Sharing Models the spectrum
    sharing models can be classified into open sharing and managed sharing as shown
    in Fig. 4. In open access scheme, no central unit controls the access to the band
    to be used by the SUs. Thus, it is a unauthorized access model where a SU or a
    group of SUs can transmit data any time over some designated bands for short distance
    considering a power limited imposed by the regulatory body. For instance, Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) allows ISM (2.4 GHz) for open access, but mandates
    that users should never exceed the imposed peak transmission power [78]. Note
    that, in this scheme the collision between SUs cannot be avoided, especially in
    areas crowded by IoT devices. Hence, IoT devices employ ZiGbee and WiFi standards,
    when no cognition capability is adopted [79]. FIGURE 4. Spectrum sharing models.
    Show All On the other hand, to avoid the collision between SUs themselves and
    between them and PUs, a managed access is employed, where a central entity or
    a policy is required to control and manage SUs’ access to a vacant band. The managed
    sharing techniques can be classified into three main classes, centralized, distributed
    and cooperation between PUs and SUs. First, in a centralized class a SU can attain
    an exclusive use to exploit a designated spectrum band through a legitimate spectrum
    management process such as TVWS Geolocation database and spectrum market. Therefore,
    a regularity body or a PU allows a specific SU to use that spectrum band for a
    certain time over a certain geographical area; as a result, no competition between
    SUs occur to use that spectrum band. For instance, if a SU employs geolocation
    capabilities, e.g., White Space DataBase (WSDB) governed by FCC in the US, provides
    the SU with a list of available spectrum bands and maximum allowable transmission
    power over those bands. The SU, i.e., White Space Devices (WSD), should never
    go over the imposed power limit [80]. Spectrum marketing between PUs and SUs is
    an emerging trend for sharing spectrum bands by either trading or leasing spectrum
    bands [81]. The goal beyond spectrum marketing is to maximize the spectrum efficiency
    by increasing the capacity of networks include PUs and SUs. In spectrum trading,
    negotiations between PUs and SUs might take place to exchange benefits, such that
    PUs might provide SUs an exclusive use for their spectrum band for a certain time
    over a specific geographical location for either forwarding PUs’ data to some
    area beyond their transmission range i.e., coverage area, or some fees. Different
    game models, auction mechanisms might be adopted to implement the contract model-based
    spectrum trading [82], [83]. In spectrum leasing, SUs might lease a specific spectrum
    band for a specific time interval to transmit their data over that spectrum band
    for a certain amount of money [81]. All those trades and leases should follow
    the regulations of government agencies in which spectrum marketing takes place
    [80], [81]. Second, distributed spectrum sharing models also can be categorized
    as either opportunistic, i.e., interweave or coexisting models. In interweave
    model, a SU can exploit the vacant band when PU is idle in one of these dimension
    time, frequency or geographical location. However, PU protection from the SU interference
    is a must; therefore, the SU should always detect the existence of the PU over
    the band during its transmission by adopting either Full Duplex (FD) by which
    a SU can sense and transmit simultaneously [84], or spectrum monitoring techniques
    for this purpose [85]. On the other hand, coexisting models are overlay, underlay
    or hybrid. In all these sharing models, a SU must be aware of PU’s signal characteristics
    so that the SU can simultaneously coexist with the PU over its spectrum band.
    More specifically, in overlay model, the awareness of PU’s signal, i.e., code,
    angle or polarization, enables the SU to transmit data without interfering PUs
    by changing code, angle of transmission or beam-forming [56]. In underlay model,
    the SUs can coexist with PUs in their spectrum bands. If SUs know the PU’s transmission
    power level, therefore, SUs can transmit data for a short range and never exceed
    a certain transmit power limit, while hybrid model is a combination of overlay
    and underlay model [8], [9]. Third, the cooperation between PUs and SUs can be
    implemented by either network coordination or spectrum relaying. In network coordination
    scheme it is assumed that there is a Central Network Operator (CNO) to coordinate
    and manage the spectrum sharing between SUs and PUs by minimizing the interference
    and optimizing the sharing time and power resources so that QoS of the SUs can
    be improved. The CNO selects the PU and SUs to be cooperated using Particle Swarm
    Optimization (PSO) or genetic algorithm [8]. In spectrum relaying, if a PU could
    not reach its throughput target, it asks SUs to cooperate by sending a Request
    To Cooperate (RTC) to the SUs. A SU with an interest to cooperate, replies by
    a confirmation message as Confirm To Cooperate (CTC). As an example, spectrum
    relaying based OFDM, SUs assist the PU using some of its sub-carriers to forward
    PU’s signal, such a scheme is called spectrum relaying. Channel power allocation
    technique, such as Water Filling (WF) algorithms [86], [87], is required to satisfy
    PU’s throughput target. Alternatively, various protocols have been devised to
    perform spectrum sharing based OFDM, where SUs assist the PU using some of its
    sub-carriers to forward PU’s signal, such a scheme is called spectrum relaying.
    Channel power allocation technique, i.e., resource optimization technique, such
    as WF algorithms [86], [87] and interior point method [88], are required to satisfy
    PU’s throughput target. Conventionally most of the SUs adopt Half Duplex (HD)
    relay, in other words, sensing and data transmission cannot be performed simultaneously;
    if the SU senses, no transmission occurs and vice versa. Such kind of system adversely
    impacts the spectrum efficiency. However, the spectrum efficiency of a SU can
    be significantly increased if a SU adopts a FD system [89]. However, this improvement
    comes at the expense of extra hardware complexity (e.g., extra antennas and electronics)
    and computational requirements. The selection of a proper spectrum sharing approach
    has to consider the following three phases which are: 3) Spectrum Allocation The
    spectrum allocation starts with network selection, i.e., PU selection, is an important
    step towards allocating spectrum bands. For SUs use NBSS approaches, the SU determines
    the PU channel before starting detection. However, in case of employing WBSS approaches,
    there always are more than one deployed PU network, i.e., PU transmitters and
    PU receivers. Many approaches can be employed to select the optimal PU network.
    PSO, genetic optimization and game theory are among the best approaches to be
    used for this purpose [8], [90]. Channel allocation is the second step of this
    functional phase, especially when there are multiple PUs and multiple SUs; by
    which each SU will select a designated spectrum band, i.e., channel, to exploit
    or to jointly share. The allocated spectrum band should fit the BW and QoS requirements
    fo the SU. Moreover, before transmitting data, SUs must be aware of the presence
    of other SUs intend to use that allocated channel, i.e., spectrum band, since
    SUs might use different spectrum bands but oblivious of each other. Learning about
    the existence of those intended SUs is known as channel rendezvous [91] and it
    is an important step to communication links between SUs,i.e., CRN configuration.
    The conventional rendezvous algorithms assume to use a Common Control Channel
    (CCC) to establish links between SUs and configure a CRN. However, a CCC is always
    influenced by the dynamic behavior of the PUs over the allocated spectrum band
    and is vulnerable to security threats, therefore, a channel rendezvous might fail
    [92]. For an efficient channel allocation using rendezvous algorithms, a Channel
    Hopping (CH) is adopted to enable SUs to reach a channel consensus within a finite
    number of hops. The most important performance metrics are Maximum Time To Rendezvous
    (MTTR), Expected Time To Rendezvous (ETTR) and Rendezvous Degree (RD). The MTTR
    is defined as the rendezvous latency in the worst case. The ETTR is defined as
    the average rendezvous latency before successfully rendezvous on at least one
    channel, while the RD is defined as the minimum percentage of distinct rendezvous
    channels to the number of common available channels between any pair of SUs. It
    is hoped that the rendezvous can spread out evenly over all common channels in
    order to overcome the vulnerability of one single rendezvous channel and provide
    more rendezvous opportunities [91]–[93]. The work in [79] employed the Round Ribbon
    Tournament to devise a novel asymmetric asynchronous channel hopping algorithm
    for IoT-based CRNs. The devised algorithm achieves guaranteed rendezvous within
    a predefined time. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms the works in [91], [93]
    in the degree of rendezvous. 4) Spectrum Access This phase employs MAC, routing
    and mobility protocols. After allocating the channels, accessing those channels
    can be performed by adopting an appropriate efficient MAC protocol. The designer
    should select a MAC protocol of CR based IoT based on two main criteria. First
    criterion is related to IoT system characteristics, such as data size, transmission
    rate, transmission range, power consumption, latency, employed communication technology,
    and heterogeneity of the systems, i.e., deployment of the system whether it is
    individual or back-haul connection. Second criterion is related to the detected
    spectrum band such as its availability and BW. More specifically, there are three
    factors that play an important role in selecting an energy efficient MAC protocol
    for IoT system. The factors are transmission probability, latency and power consumption.
    Hence, an efficient MAC protocol should incur low cost, low complexity and low
    energy consumption. Moreover, should have ability of channel switching while maintaining
    PU protection, low channel access delay, no collision between SUs when accessing
    the channel, and trades off between duty cycle and control overhead and balances
    between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Finally, a MAC protocol must
    be able to correct errors, i.e., error correction. As an example, the work in
    [94] provides a comprehensive comparison between MAC approaches of two well-known
    standards, namely, IEEE 802.11ah and IEEE 802.15.4. The standards are adopted
    for IoT systems. The comparison shows that IEEE 802.11ah outperforms IEEE 802.15.4
    in data rate, data size, latency, and transmission range. Despite IEEE 802.14.5
    operates with less data rate and over a shorter range than IEEE 802.11ah, it outperforms
    IEEE 802.11ah in power consumption and network capacity since it can accommodate
    more IoT devices than IEEE 802.11ah. Different standard random access MAC protocols,
    such as slotted ALOHA and conventional CSMA/CA, CSMA/CA polling, Orthogonal Frequency
    Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
    have been employed by IoT systems to access the spectrum hole [80]. For instance,
    a CSMA/CA MAC protocol has been adopted in [13], while in [12] slotted ALOHA was
    adopted. The authors in [12] employed an ED as a sensing approach and slotted
    ALOHA protocol as a random access channel for its popularity in Global Mobile
    System (GMS) and LTE. Moreover, the authors derived a closed expression for the
    optimal throughput of narrow band CR-based IoT device with slotted ALOHA for local
    and CSS mechanism. The optimization problem was proposed to maximize the throughput
    of CR-based IoT under constraint of PU protection. However, the work considered
    the channel with only Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and did not consider
    the impact of channel impairments on the performance of the ED, since ED is susceptible
    to dynamic environmental conditions and its performance significantly deteriorates
    under other channel impairments, such as multi-path fading, shadowing and noise
    uncertainty [35]. Moreover, the power consumption was not considered as well.
    On the other hand, some recent works employed non-standard random access MAC protocols.
    For instance, the work in [95] employed conditional interference distribution
    to propose a new cognitive random access mechanism with adaptive transmission
    probability. The transmission probability varies according to the measured interference
    by the IoT device. The proposed mechanism allows the IoT device to share the spectrum
    band used by the PU in non-interfering basis. Moreover, the proposed mechanism
    improves the area spectral efficiency and outperforms the convention ALOHA mechanism.
    Moreover, an energy efficient MAC protocol with a novel channel selection criterion
    was devised in [96]. The protocol significantly reduces the handshakes over control
    and data channels; therefore, improves the energy efficiency by increasing the
    throughput and minimizing the consumed energy. Moreover, the protocol was investigated
    by applying different PU activity models over the channel. Furthermore, the work
    in [97] modified the MAC protocol of IEEE802.11 in order to enable the protocol
    of opportunistically select the channel by adding channel selection algorithm.
    The modified IEEE802.11 outperforms the standard IEEE802.11 with sequential selection
    (i.e., Round Robin) and random channel (i.e., CSMA/CA) selection algorithms in
    both throughput and energy consumption. In addition, Restricted Access Window
    (RAW) is a promising MAC protocol which is adopted for low power IoT network for
    large number of devices with low collision probability. The RAW employs multiple
    equal time slot and allows a limited number of IoT devices to access a specific
    spectrum band at each time slot and spreads devices’ attempts over a long period
    of time to enable an efficient communication for a large number of devices. The
    devices operate in active mode only if their slot turns; otherwise, they operate
    in sleep mode to save power [94]. Besides MAC protocols, spectrum routing and
    mobility protocols are needed to firmly guarantee a PU protection, especially,
    if a PU suddenly resumes its transmission over the licensed spectrum band which
    is opportunistically exploited by a SU. In this case, the SU must leave the spectrum
    band without causing an interference to the PU by switching to another vacant
    spectrum band or immediately cease transmission until that spectrum band becomes
    idle. The band switching process is called spectrum mobility. To perform this
    process efficiently, the SU should be aware of PU activity pattern, in order to
    predict the PU’s behavior, therefore, it can alleviate a collision with the PU.
    Many approaches have been devised to perform an efficient spectrum mobility in
    CRNs. The works in [98], [99] thoroughly explained the principle, mechanism and
    merits of each spectrum mobility approach. The way of when and how a SU switches
    from spectrum band to another band is performed by spectrum routing protocols.
    Those protocols play an important role to significantly improve the spectrum efficiency
    by exploiting the PU’s time varying availability over its spectrum band [8]. A
    survey paper in [100] discussed the joint channel selection and routing from the
    perspective of CRNs. The work provided a comprehensive survey on routing and channel
    selection in CRNs. More specifically, the importance of joint channel selection
    and routing for CRNs. Moreover, the survey highlighted the classification and
    challenges of channel selection and routing strategies. Using the PU behavior
    models, performance metrics and routing metrics, the survey showed how to develop
    an efficient routing protocol. 5) Power Allocation The key aspect of spectrum
    sharing is to optimize the power and energy consumption in order to increase the
    overall spectrum and energy efficiencies of the CR-based IoT. Therefore, power
    allocation approaches have to be employed to realize this objective. Among those
    approaches, point interior approach [88], WF algorithm [86], [101], and game theory
    [90]. The point interior method is generally employed for linear and non-linear
    convex optimization problems. The method mainly approaches the optimal solution
    from the strict interior of the feasible region. On the other hand, the WF algorithms
    are used for radio resource allocation problem for a system with multi channels
    or carriers, where it aims to maximize the sum of data rates or the capacity of
    all channels in the system by optimizing the power distribution of the transmitted
    signals. For CRN, the WF algorithms are used to maximize the sum of throughput
    of all participant CR in the CRN considering their individual peak power constraint
    to guarantee the QoS of the PUs. On the other hand, in case of non-cooperative,
    i.e., a system with selfish CR, game theory is an appropriate tool to model those
    behaviors, since game theory provides the mathematical tools to study the complex
    interactions among interdependent rational players, i.e., selfish CRs, and to
    predict their possible strategies. Different non cooperative game models can be
    employed such as asymmetric Nash bargaining solution-based relay power allocation
    scheme which is used to achieve a balance between global network performance and
    user fairness. Stackelberg game is adopted to model the interaction between the
    relays and the users to find the optimal power allocation, and auction-based power
    allocation algorithms can be used for resource allocation among Device to Device
    (D2D) links reusing the same cellular channels subject to optimizing the system
    capacity [102], [103]. C. Spectrum Management Phase The popularity of IoT system
    encourages IoT users to exchange huge amount of data with their interested parties
    over public and untrusted networks. However, the data should not be exposed to
    every user since those data might be secure, safety critical, or contain private
    and sensitive information. Therefore, it is necessary to enforce security and
    privacy policies, i.e., protocols, to protect the data from any fraudulent acts
    or security threats. The complexity of selected protocol depends on the device
    specifications, networking, and applications [104]. For instance, most of the
    IoT devices are low energy, lightweight devices and use their energy mainly to
    execute their core function applications. This made traditional security algorithms
    not suitable for IoT since they consume much energy and incur high processing
    overhead. Hence, it is necessary to use lightweight energy efficient security
    protocols [105]. Many recent survey works [105]–[108] comprehended this area and
    discussed thoroughly the requirements, architectures, classifications and challenging
    issues for security and privacy protocols for various IoT systems and applications.
    However, in this work, a brief discussion on security and privacy is provided
    below. The discussion covers the important requirements and concepts in this field.
    1) Security To establish a secure IoT system with a large number of IoT devices,
    services and users, three important measures are required. Those measures are
    confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication. First, confidentiality guarantees
    the availability of the data for only the authorized users throughout the data
    exchange process. Data encryption is adopted to avoid the interference and eavesdropping
    of unauthorized users; in other words, strictly limiting the data accessibility
    and disclosure to the authorized users [106]. Second, data integrity is providing
    accurate data to the authorized users during data delivery over the network by
    filtering false data, i.e., tampered and forged data, caused by intended or unintended
    interference. Third, authentication is delivering the data to the legitimate object,
    i.e., a user, a device or an application, which requests a specific data over
    the network. Moreover, availability is an important feature in IoT system, which
    refers to persistent IoT connectivity by making data and devices always available
    when requested by the authorized users and avoid denial of service attack. Note
    that confidentiality, integrity and authentication are information security requirements
    while availability is a functional security requirement that also means continuing
    service provisioning during disruption conditions, i.e., the ability to provide
    a minimum level of service if a failure or power loss occurs [109]. 2) Privacy
    To prevent an adversary, i.e., undesired party, from discovering, eavesdropping
    or/and monitoring private information of other users and to ensure that data can
    be accessed and processed by only the pertinent user. Moreover, privacy allows
    the user to perform specific controls based on a specific portion of the received
    data while prevents it from reaching the rest of that data [110]. Privacy preservation
    mechanisms should be enforced during data collection, aggregation and mining phases
    to block data leakage to the public. Traditional encryption and key management
    mechanisms can be used as privacy mechanisms over data collection and mining phases,
    however, it is not the case for data aggregation phase, since data is aggregated
    and processed in various locations [111]. Despite that there are various attempts
    to tackle an efficient privacy mechanism for data aggregation such as perturbation-based
    privacy mechanisms and anonymity-based privacy mechanisms, this issue is still
    challenging and considered as an open research direction. In summary, for an efficient
    CR-based IoT system, it is recommended to employ lightweight security protocols
    and privacy mechanisms which need minimum communication and processing resources,
    and incur low computational overhead to support the resource constrained IoT devices.
    SECTION V. Integration of Emerging Technologies With CR-Based IoT Systems Integrating
    emerging technologies, such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques,
    i.e., Machine Learning (ML) approaches, with wireless systems is a new step towards
    creating next-generation wireless communication systems with additional capabilities
    such as robust security, autonomy, flexibility, and intelligent architecture.
    This section discusses the impact of adding blockchain and machine learning approaches
    to CR-based IoT systems. A. Blockchain-Enabled CR-Based IoT System The blockchain
    is defined as a tremendous, public, secure and decentralized datastore of ordered
    events, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and is linked to a previous
    block. The events can be updated by “only a majority of users” [112]. Erasing
    information is not allowed. The datastore is owned by no one, controlled by users
    and not ruled by any trusted third party or central regulatory instance. In fact,
    trust is encoded in the protocol and maintained by the community of users. The
    work in [113] presented a comprehensive survey on blockchain, its types, features,
    structures, protocols, and the integration of blockchain and IoT systems. On the
    other hand, the survey in [114] focused on blockchain applications and challenges
    for real world applications. Adopting blockchain technology is a promising solution
    to improve system immunity against hacking activities. The blockchain prevents
    central point system failure and cyber attack which results in improving the security
    in IoT and CRNs. The blockchain protocols employ a two-key encryption system,
    i.e., public and private keys; therefore, robustness is added to the security
    of CRNs [115], [116]. However, the use of blockchain in IoT security is limited
    and focused on the following areas: asymmetric and symmetric key management [117],
    [118], trading of collected data [119], [120], incontrovertible log of events,
    and management of access control to data [121]. The security issues related to
    IoT include authentication and authorization, ownership and identity relationships,
    governance of data and privacy [122]. Blockchain-based research has been used
    to tackle some of these issues. The work by Pureswaran and Brody investigated
    how blockchain contracts support the autonomous workflow and sharing of services
    among IoT devices [123]. IoT devices can benefit from blockchain networks in areas
    related to billing, shipping, e-trading, supply chain management, and energy trading
    [123]. In another work, Bahga and Madisetti proposed a blockchain-based framework
    for industrial IoT [124]. The work by Saghiri et. al proposed a framework for
    IoT based on cognitive systems and blockchain [125]. Such work is still in its
    infancy and worth investigating since introducing blockchain in IoT and CR systems
    shows a promising future in supporting secure data sharing and protecting privacy.
    On the other perspective, employing blockchain protocols in spectrum auction offers
    a decentralized validation which increases the accessibility of the CRNs and reduces
    the implementation complexity, since no central entity is required. In addition,
    blockchain-enabled spectrum access in CRN is a secure spectrum sharing approach
    where it provides an optimal collision-free method to access the spectrum opportunities.
    The work in [115] showed that blockchain-enabled spectrum access in CRN improves
    the security of the CRN and outperforms the conventional random MAC protocol in
    medium and severe radio conditions. The authors in [116] showed that adopting
    blockchain enhances security and performance of CRNs with moving CRs. As a novel
    step towards next-generation wireless networks to enable flexible and secure spectrum
    sharing, the authors in [126] proposed a secure and intelligent architecture with
    three planes, namely., user plane, edge plane and cloud plane, to empower 5G technology
    by integrating blockchain and AI techniques, i.e., Deep Reinforcement Learning
    (DRL). The blockchain is utilized to enable secure and flexible spectrum access
    and enhance privacy protection of the SUs; however, DRL is utilized to provide
    an intelligent resource management since AI techniques can tackle issues such
    as uncertainty, time variant, and complex features. B. Machine Learning-Enabled
    CR-Based IoT System ML approaches are AI applications that establish mathematical
    models based on observations, i.e., training data, to predict or make decisions.
    ML approaches enable systems to automatically learn and improve from experience
    without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML approaches enable computers
    or processors to automatically learn without human intervention and to select
    actions accordingly. ML approaches have a potential ability to analyze and classify
    massive amounts of data which makes ML approaches as efficient and powerful tools
    for performing other processing tasks, such as data analysis, classification [127],
    feature detection, feature extraction [128] and identification [129]. Also, ML
    approaches improve the security and the data privacy for big data systems [130].
    In addition to the aforementioned advantages, ML approaches can apply complex
    techniques in a simple way, and provide accurate results of identifying the targets.
    Therefore, integrating ML approaches with cognitive capabilities can improve the
    effectiveness of processing large volumes of information from various distinctive
    resources. ML approaches have tremendous applications which cannot be covered
    in this section; however, some related applications of ML approaches to IoT and
    CR are addressed below: 1) IoT Health Applications The survey in [127] made an
    assessment for various ML approaches, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest
    Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), etc. In addition,
    the survey determined the criteria of selecting the most appropriate ML approach
    for IoT application. Moreover, the survey considered the application of ML approaches
    for developing IoT smart applications in a smart city as an illustrative example
    to discuss and address the challenges of adopting ML approaches in IoT data analytics
    of smart data traffic. Moreover, the work in [128] proposed a scalable IoT health
    monitoring framework which integrates IoT architecture with LR approach. The proposed
    framework employs 5G mobile networks for the transfer of clinical data into the
    clinical database to enable the necessary action for emergency situations. This
    framework is mainly used for early detection of heart diseases. In [131], the
    authors proposed a monitoring health framework that alarms when acute heart stress
    occurs. The proposed framework employed KNN and LR approaches to predict and detect
    heart stress and uses IoT devices to measure patient’s stress level. 2) CRN Applications
    The work in [132] provided a comprehensive review of various ML approaches applied
    to CRNs. The work categorized ML approaches into decision-making and feature classification.
    Decision-making is employed to determine policies and decision rules for CRs while
    feature classification is used to identify and classify different observation
    models. This work also addressed several challenging learning issues that arise
    in CRNs, in particular in non-Markovian environments and decentralized networks,
    and provided possible solutions. Furthermore, the work identified the conditions
    under which each ML approach can be used. On the other hand, the authors in [133]
    devised CSS algorithms for CRNs based on ML approaches. The SVM and KNN approaches
    were used as classifiers. The energy level estimated at each CR was used to establish
    the feature vector which is categorized using the classifier into two classes,
    idle channel, “no PU activity”, and busy channel, “at least one PU is active”.
    In this work, the proposed algorithms outperformed the traditional CSS techniques,
    i.e., hard and soft fusion techniques, for two reasons. First, ML approaches have
    a capability of implicitly learning the surrounding environment, i.e., topology
    of the PU and CRNs and the channel fading. Second, ML approaches optimize the
    decision region based on feature space which is better than the optimization used
    by the traditional CSS techniques. Moreover, ML approaches play an important role
    in constructing Radio Environment Map (REM) for their accurate prediction, classification
    and learning. The REM is an integrated database consisting of multi-domain information,
    i.e., temporal, spatial, spectrum sensing, etc., to supply CRs with a comprehensive
    radio environment information in their geographical locations [134]. In other
    words, REM is a global situation awareness system that helps CRs to make adaptations
    beyond their individual capabilities. Hence, using REM results in a improving
    detection performance of PUs and SUs, mitigating hidden terminal problem, and
    reducing CRN adaptation time. REMs utilize ML approaches to build a spatio-temporal
    model to predict spectrum usage, i.e., PUs’ activities, [135], to learn radio
    environment parameters [136], and to establish a feature-based detection system.
    The latter is used as an automatic modulation classifier for PU signals and to
    estimate model parameters of the REM [137]. SECTION VI. Challenges, Open Issues,
    and Future Research Directions A. IoT With 5G Technology (5G-IoT) Each new generation
    of wireless technology has brought faster, more reliable cellular and Internet
    connects, starting with the first generation of wireless technology providing
    cellular communication, then 2G providing secure communication i.e., voice and
    text, next 3G introduced the smart phone era and 4G/LTE offered high-speed Internet
    allowing for streaming videos. Currently, the future era of wireless technology
    is moving to 5G, a generation promising life changing innovation with higher bandwidths,
    faster speeds, lower latency and increased capacity allowing more people and devices
    to communicate with each other at the same time, i.e., IoT. 5G requires frequencies
    reaching 300 GHz, compared to LTE which operates at bands below 6 GHz, hence allowing
    for higher capacity and speeds. Despite 5G offering a significant increase in
    speed and bandwidth, its more limited range will require further infrastructure.
    The initial cost to build 5G networks is very expensive since it is a new technology
    and cannot be built on top of an existing network. Therefore, the concept behind
    IoT is predicated on a fast network that can link devices and services together.
    This will allow devices to connect in new ways such as vehicles, city infrastructures,
    appliances, telehealth, etc. In addition, the need for compatible mobile devices
    is a challenge that manufacturers must combat to allow for a global spread of
    this technology. In the last few decades, with each generation challenges have
    emerged and were tackled allowing each generation to move to the next and 5G is
    no exception. Therefore, the main challenges facing 5G-IoT include technical challenges,
    security assurance and privacy concerns, and standardization challenges [138],
    [139]. 1) Technical Challenges Though many research efforts have been made on
    5G-IoT, there are still many technical challenges that needs to be tackled: 5G-IoT
    architecture is the main challenge which needs to be addressed since architecture
    design still impose many challenges, including, scalability and network management,
    interoperability and heterogeneity, security assurance and privacy concerns [140]–[142].
    Wireless Software Defined Network (SDN) is a challenge for network scalability.
    Deployment of IoT applications is challenging due to its large scale, resource
    limited devices and heterogeneous environment; therefore, a multilevel and multidimensional
    service provision platform could be a solution to tackle these challenges an attempt
    is presented in [143]. D2D communication are expected to provide high throughput
    for 5G-IoT. In D2D, the energy and spectral efficiencies are the two challenges.
    Several other technical challenges include dense heterogeneous networks deployment
    in IoT, multiple access techniques for 5G, full-duplex transmission at the same
    time, etc. 2) Security Assurance and Privacy Concerns With faster data speeds
    and higher capacity, security and privacy is a challenge that needs to be tackled
    to secure user’s data. Therefore, new security capabilities at device and network
    levels need to address security and privacy in complex applications including
    smart city, smart networks, telehealth, etc. Moreover, the security and privacy
    factors that need to be considered in designing G5-IoT systems include intrusion
    software, security assurance, backward compatibility, authentication, key management,
    etc [139], [142]. 3) Standardization Issues 5G-IoT is a very complex system, its
    purpose is to connect humans to their surrounding environment, hence due to the
    diversity nature of networks and devices in 5G-IoT, there is a lack of consistency
    and standardization for both IoT systems and applications. Therefore, the main
    standards which are of concern in 5G enabled IoT are: technology and regulatory
    standards. Technology standards include wireless communication, network protocols,
    data aggregation standards; and regulatory standards, include security and privacy
    of data, security solutions, cryptographic primitives. Finally, investigating
    IoT as a service could be the solution for future standardization [139], [144],
    [145]. B. Big Data Management The collected IoT data are streams of huge data
    volumes from various resources with different formats and patterns. IoT data analysis
    and management are important data processing steps towards converting the collected
    data to a useful knowledge that enables an IoT device to make decisions automatically.
    In other words, IoT devices can automatically extract hidden information from
    the collected IoT data and take the most appropriate action through data analysis
    and management. Data classification, clustering, patterning and feature extraction
    are the key functional components of data analysis and management. Data mining
    is the promising technology to perform data analysis and management, since data
    mining technology can extract knowledge from a large scale of data, i.e., big
    data, [146]. The discussion of data mining algorithms and architectures is beyond
    the scope of this survey; however, the surveys in [146]–[148] provided thorough
    overviews on the data mining algorithms, architectures and their challenges for
    IoT. Data management challenges for IoT has seen to be emerging rapidly and no
    doubt with the use of IoT in CRN more and more data is being created. The data
    does not only include traditional data, but also streaming data generated from
    digital sensors from many devices connected to the Internet. The data is usually
    generated in both structured, which is organized and easy to analyze, and unstructured,
    i.e., images and video data, which needs advanced tools to analyze. Therefore,
    advanced data mining techniques are needed to mine streaming data from sensor
    networks. The challenge lies in the shortage of skilled data analysts and the
    need for more research to develop and implement advanced mining tools to mine
    streaming data from CRN and sensor networks [149]. The IoT e-Health envisions
    a seamless connectivity that spans over physical locations; therefore, several
    research challenges related to data management must be overcome in order to achieve
    this. The main challenge is the continuous change of state of data collected from
    the attached sensors on human bodies, i.e., data continuously transmitted and
    collected via the Fog computing nodes [150], hence the IoT e-Health systems has
    to handle the complexity of the data in terms of their variety, volume and velocity.
    Since, the data produced in different formats is application dependent and is
    a challenge that manufacturers or health organizations must tackle by setting
    standards. In addition, Fog admins are needed to monitor the capabilities of Fog
    node hardware and mange the data communication between different medical devices.
    In [150], [151], the challenge of receiving knowledge from big data analysis to
    acquire a valuable decision and big data security issues in healthcare is discussed
    and a proposed solution in [151], [152] is to implement an IoT Fog computing architecture
    which will process, and store data acquired from sensors. The architecture consists
    of two parts: Meta Fog-Redirection and Grouping and Choosing architecture. The
    deployment of large-scale wireless sensors and IoT, can result in extremely huge
    data and hence optimized data processing and hierarchical communication solutions
    are needed to manage such deployments and data processing networks. More research
    work is needed for big data spatial processing specifically for wireless networking
    applications, as more scalable algorithms are required for performing different
    tasks, such as system identification, anomaly detection, and similar problems
    [153]. Moreover, from CR perspective, establishing a comprehensive spectrum modeling,
    accurate spectrum prediction, and flexible spectrum management necessitates the
    employment of big spectrum data techniques. Big spectrum data provides a comprehensive
    knowledge about the existing PUs over a designated geographical location, such
    as PU presence status, received signal strength, signal features, etc [154]. Geolocation
    database, REM and Spectrum Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) are spectrum aware systems
    where a big data architecture takes place in CRNs. A SU can obtain accurate spatio-temporal
    spectrum availability and spectrum prediction from those systems [154]–[156].
    On the other hand, development of an energy efficient and cost-effective big data
    architecture is still facing many challenges. Some of those challenges are: determining
    the volume of required spectrum data for a specific scale, since the volume of
    spectrum data increases by increasing the time duration, frequency band, spatial
    scale of interest, and resolution. Therefore, extra computational power is required
    which results in extra computational burden and latency. As a solution, the use
    of parallel and distributed computing can help alleviating such a problem; however,
    the configuration and maintenance of the parallel and distributed computing are
    still challenging and requires more investigation. alleviating the deterioration
    of the quality of collected spectrum data caused by ambient radio conditions can
    be solved by adopting an appropriate radio propagation model. This challenge is
    more complicated in scenarios that include moving spectrum data collectors. increasing
    the processing and networking capabilities of the adopted big data architecture
    with low overhead can efficiently increase the number of the data users, i.e.,
    SUs. C. IoT Mobility The application of IoT in vehicular environments or moving
    wireless communication system is a new research area, since mobility is a prominent
    characteristic pertinent to the vehicular environment. Numerous problems and challenges
    still require further investigations and need robust solutions. Despite that mobility
    of a CR improves the sensing performance of the moving CR [157]–[159], the handoff
    process of a moving IoT device from one network to another incurs extra computational
    burden to the network coordinator units. On the other hand, the mobility of IoT
    devices adversely impacts the security and privacy of the network, where mobility
    creates uncontrolled environment by merging and leaving of an unexpected IoT device
    to/from IoT networks. This seriously affects the scalability of the networks and
    their connectivity. Consequently, the privacy and resilience are significantly
    impacted because those measures mainly connected to the scalability of the networks
    [107], [111], [160]. In addition, mobility impacts the security, identity management,
    privacy, trust and resilience of IoT networks. The challenge becomes more complicated
    as heterogeneity of IoT devices increases; therefore, developing resilient security
    approaches becomes a demand [107], [110]. Moreover, developing an automatic trust
    computing platform, i.e., automatic trust management, to investigate the trustworthiness
    of emerging IoT device to the IoT networks is another challenge and future research
    direction. D. Global Standards Standardization bodies exert tremendous efforts
    to develop standards for IoT and CRN independently. The work in [7] summarizes
    the standardization efforts for both IoT systems and CRN individually. However,
    the need to bring CR-based IoT into the reality becomes imperative. Therefore,
    some working groups and standardization bodies have developed some standardization
    efforts for CR-based IoT system, for instance, Third Generation Partnership Project
    (3GPP) has completed a standard for NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) using short range
    wireless technologies, such as RFID and NFC. Moreover, the work is still going
    on in developing a standard for IoT using 5G technology and Low Power Wide Area
    (LPWA) network connections [161]. The huge growth of IoT devices and applications,
    besides the upgrading the communication protocols, made the need to globalize
    standards a necessary issue. Hence, there exists no global standard for all different
    IoT devices, since different IoT devices adopt different wireless networks and
    standards. Moreover, data sharing between various IoT devices might lead to decrease
    the required level of security and privacy of communications. Furthermore, quality,
    reliability and transmission rate for remote IoT applications, such as telehealth
    over rural regions, are adversely impacted [14], [162]. Globalizing the standards
    is still a challenging task for the following factors various regulations that
    impose their own constraints, regularity assignments and recommendations on the
    standardization, as described in Section III-C, diversity of employed IoT devices,
    communication technologies, and protocols, which leads to difficulties in comprising
    and tackling all different requirements, especially with the rapid development
    in communication technologies and protocols and deployment scales, since the congestion
    and interference requirements for data transfer over large scale networks do not
    match those requirements for small scale networks. Besides, data privacy and security
    measures differ according to the deployment scale. Finally, developing a global
    standard that comprises all aforementioned factors opens the door for a new future
    research direction in CR-based IoT evolution. SECTION VII. Conclusions The demand
    for smart and CRN enabled IoT systems is ever increasing to perceive the ambient
    radio conditions, analyze RF spectrum and make decisions how, when and where to
    transmit. This demand led to extensive research on designing CR-based IoT systems
    as typical paradigm for smart IoT systems by incorporating the cognition capabilities
    of CR. This survey has provided the existing frameworks of CR-based IoT systems,
    explored the recent SS and spectrum sharing approaches and highlighted the advantages
    and disadvantages of each approach. Moreover, the survey has identified the essential
    requirements of constructing CR-based IoT systems and highlighted the design factors.
    Furthermore, the elements of cognition cycle of CR-based IoT systems has been
    presented and discussed. In addition, the main focus of this survey has been on
    SS and spectrum sharing, since it has developed the criteria of selecting a suitable
    SS approach and MAC protocol for a proper CR-based IoT application. Also, this
    survey has explored and showed the benefits of integrating some emerging technologies,
    such as blockchain and ML approaches, with the CR-based IoT systems. Finally,
    this survey has addressed and highlighted some challenges, future research directions
    and open issues in designing CR-based IoT systems. Authors Figures References

    \ trust and validate their effect on\ndistributed trust and user satisfaction\
    \ in an area of the food supply chain for sustainable business. The\npurpose of\
    \ the present study is to examine determinants of distributed trust in the blockchain-based\n\
    food supply chain and test seven hypotheses derived from the structural equation\
    \ model integrating\ndistributed trust, its three determinants, and user satisfaction.\
    \ Transparency, traceability, and security\nare suggested as three determinants\
    \ of distributed trust along the blockchain-based food supply\nchain. Data were\
    \ collected from users of Chinese ﬁrms employing blockchain-based food supply\n\
    chains to validate the research model and test the seven hypotheses. The present\
    \ study contributes to\nclarifying the signiﬁcance of distributed trust and suggesting\
    \ evidence of its role in the food supply\nchain. The present study discussed\
    \ trust-free systems based on blockchain technology related to\nsustainability\
    \ through the ﬁndings.\nKeywords: distributed trust; trust; blockchain; supply\
    \ chain; smart contract; chaincode; transparency;\ntraceability; sustainability\n\
    1. Introduction\nApplications of blockchain technology to the supply chain enhance\
    \ trust among\nstakeholders and increase the sustainability of businesses [1].\
    \ Stakeholders of the supply\nchain include growers, processors, carriers, distributors,\
    \ retailers, customers, and regulators.\nThey do not know each other well. Centralized\
    \ systems integrating supply chains with\nRFID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation)\
    \ still have limitations in their transparency and\ninformation asymmetry among\
    \ stakeholders [2–4]. Private or permissioned blockchain\nlike Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ [5] is more suitable to the supply chain compared to the public\nblockchain\
    \ like Ethereum. Permissioned blockchain provides better alternatives to protect\n\
    privacy among stakeholders and does not need a resource-intensive and expensive\
    \ PoW\n(Proof of Work) consensus algorithm, contrary to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\
    Food safety is a crucial social issue [6]. In general, food safety problems in\
    \ the supply\nchain result from the three factors of contamination, spoilage,\
    \ and compromise. Contamina-\ntion includes toxins, insects, bacteria, and viruses.\
    \ Spoilage is associated with temperature,\nhumidity, and expiration. Compromise\
    \ refers to tampering, misrepresentation, and substi-\ntution. Failures in food\
    \ safety management lead to distrust among stakeholders of the food\nsupply chain,\
    \ as well as consumers [7]. Permissioned blockchain has been mainly applied\n\
    to the food supply chain since 2018. What kind of characteristics of the blockchain-based\n\
    food supply chain bring distributed trust and user satisfaction? There have been\
    \ many\nstudies on distributed trust dealing with trust among nodes or entities\
    \ of a distributed\nnetwork by ensuring and enhancing security in distributed\
    \ computing systems [8,9] and\non distributed trust in the platform and sharing\
    \ economy applying blockchain [10–12].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10980. https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910980\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10980\n\
    2 of 15\nHowever, there were no empirical studies providing evidence on relationships\
    \ among\ncharacteristics of permissioned blockchains, trust in supply chains,\
    \ and user satisfaction.\nThe purpose of the present study is to examine determinants\
    \ of distributed trust in the\nblockchain-based food supply chain and test seven\
    \ hypotheses derived from the structural\nequation model integrating distributed\
    \ trust, its three determinants, and users’ satisfaction.\nTransparency, traceability,\
    \ and security are suggested as three determinants of distributed\ntrust in the\
    \ blockchain-based food supply chain. Data were collected from users of Chinese\n\
    ﬁrms employing blockchain-based food supply chains to validate the research model\
    \ and\ntest the seven hypotheses. The present study contributes to clarifying\
    \ the signiﬁcance of\ndistributed trust and suggesting the evidence of its role\
    \ in a sustainable food supply chain.\n2. Blockchain-Based Food Supply Chain\n\
    2.1. Three Characteristics of Blockchain-Based Food Supply Chain\nBlockchain is\
    \ one of the most promising technologies for innovating business ecosys-\ntems\
    \ in the supply chain. Blockchain enables secure, reliable, and efﬁcient distributed\n\
    management systems without a trusted third party, which is a core part of centralized\n\
    supply chain management [13]. There are vital components of blockchain technology\n\
    that enable secure, transparent, traceable, and sustainable supply chain management\
    \ as\nfollows [13].\n•\nDistributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network: Unstructured P2P\
    \ network using ﬂooding\nalgorithm and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)/IP\
    \ (Internet Protocol).\n•\nPublic key cryptography (PKI) and hash algorithm: Elliptic\
    \ curve cryptography (ECC),\nSHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)-256 and SHA-3, and Merkle\
    \ tree or Merkle Patricia\nTree for verifying data integrity.\n•\nConsensus algorithm:\
    \ A method of consensus decision-making among participants\nwhich are nodes of\
    \ the blockchain network, where a new block, which is a set of valid\ntransactions\
    \ for a given time, is added to the existing blockchain. There are various\nconsensus\
    \ algorithms such as PoW, proof of stake (PoS), delegated proof of stake\n(DPoS),\
    \ Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), and crash fault Tolerant (CFT) [14].\n•\nSmart\
    \ contract: a self-executing contract with the agreement of stakeholders in the\
    \ case\nof satisfying common contractual conditions written in computer codes\
    \ containing a\nset of rules. The smart contract, which is called a chaincode\
    \ in Hyperledger Fabric,\nplays an important role in ensuring distributed trust.\n\
    •\nDistributed ledger: Storage of transaction records that is consensually shared,\
    \ repli-\ncated, and synchronized among participants in a distributed network.\
    \ The distributed\nledger includes blockchain and smart contracts in Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric.\nThere are various blockchain platforms for supporting blockchain-based\
    \ applications\nsuch as OpenChain, Corda, Etherium, and Hyperledger. Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric is a promising\nplatform for building supply chain management systems.\
    \ Hyperledger Fabric is an open-\nsource and distributed ledger platform initiated\
    \ by Linux Foundation and a private or\npermissioned consortium blockchain network.\
    \ IBM Food Trust is a typical example of\nblockchain-based supply chain applications\
    \ in food safety management [7]. Walmart using\nIBM Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain\
    \ has been applying the blockchain to food safety\nsince the implementation of\
    \ projects in Chain and the US [7].\nA participant or a stakeholder of a supply\
    \ chain is called a client in Hyperledger Fabric\nand writes an application or\
    \ a smart contract (called a chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric)\nof a transaction.\
    \ Participants (called endorsing peers in Hyperledger Fabric) execute and\nvalidate\
    \ the application and the smart contract. They (called ordering peers in Hyperledger\n\
    Fabric) reach consensus through voting via consensus algorithm (BFT or CFT in\
    \ Hyper-\nledger Fabric). The validated and committed transactions are added to\
    \ a new block and\nthe related ledger is updated. Any transactions added to a\
    \ block can never be modiﬁed\nor altered because all blocks are linked by using\
    \ a hash algorithm which is SHA-256 or\nSHA-3.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10980\n\
    3 of 15\nAccording to [2], considerable advancement in supply chain management\
    \ has taken\nplace since the 1990s, which has resulted in integrating the supply\
    \ chain into enterprise\nresource planning (ERP). However, transparency and traceability\
    \ are still a big challenge, in\nparticular, with complex transactions. Transparency\
    \ and traceability are the critical factors\nrequired in improving the quality\
    \ of fresh foods [15]. A blockchain-based supply chain\nenhances transparency,\
    \ traceability, and security, compared to conventional supply chain\nsystems.\
    \ The three characteristics described in Table 1 contribute to building distributed\n\
    trust among stakeholders of the supply chain. The blockchain-based supply chain\
    \ is more\ntransparent than conventional systems in terms of openness, accessibility,\
    \ and visibility.\nBlockchain provides higher visibility and accessibility in\
    \ terms of information, inventory,\nand ﬁnancial ﬂows. The shared visibility of\
    \ transactions, their validation, and distributed\ngovernance enable a high level\
    \ of transparency. Stakeholders can track back, referring to\nwhere the food came\
    \ from, and trace forward to determine who it was sold to, as needing\nthe case\
    \ of provenance and recall. Real-time sensor data across the supply chain are\
    \ avail-\nable to each stakeholder through a connection with IoT devices [4,16].\
    \ The system based on\nblockchain brings a higher level of transparency and traceability\
    \ to all the stakeholders of\nthe food supply chain including regulators and auditors.\
    \ Distributed trust is not trust from\nthe trusted third parties of conventional\
    \ centralized systems but among stakeholders who\nare unknown to each other. Sustainability\
    \ assuring the 3Ps (people, planet, and proﬁt) and\nESG (environment, society,\
    \ and governance) is available from the blockchain-based supply\nchain because\
    \ all stakeholders share information about human rights, the environment,\nand\
    \ governance. They can also verify all related documents across the supply chain.\n\
    Table 1. Characteristics of the blockchain-based supply chain.\nCharacteristics\n\
    Overview of Enabling Technology\nSource\nTransparency and\nTraceability\n-\nAll\
    \ transactions, which were agreed upon by stakeholders through a consensus\nalgorithm,\
    \ are shared in a secure and immutable distributed ledger. Smart\ncontracts make\
    \ transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.\n-\nAll stakeholders\
    \ can conﬁrm and trace those who are responsible for products at\nany given time\
    \ because smart contracts record ownership rights depending on\ntheir changes\
    \ in the supply chain and are stored in the blockchain network.\n-\nIn particular,\
    \ a channel component of Hyperledger Fabric that the stakeholders of\na supply\
    \ chain can use to communicate with each other shows a validated ledger\nto the\
    \ relevant stakeholders of a blockchain. The channel enables eligible\nstakeholders\
    \ of a blockchain network to carry out transactions privately with each\nother\
    \ with a subset of other stakeholders.\n-\nBlockchain-based supply chain systems\
    \ with IoT (Internet of Things) devices\nimprove the tracing ability and visibility.\n\
    [4,16–18]\nSecurity\n-\nPKI and cryptography provide conﬁdentiality and privacy,\
    \ data integrity, and\nnon-repudiation services in a blockchain.\n-\nThe Membership\
    \ Service Provider (MSP) component of Hyperledger Fabric,\nwhich assumes the roles\
    \ of Certiﬁcation Authority (CA) based on PKI provides\nauthenticity service in\
    \ a blockchain network for protecting privacy. The channel of\nHyperledger Fabric\
    \ plays a role in protecting privacy among stakeholders.\n[17,18]\n2.2. A Survey\
    \ of Blockchain-Based Food Supply Chain in China\nChina has been facing a big\
    \ problem of fake and counterfeited food, and most Chinese\nfeel great anxiety\
    \ about food safety. Chinese ﬁrms implemented applications of blockchain\nto the\
    \ food supply chain for solving the problems of food safety. JD.com had collabo-\n\
    rated with IBM to apply blockchain to logistics areas since 2016. JD released\
    \ open-source\nblockchain systems called JD Chain in 2018. Over 1000 brands including\
    \ farmers, proces-\nsors, importers, and shippers participated in the blockchain\
    \ systems. Consumers scan QR\n(Quick Response) codes or use NFC (Near Field Communication)\
    \ with their mobile phones\nto track all the details of products at all stages\
    \ throughout the supply chain and check their\nauthenticity.\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 10980\n4 of 15\nIn 2016, Walmart launched two blockchain projects by partnering\
    \ with IBM. One is\npork import from China. The other is mango import from America\
    \ [7]. IBM developed a\nFood Trust system based on Hyperledger Fabric for improving\
    \ food supply chain manage-\nment. Walmart China collaborated with VeChain which\
    \ is a platform offering a blockchain\nas a service to ﬁrms to enhance food tracking,\
    \ traceability, and safety through the supply\nchain in 2019.\nIn 2018, a consortium\
    \ known as the Food Trust Framework, which is a system for\ntracing food based\
    \ on blockchain, was established for tracking food produced in China\nand applied\
    \ to imports from Australia and New Zealand (products such as ﬁsh oil from\nAustralia\
    \ and dairy from New Zealand) in 2018. Merchants of Taobao and Tmall can\nuse\
    \ blockchain systems to verify the authenticity of products. Consumers can scan\
    \ the\nQR codes of products with their mobile phones and get information about\
    \ the place\nof origin and transaction history. Regulators can also monitor the\
    \ supply chain. The\npurpose of the Food Trust system is to provide traceability\
    \ and transparency in the food\nsupply chain to stakeholders including growers,\
    \ processors, distributors, regulators, and\nconsumers. Recently, Alibaba globally\
    \ provided blockchain solutions of supply chain\nmanagement known as Alibaba Cloud\
    \ BaaS (Blockchain as a Service). The BaaS combines\ncloud computing services,\
    \ IoT, and blockchain solutions, which enables ﬁrms to build their\nown applications\
    \ to guarantee traceability and transparency of supply chain systems [19].\n3.\
    \ Research Model and Research Hypothesis\nDistributed trust refers to the belief\
    \ in the blockchain-based system, which enables\nstakeholders who do not know\
    \ each other well to trust through consensus among them\nwithout a third party\
    \ [10]. First, blockchain-based systems allow participants to securely\nshare\
    \ transaction information among them without a third party. Second, it is really\n\
    impossible to modify the transactions agreed upon by participants in the blockchain-based\n\
    system. Finally, trust among participants comes not from individual trustworthiness,\
    \ but\nthe distributed system itself enabled by blockchain technology and smart\
    \ contracts.\nAccording to the authors of [10], the three stages of trust consist\
    \ of local trust, insti-\ntutional trust, and distributed trust. Local trust is\
    \ related to trust based on one-to-one\ninteractions and personal reputation among\
    \ well-known people [10]. Institutional trust\ncomes from institutional mechanisms\
    \ ranging from reputations and brand images of the\nthird party to things like\
    \ insurance and contracts [10]. Distributed trust ﬂows through\nnetworks, marketplaces,\
    \ and platforms not from a single source like a third party, but\nacross a variety\
    \ of sources sharing responsibility by using blockchain technology and smart\n\
    contracts [20] (p. 1) asserted that “the inherited characteristics of the blockchain\
    \ enhance\ntrust through transparency and traceability within any transaction\
    \ of data, goods, and\nﬁnancial resources”. Blockchain provides the ability to\
    \ enhance transparency and traceabil-\nity in transactions to organizations and,\
    \ in turn, the increased transparency and traceability\npositively affect trust\
    \ in organizations positively [21,22]. Blockchain allowing transactions\nand relevant\
    \ data to be securely stored and veriﬁed without any trusted third parties\nenhances\
    \ trust among participants. The characteristics of blockchain include transparency,\n\
    traceability, and security [18].\nIn the presented study, distributed trust is\
    \ deﬁned as the degree to which supply\nchain stakeholders who do not know each\
    \ other well trust counterparts and transactions in\nthe blockchain-based food\
    \ supply chain. Transparency is deﬁned as the degree to which\nstakeholders of\
    \ a food supply chain believe that transactions and related information\nare transparent.\
    \ Traceability is the degree to which stakeholders of a food supply chain\nbelieve\
    \ that they can track and trace all information about a product’s origin, location,\n\
    and history of a speciﬁed item across the food supply chain to verify when and\

    \ ability to know what is happening upstream in the sup-\nply chain and to communicate\
    \ this information among stakeholders across the supply\nchain [31]. A higher\
    \ level of transparency is associated with consumer’s willingness to pay\n2% to\
    \ 10% more for products through a transparent supply chain [31]. Transparency\
    \ is\ndirectly associated with the provision of information to reduce uncertainty\
    \ related to prod-\nucts or services [26]. Transparent information contributes\
    \ to reducing uncertainty in supply\nchain systems. According to [26], there exists\
    \ a signiﬁcant positive relationship between\ntransparency and trust. Blockchain\
    \ transparency has a positive signiﬁcant effect on supply\nchain performance [25].\
    \ Blockchain improves accessibility, visibility, accountability, and\ncooperation\
    \ for stakeholders in the food supply chain [32]. Accordingly, transparency is\
    \ an\nimportant determinant of trust and satisfaction. The present study posits\
    \ the following\nhypotheses:\nHypothesis 1 (H1). Transparency has a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on distributed trust in the blockchain-\nbased food supply chain.\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 10980\n6 of 15\nHypothesis 2 (H2). Transparency has a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on satisfaction in the blockchain-based\nfood supply chain.\nTraceability refers\
    \ to the ability to trace the origin, history, and location of an entity\nunder\
    \ consideration [24]. Ref [33] deﬁned traceability as the process by which ﬁrms\n\
    track materials and products and the conditions in which they were produced through\n\
    the supply chain. Blockchain lets stakeholders of the supply chain track the status\
    \ in\nreal time and monitor the quality of products or services in real time.\
    \ For example, a\nrefrigerated container equipped with IoT devices can record\
    \ any unsafe ﬂuctuations on\nthe blockchain [2]. Ref. [28] deﬁned blockchain traceability\
    \ as the ability to track and trace\nproducts and transaction documents including\
    \ bill of lading and shipping notiﬁcations\nalong the supply chain. Stakeholders\
    \ of the supply chain can track and validate the origin\nof food by using a digital\
    \ code with a digital signature [28]. An effective food traceability\nsystem is\
    \ an important tool not only to manage food quality and safety risks but also\
    \ to\npromote the development of effective food supply chain management [34].\
    \ Many food\nscandals and incidents have occurred in China. Traceability contributes\
    \ to achieving\nconsumer conﬁdence in the food industry and helps to build customers’\
    \ trust [27]. The\npresent study posits the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis\
    \ 3 (H3). Traceability has a positive inﬂuence on distributed trust in the blockchain-\n\
    based food supply chain.\nHypothesis 4 (H4). Traceability has a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on satisfaction in the blockchain-based\nfood supply chain.\nMany studies show\
    \ evidence of a signiﬁcant relationship between perceived security\nand consumers’\
    \ trust in e-commerce [35]. According to [23], the security of banking systems\n\
    has a signiﬁcant positive effect on customer satisfaction. Ref. [36] argued that\
    \ blockchain\nsecurity contributes to improving trust among trade partners through\
    \ in-depth interviews\nwith industry experts. According to a study [2] on transparent\
    \ and secure supply chains,\none of the core functions of a blockchain is to enable\
    \ an unlimited number of anonymous\nparties to transact securely with one another\
    \ without a central third party. Accordingly, a\ntransparent and secure supply\
    \ chain increases stakeholders’ trust in the food supply chain.\nBlockchain with\
    \ channel function like Hyperledger Fabric assures privacy protection by\nprohibiting\
    \ unauthorized participants’ access to some secret information in the food supply\n\
    chain. The present study posits the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 5 (H5).\
    \ Security has a positive inﬂuence on distributed trust in the blockchain-based\n\
    food supply chain.\nHypothesis 6 (H6). Security has a positive inﬂuence on satisfaction\
    \ in the blockchain-based food\nsupply chain.\nThere have been many studies regarding\
    \ the relationship between trust and satis-\nfaction [37]. A study [37] regarding\
    \ corporate social responsibility of telecommunication\ncompanies argued that\
    \ customer satisfaction had a signiﬁcant positive effect on customer\ntrust. Ref.\
    \ [38] showed a signiﬁcant positive relationship between satisfaction and trust\n\
    in the Airbnb context. Ref. [39] investigated the effect of trust on life satisfaction\
    \ in the\ncontext of WeChat use in China. Trust in both individuals and institutions\
    \ has a signiﬁcant\npositive effect on life satisfaction [39].\nHypothesis 7 (H7).\
    \ Distributed trust has a positive inﬂuence on satisfaction in the blockchain-\n\

    \ Measurement and Sampling Design\nTable 3 shows the measurement items for the\
    \ ﬁve constructs in the proposed research\nmodel. A total of 28 question items\
    \ were developed by referring to previous studies [25,26].\nEach question item\
    \ was measured on a ﬁve-point Likert scale. The survey was conducted\nwith companies\
    \ using the blockchain-based food supply chain. One sample from each\ncompany\
    \ was collected. To reach users who are responsible for using a blockchain-based\n\
    food supply chain in their ﬁrms, the present study employed purposive sampling\
    \ and\nsnowball sampling methods. Purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling\
    \ method in\nwhich researchers rely on their own judgment when choosing samples.\
    \ Snowball sampling\nis also a non-probability sampling method in which researchers\
    \ recruit participants from\namong their acquaintances, and then, in turn, the\
    \ informants introduce new participants\nto researchers. The questionnaire was\
    \ published by using Wenjuanxing (www.wjx.ch\n(accessed on 5 November 2020)) which\
    \ is the most popular website for online surveys in\nChina and was sent out through\
    \ WeChat or email for online survey. Each questionnaire\nwas sent to supply chain\
    \ representatives who were members of the China Animal Health\nand Food Safety\
    \ Alliance (CAFA), which is a government-backed organization under the\nChinese\
    \ National Agricultural Science Technology Innovation Alliance. VeChain is one\
    \ of\nthe council members of CAFA. Excluding missing data, error responses, and\
    \ inadequate\nanswers, a total of 318 valid responses were used for the analyses.\n\

    6. Conclusions\nBlockchain is an enabler of distributed transaction and management\
    \ instead of a\ncentralized approach with third parties. A variety of stakeholders\
    \ as actors of business\necosystems participate in the blockchain-based food supply\
    \ chain. Participants including\nproducers, processors, distributors, retailers,\
    \ consumers, and regulators want to have\ntransparent, traceable, and secure transactions.\
    \ Our ﬁndings suggest that transparency,\ntraceability, and security are determinants\
    \ of distributed trust in the food supply chain.\nTransparency has a signiﬁcant\
    \ inﬂuence on user satisfaction. In particular, distributed trust\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 10980\n12 of 15\nplays a mediating role in relationships between the\
    \ three determinants and satisfaction.\nTwo characteristics of blockchain technology,\
    \ traceability and security, indirectly affect user\nsatisfaction, although these\
    \ two variables do not directly inﬂuence it.\nBlockchain technology has been mainly\
    \ applied and diffusing in the areas of the\ncryptocurrency and ﬁnance industry\
    \ initiated by Bitcoin since 2009. Hyperledger began in\nDecember 2015 by the\
    \ Linux Foundation. Since 2008, companies such as IBM, Walmart,\nAlibaba, and\
    \ JD.com have launched solution services for food supply chain management\nuntil\
    \ 2018. Applications of blockchain to the supply chain are still in the initial\
    \ stages. Most\nof all studies have focused on technical approaches regarding\
    \ blockchain applications. The\npresent study can be a guide for future behavioral\
    \ studies for blockchain applications.\nThe present study contributes to the advancement\
    \ of research regarding trust-free\nsystems and the relationship between system-like\
    \ trust and human-like trust in technology.\nTrust in technology exists along\
    \ a continuum of technology’s humanness, which is repre-\nsented by the extent\
    \ to which users perceive it to be more human-like or systems-like [50].\nHuman-like\
    \ trust consists of integrity, ability, and benevolence, whereas system-like trust\n\
    includes reliability, functionality, and helpfulness. According to the authors\
    \ of [51,52],\nmore human-like technology such as Facebook and Airbnb is strongly\
    \ associated with\nusefulness and continuance intention, whereas more system-like\
    \ technologies like MS\nAccess and Expedia.com had a stronger inﬂuence on usefulness\
    \ and continuance intention.\nThe blockchain-based supply chain resembles the\
    \ system-like technology more than the\nhuman-like technology. Our ﬁndings imply\
    \ that three determinants of distributed trust,\nincluding transparency, traceability,\
    \ and security, improve trust in technology.\nThree papers deal with trust in\
    \ blockchain and trust-free issues [11,53,54]. Ref. [54] sug-\ngested multi-dimensions\
    \ of factors inﬂuencing trust in blockchain by using data collected\nfrom interviews\
    \ and applying grounded theory. Factors including security, technology\ndevelopment,\
    \ disintermediation, privacy, convenience, personal innovativeness, and eco-\n\
    nomic factors [53] were used to examine issues regarding trust-free systems based\
    \ on\nblockchain by applying a systematic literature review. Both studies focused\
    \ on Bitcoin and\npayment systems as application domains of blockchain. The authors\
    \ of [11] designed a\nsystem based on smart contracts of Ethereum, where smart\
    \ contracts play the role of escrow,\nmediating the interactions between forecasters\
    \ and requesters under online crowdsourcing\nsettings. The authors of [55] discussed\
    \ the limits of trust-free systems based on blockchain\ntechnology in the sharing\
    \ economy.\nBlockchain-based systems can be an alternative for solving distrust\
    \ problems result-\ning from human opportunistic behaviors, arbitrary judgments,\
    \ and mistakes without a\ntrusted third party. Trust-free systems can be designed\
    \ and implemented by applying\nblockchain and smart contracts to a speciﬁc scope\
    \ and within a given governance like a\nvending machine in a physical world. In\
    \ general, blockchain technology including smart\ncontracts contributes to trustworthy\
    \ systems enabling more transparent, traceable, and\nsecure transactions, and\
    \ also accelerates decentralized organizational structure and busi-\nness ecosystems.\
    \ Although blockchain can partially shift trust in people and institutions to\n\
    trust in technology in a speciﬁc domain, human roles as well as law and institutions,\
    \ are\nstill crucial to build trust in the blockchain-based supply chain for sustainable\
    \ businesses.\nIssues regarding the relationship between the trust-free system\
    \ and sustainability remain\nfor further research. In addition, further research\
    \ dealing with the relationship between\ndistributed trust and smart contracts\
    \ also needs to be followed. Our research model can be\napplied to many areas\
    \ related to trust based on blockchain. An empirical study regarding\nthe relation\
    \ of blockchain technology and sustainability is an important further research\n\
    area. OECD argues that blockchain is an enabler for sustainable services through\
    \ a case\nstudy in the areas of emissions certiﬁcate trading systems and contract\
    \ management sys-\ntems because transparency, security, and process efﬁciency\
    \ can be leveraged to drive the\nsystematic changes by providing sustainable infrastructure\

    \ was introduced through Bitcoin in a 2008 whitepaper by the\nmysterious Satoshi\
    \ Nakamoto. Since its inception, it has gathered great attention because of its\
    \ unique\nproperties—immutability and decentralized authority. This technology\
    \ is now being implemented in\nvarious ﬁelds such as healthcare, IoT, data management,\
    \ etc., apart from cryptocurrencies. As it is a\nnewly emerging technology, researchers\
    \ and organizations face many challenges in integrating this\ntechnology into\
    \ other ﬁelds. Consent management is one of the essential processes in an organization\n\
    because of the ever-evolving privacy laws, which are introduced to provide more\
    \ control to users\nover their data. This paper is a systematic review of Blockchain’s\
    \ application in the ﬁeld of consent\nand privacy data management. The review\
    \ discusses the adaptation of Blockchain in healthcare, IoT,\nidentity management,\
    \ and data storage. This analysis is formed on the principles of the Preferred\n\
    Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and a process\
    \ of systematic\nmapping review. We provide analysis of the development, challenges,\
    \ and limitations of blockchain\ntechnology for consent management.\nKeywords:\
    \ blockchain; consent management; privacy\n1. Introduction\nPersonal data has\
    \ been added to the long list of precious commodities. Personal\ninformation could\
    \ be anything—a name, an identiﬁcation number, medical data, or location\ndata.\
    \ With the world transforming swiftly in terms of technology, every digital activity\
    \ is\nregistered and collected, which may contain sensitive individual information.\
    \ According to\na survey, there will be approximately 75 billion smart devices\
    \ by 2025 [1], which will collect\nuser data to monitor. Users give access to\
    \ these devices to manage their data deliberately\nor without consent, as they\
    \ seem reliable, and user proﬁles are created based on the data\nprovided. This\
    \ information can be exploited by systems that examine the characteristics\nand\
    \ preferences of the user; they attempt to inﬂuence decisions by showing content\
    \ based\non aggregated proﬁles. In 2016, Cambridge Analytica had access to 87\
    \ million Facebook\nusers [2], which were acquired via users who were using a\
    \ third-party application known\nas “This Is Your Digital Life”, where they unknowingly\
    \ gave access to the app, which\ncollected their information and their friend’s\
    \ network information as well. Using extensive\ndata, the company tried to inﬂuence\
    \ then ongoing voters (US Presidential Election 2016)\nby various means. There\
    \ are also other incidents where personal data is misused for illicit\nreasons.\
    \ So more than anything, it is crucial to understand the policies and the need\
    \ for\ndata consent, which brings us to an important topic—consent management.\n\
    Consent management is the action or process to manage user and customer consent\n\
    for processing personally identiﬁable data. In other words, it ensures that users\
    \ can select\nand revoke their consent if desired in different categories (preferences).\
    \ The main steps in\nthis process are collecting consent from users and storing\
    \ the consent in a secure database,\nwhich allows users to withdraw or revoke\
    \ and renew their consent. While the process\nseems simple, it has many challenges,\
    \ especially for big organizations as individual data is\nscattered around their\
    \ business, sitting in company silos. Consent is usually collected using\nHealthcare\
    \ 2021, 9, 137. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020137\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\n\
    Healthcare 2021, 9, 137\n2 of 21\na variety of techniques (websites, mobile applications,\
    \ and various marketing platforms),\nmaking it very difﬁcult to aggregate data\
    \ (map the data collected to a single person).\nOnce aggregated, the next challenge\
    \ is to store the data in a single repository (a secure\ndatabase). Data transparency\
    \ is another challenge that needs to be focused on, as users\ndo not have the\
    \ perfect knowledge about how their data is being operated. Organizations\nshould\
    \ also ensure that proper resources are available so that users can see and modify\n\
    their data preferences. Identity management is a factor that needs to be considered\
    \ while\ncollecting the user’s consent to the integrity of the information provided.\
    \ The complexity\nof implementation becomes harder as privacy rules evolve. These\
    \ are just a few of the\ntechnical challenges with consent management. The other\
    \ challenge is to inform the user\nof the purpose of obtaining consent and to\
    \ make the user aware of it. Additionally, there\nmay be users that approve of\
    \ the processing of personal information for all reasons and\nactivities, in most\
    \ instances. However, individuals would like to limit their consent, as a\nresult,\
    \ with consent management, all these requirements must be addressed while ensuring\n\
    compliance with the privacy laws.\nWe believe that consent management with Blockchain\
    \ makes the process easier, more\naccessible, and more secure; as it is a decentralized\
    \ technology, it can make the process\nmore transparent and approachable for users.\
    \ A blockchain is a digital transaction archive\nthat is duplicated and circulated\
    \ on the blockchain over the entire computer network. It is\nindeed important\
    \ to mention that the tech giants and banking sectors have invested billions\n\
    of dollars in Blockchain [3]. Bitcoin was the ﬁrst cryptocurrency to use this\
    \ technology,\nand later, more cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Dash started\
    \ using this technology.\nIn 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed the idea of Ethereum\
    \ and started operating on 30 July\n2015; Hyperledger was launched by Linux Foundation\
    \ in December 2015 and had received\ncontributions from IBM, SAP Ariba, and Intel\
    \ [4]. While Bitcoin, Monero, and Dash\nare referred to as the ﬁrst generation\
    \ of Blockchain, Ethereum comes under the second\ngeneration of Blockchain; the\
    \ third generation of Blockchain are applications that have\nbeen developed for\
    \ various sectors such as healthcare, IoT, supply chain management\n(SCM), identity\
    \ management, etc. The third section explains how Blockchain helps with\nthe consent\
    \ management process.\nThe purpose of this paper is to systematically collect\
    \ and classify all related Blockchain\nresearch papers from a renowned organization\
    \ (IEEE), and to achieve the desired purpose,\nwe carried out a systematic review\
    \ of the Blockchain literature to show some useful insights.\nThere are a few\
    \ insightful analyses of this subject in the literature, our methodologies and\n\
    objectives vary from one another, and most of the reviews focus on one application\
    \ of\nBlockchain (healthcare, education, or data management). We focused on various\
    \ applica-\ntions of Blockchain (in the ﬁeld of consent management) such as healthcare,\
    \ IoT, identity\nmanagement, and data storage. In the review conducted by Ali\
    \ Alammary et al. [5], the\nprime focus was on the applications of Blockchain\
    \ in the ﬁeld of education. Healthcare\nwas the main application of the systematic\
    \ review that was conducted by Cornelius C.\nAgbo et al. [6] and Tsung-Ting Kuo\
    \ et al. [7]. While Fran Casino et al. [8] discussed the\nvarious applications\
    \ of Blockchain, their review was not in the area of consent management.\nTherefore,\
    \ to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review covering a\
    \ few\nareas in the ﬁeld of consent management. Our systematic review follows\
    \ the guidelines set\nby PRISMA [9]. It is a well-structured research protocol\
    \ for systematic review ensuring\na thorough and impartial analysis of all published\
    \ peer-reviewed papers that apply to\nthe topic.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Consent management and its importance\nand challenges are presented\
    \ in Section 2. An overview of blockchain is presented in\nSection 3. Section\
    \ 4 presents the research methodology we have followed. The results\nare presented\
    \ in Section 5, and a discussion of the challenges and possible solutions\nare\
    \ presented in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and offers ideas\
    \ for\nfuture work.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n3 of 21\n2. Consent Management\n\
    Consent is strictly related to a processing purpose, which is the purpose that\
    \ the per-\nsonal data of an individual is processed for, such as marketing, analysis,\
    \ or healthcare [10].\nConsent management is a method, procedure, or collection\
    \ of policies to enable users to\nspecify what information they are willing to\
    \ allow access to various care providers [11].\nThe main steps in consent management\
    \ involve:\n1.\nCollection of consent;\n2.\nStorage of consent;\n3.\nUse of collected\
    \ consent and data.\n2.1. Collection of Consent\nConsent can be collected from\
    \ a variety of sources—websites, mobile applications,\nCRM (Customer Relationship\
    \ Management) systems, marketing platforms, contact centers,\nand sales points.\
    \ The most traditional way of obtaining consent is through terms of\nconditions/services\
    \ or CMP (consent management platform). The main challenge is the\nprocess of\
    \ collecting informed consent from the user. For an instance, a patient might\
    \ be\nwilling to share his data with a physician but not willing to share his\
    \ data with a medical\nresearcher. In this scenario, the user provided partial\
    \ consent to share his data. Therefore,\nthe consent management system should\
    \ also be designed to capture partial consent from\nthe user. Another example\
    \ could be a user using an IoT device. Initially, the user provided\nconsent for\
    \ sharing his preferences of a smart device with the service provider but could\n\
    decide against sharing at any point in time. Considering the change, the system\
    \ should\nalso allow the user to revoke the consent at any period.\nWith the introduction\
    \ of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and other privacy\nlaws in various\
    \ countries, companies must make sure the user is entirely aware of the\nconsent\
    \ they are giving. The company must provide precise information regarding the\n\
    situations where their data will be utilized; in other words, there should be\
    \ transparency.\n2.2. Storage of Consent\nAs indicated above, consent is collected\
    \ using a variety of methods, the main task\nafter collecting consent is to aggregate\
    \ the data. Once properly collected, consent should\nbe stored in a single source\
    \ of truth, which should be a secure database. Data storage is\nvery important,\
    \ as it should be stored in a secure location. Data should also be modeled\nbased\
    \ on the requirement.\nThe period of data storage is another important case, as\
    \ the data cannot be stored\nfor longer periods, only for the shortest possible\
    \ time the data must be stored. The\norganizations usually come up with the period\
    \ of data storage, and they must also ensure\ncorrect and up-to-date information\
    \ is maintained. According to GDPR, the time for which\npersonal data are kept\
    \ should be strictly limited to Recital 39 of the GDPR [12], and the\ndata controller\
    \ shall set limits for deleting information.\n2.3. Use of Collected Consent and\
    \ Data\nThe following questions arise and need to be addressed after receiving\
    \ and storing\nthe consent:\n•\nHow is the obtained consent used for data access\
    \ regulation?\n•\nAre all policies such as GDPR and CCPA (California Consumer\
    \ Privacy Act) met?\n•\nAre there sufﬁcient resources to maintain the transparency\
    \ of data?\nData of a user can be shared with any third-party organizations based\
    \ on the consent\nthat is collected. Overall, the main challenging part of the\
    \ consent management system is\nto get and maintain consent in a customizable,\
    \ effective, and transparent way. Ensuring\nall the conditions set out in the\
    \ various privacy laws is also very important, as failure\ncould lead to severe\
    \ penalties. Organizations should also inform users of the purpose\nof their data,\
    \ and users should also be informed if their data is sold to third parties for\n\
    Healthcare 2021, 9, 137\n4 of 21\nmarketing/research purposes. By following all\
    \ these, the process will be very transparent,\nwhich, in turn, will help the\
    \ organization to build trust with its customers. After ensuring\nall the policies\
    \ are met, there should also be resources to help the customer if they want to\n\
    revoke/withdraw their consent.\nFailure in following the regulations can lead\
    \ up to 10 million Euros or two percent\nof the annual turnover of the company\
    \ [13]. In the following section, we explained how\nBlockchain works and how it\
    \ helps to achieve consent management.\n2.4. Efﬁciency Challenges of Current Consent\
    \ Management\nThere are multiple data sources such as patient health information,\
    \ social media data,\ndata collected from the IoT devices, etc. Since all of these\
    \ data sources contain sensitive\ninformation of individual users, they need to\
    \ be maintained securely. More importantly,\nwe should also have a systematic\
    \ and transparent consent collection by the present systems.\nSome challenges\
    \ identiﬁed in the current systems include:\n•\nMethodologies used for consent\
    \ collection. The current systems are not capable of\ncollecting or requesting\
    \ speciﬁc consent from the users. They use sophisticated single\nterms and conditions\
    \ (T&C). Instead of that, consent should be collected for speciﬁc\npurposes, and\
    \ it must be presented in a simpliﬁed manner.\n•\nData Regulation. After the consent\
    \ is collected, the data sharing must be regulated\nto avoid unwanted sharing\
    \ of the data. Additionally, current systems do not have a\nstandard platform\
    \ where the data could be shared among them. Another challenge\nin the present\
    \ system is the ability to inform the patients when their data is shared.\nWhen\
    \ there is an exchange of information between hospitals or organizations, the\n\
    users are generally unaware of the data exchange\n•\nData handling. The existing\
    \ healthcare infrastructure should be developed to process\nthe huge volumes of\
    \ data and should make sure accurate information is being collected\nfrom the\
    \ patients. Storing and collecting inaccurate healthcare information could lead\n\
    to a fatality when the patient is treated.\nTo avoid challenges, Blockchain can\
    \ be used to maintain a ﬂexible and transparent\nconsent management system. Its\
    \ immutability and decentralized features will make the\nsystem trustworthy for\
    \ the users.\n3. Overview of Blockchain\nBefore blockchain technology, transactions\
    \ were recorded using a centralized model\nthat consists of server-side and client-side\
    \ applications. In 1990, Haber, S and Stornetta,\nW. S. came up with the idea\
    \ of a secured chain of time-stamps [14]. They aspired to\ncreate a system where\
    \ the timestamps of a document cannot be tampered with. How-\never, Blockchain’s\
    \ concept earned its acclaim in 2008 when it was used as a distributed\nledger\
    \ technology in Bitcoin (Bitcoin white paper published in October 2008 [15]).\
    \ The\nmysterious Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, where we can trade electronic\
    \ coins\nwithout a centralized party (banks, for example). In a typical transaction,\
    \ a third party\nmust be involved in transferring money; third parties are not\
    \ always reliable, as there is a\nchance of them getting compromised, and there\
    \ are transfer limits as well; also, additional\namounts are charged when a third\
    \ party is involved. With the introduction of Bitcoin,\nwe can avoid these conﬁnements.\
    \ Bitcoin is a virtual currency exchange that takes place\nwithout a third party\
    \ between peers. It is immune to counterfeiting and is preserved by\ncomplex algorithms.\n\
    Around 2014, cryptocurrency exchanges were not the only application of fascinating\n\
    blockchain technology. It was explored and used in many other ﬁelds. Blockchain\
    \ uses\nthe SHA-256 algorithm to maintain the data changes in the network and\
    \ asymmetric\ncryptography to achieve enhanced security.\nHealthcare 2021, 9,\
    \ 137\n5 of 21\n3.1. Working of Blockchain\nAs mentioned earlier, Blockchain is\
    \ used to make sure the documents have not been\ntampered with, it stores the\
    \ information in terms of blocks. Usually, each block comprises\nthree things:\n\
    •\nData\n•\nHash of block\n•\nHash of the previous block\nInformation stored within\
    \ a block depends on the Blockchain type; for example, a\nbitcoin includes ﬁnancial\
    \ data (details of a transaction) stored in its blocks. The hash value\nof a block\
    \ will be generated when a block is created; its value will not be the same if\
    \ the\ndata of the block is changed and it also contains the previous block’s\
    \ hash value. As seen\nin Figure 1 below, the ﬁrst block in a blockchain is called\
    \ a Genesis Block, and it won’t have\nthe hash value of any previous block; instead,\
    \ it starts from zero.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, x  \n5 of 22 \n \n \nAround 2014,\

    As mentioned earlier, Blockchain is used to make sure the documents have not been\

    \ block comprises \nthree things: \n• \nData \n• \nHash of block \n• \nHash of\
    \ the previous block \nInformation stored within a block depends on the Blockchain\
    \ type; for example, a \nbitcoin includes financial data (details of a transaction)\
    \ stored in its blocks. The hash value \nof a block will be generated when a block\
    \ is created; its value will not be the same if the \ndata of the block is changed\
    \ and it also contains the previous block’s hash value. As seen \nin Figure 1\
    \ below, the first block in a blockchain is called a Genesis Block, and it won’t\
    \ \nhave the hash value of any previous block; instead, it starts from zero. \n\
    \ \nFigure 1. A basic block contains a hash, a previous block hash, and data.\
    \ \nWhen there is a new transaction, a block will be added with the corresponding\
    \ data. \nTherefore, a new block will be attached, and it establishes a chain\
    \ in the process, hence the \nname Blockchain. Due to its immutable property,\
    \ the data in the Blockchain cannot be \nmodified. \nIn an instance where data\
    \ is changed in a block, as the information is changed, its \nhash value also\
    \ changes. Therefore, this block’s hash value and the previous hash value \nof\
    \ the next blocks will not be the same, resulting in breaking the chain and making\
    \ it in-\nvalid, but there is a chance of recalculating the remaining block’s\
    \ hash values to make it \nvalid again with the help of advanced supercomputers;\
    \ to avoid this, we use the concept \nof proof of work. \nThe initial consensus\
    \ algorithm in a Blockchain network is the proof of work (PoW) \n[16]. PoW is\
    \ done by people who are called miners to ensure that the transactions made \n\
    are authentic. This validation method of the transactions is called mining; once\
    \ transac-\ntions are verified valid, they can be added to the Blockchain. \n\
    A smart contract is a program that can act as a protocol or an agreement, which\
    \ can-\nnot be tampered with. This concept is introduced by Nick Szabo in 1994\
    \ [17]. In the case \nof Blockchain, these play a very crucial role. Once deployed\
    \ on the network, these can be \ninvoked or triggered with the help of a unique\
    \ address that is assigned to them. Therefore, \nFigure 1. A basic block contains\
    \ a hash, a previous block hash, and data.\nWhen there is a new transaction, a\
    \ block will be added with the corresponding data.\nTherefore, a new block will\

    \ to avoid this, we use the concept of proof\nof work.\nThe initial consensus\
    \ algorithm in a Blockchain network is the proof of work (PoW) [16].\nPoW is done\
    \ by people who are called miners to ensure that the transactions made are\nauthentic.\
    \ This validation method of the transactions is called mining; once transactions\n\
    are veriﬁed valid, they can be added to the Blockchain.\nA smart contract is a\
    \ program that can act as a protocol or an agreement, which cannot\nbe tampered\

    Blockchain, these play a very crucial role. Once deployed on the network, these\
    \ can be\ninvoked or triggered with the help of a unique address that is assigned\
    \ to them. Therefore,\nwhen a smart contract is deployed, the information is stored\
    \ on the network, which is\naccessible to the nodes that are participating. The\
    \ other nodes on the network cannot\nchange the information on the smart contract.\
    \ There are many use cases of the smart\ncontract. For instance, when we want\
    \ to sell a particular object (car, house, etc.,), a potential\nbuyer can be found\
    \ on the network, thus eliminating the need for a third party. Therefore,\nsmart\
    \ contracts are self-veriﬁable. Solidity is one of the main programming languages\
    \ that\nis used to create and execute. Ethereum and Zeppelin are Blockchain platforms\
    \ that use\nthe Solidity programming language.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n6 of\
    \ 21\nThere are three crucial Blockchain types—public, private, and consortium.\
    \ All the\ntransactions are made available to the public in public Blockchain;\
    \ anyone can participate,\ncreate, or mine. Private Blockchain or permissioned\
    \ Blockchain—in this kind, users should\nhave consent to join the group, and it\
    \ is more centralized than that of public Blockchain.\nThe third kind is consortium\
    \ blockchain, and it is indistinguishable from private Blockchain,\nbut the key\
    \ difference between a private and a consortium Blockchain is in a consortium\n\
    blockchain, it is controlled or regulated by a group instead of a single person,\
    \ as is the case\nin a private Blockchain.\n3.2. Applications of Blockchain Technology\n\
    Healthcare. An important issue in the healthcare industry is the privacy of the\
    \ patients.\nPatient consent is the key point in the healthcare ecosystem. The\
    \ technology brings a more\nsecure model for patient information exchange. Considering\
    \ its distributed ledger feature,\nit provides more ease of operations between\
    \ the hospitals. It has the capability to achieve\nnationwide interoperability\
    \ between the hospitals for EHR (electronic health records).\nMedChain [18] was\
    \ introduced as a data-sharing system. In this system, the data is\ncollected\
    \ from the medical devices and sensors. There are two events that are created\
    \ on\nthe network in this model. The ﬁrst event is created when the healthcare\
    \ provider adds the\ndata to patient inventory, and the second event is created\
    \ when a patient provides access\nto the requestor. Another blockchain application\
    \ in the medical ﬁeld is [19], the proposed\ndesign is a private blockchain network\
    \ with Ethereum as its platform and a back end\ndistributed ﬁle system. In this\
    \ prototype, the smart contracts are created as a representation\nof health records\
    \ and contain metadata of the ownership, permissions, and data integrity.\nThe\
    \ prototype deals with various use cases of smart contracts such as the process\
    \ of issuing\nthe medicines, sharing the lab results with doctors, and for clinical\
    \ trials, etc.\nInternet of Things (IoT). This is will enable businesses to make\
    \ insights from data\ncollected from IoT devices, which will help them provide\
    \ improved service to the users.\nDevices such as Fitbit collect information from\
    \ the user. In the framework [20], advanced\ncryptography methods are used to\
    \ make the design secure and suitable for IoT devices.\nThe prototype deals with\
    \ off-chain storage, and data is stored on the cloud. The main idea\nis to have\
    \ the cloud servers send the hash of the data to the overlay network. When the\n\
    data is shared to the cloud, the sender adds a digital signature. The overlay\
    \ network sends\nan alert to healthcare providers. When the healthcare provider\
    \ has received an alert, they\nwill have full access to the patient’s data.\n\
    Machine Learning. An insurance company could beneﬁt from the integration of ML\n\
    and blockchain, as identity fraud can be detected before entering the details\
    \ on the network.\nIn [21], the authors have introduced an algorithm to ﬁnd the\
    \ better conﬁgurations of\nweights in a neural network using Blockchain and its\
    \ concepts. The model was developed\non a local network, where the multiple devices\
    \ are connected. Each node on the network\nwill have the same controls. Transactions\
    \ can be viewed by each node itself. This avoids\nunnecessary access to the other\
    \ nodes. Here, each demand is considered as a transaction,\nand in the event of\
    \ a conditional stopping, miners will be awarded based on the better\nresults.\n\
    3.3. Blockchain for Consent Management\nThe following comprises an effective consent\
    \ management system:\n•\nData transparency\n•\nSecure storage\n•\nAccurate data\
    \ management\nBlockchain is a decentralized network where all users have access\
    \ to the data available\non it. For instance, any transaction/movement made by\
    \ the organization can be seen\nby all users, making the process completely transparent.\
    \ Any exchanges made between\nthe organizations can be recorded and can be made\
    \ available to users so that they can\ntrack their data movement. Its decentralized\
    \ nature will make sure that systems are not\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n7 of 21\n\
    dependent on one central authority. Instead, it is distributed across the nodes\
    \ or members\non the network for various approvals or acceptance, making it more\
    \ trustworthy. The\nmost interesting and essential feature of Blockchain is its\
    \ immutability. Once a record is\nadded to the network, the consent of a user\
    \ cannot be modiﬁed. If there is a change of\nconsent, it can be added one more\
    \ time as a different block. Combining or mapping data\nfrom all sources is one\
    \ of the most difﬁcult tasks and can be done using Blockchain. Data\ncan be aggregated\
    \ in Blockchain using a distributed hash table (DHT) [22]. The encrypted\nconsent\
    \ data created by DHT can be stored on Blockchain, and the actual data can always\n\
    be retrieved easily, which also resolves the size issue of the Blockchain, as\
    \ more data cannot\nbe stored in a block.\nAnother main application of Blockchain\
    \ is identity management, where user’s data\ncan be validated by an organization.\
    \ For instance, an educational organization can validate\na student’s ﬁnal degree\
    \ and store it on Blockchain, which can also be used to validate user\ndata so\
    \ that accurate data can be collected and stored. Therefore, using Blockchain,\
    \ the\nconsent management process can be made easier and more compliant.\n4. Research\
    \ Methodology\nWe also followed the recommendations for a systematic review of\
    \ the literature [23]\nand the criteria outlined in the PRISMA statement [9].\
    \ In the ﬁrst step, we have identiﬁed\nthe critical research questions that would\
    \ help us to understand what level blockchain-\nbased technologies (related to\
    \ consent/privacy data management) were built. The ques-\ntions help us in examining\
    \ the issues and constraints. The basic steps involved in conduct-\ning a systematic\
    \ review are shown in the below Figure 2.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, x  \n8 of 22 \n\
    \ \n \nFigure 2. The process followed to conduct this review. \nDescription of\
    \ Research Objectives \nWe identified four research questions that we wanted in\
    \ the review. \nRQ1: How does Blockchain protect user privacy and data consent\
    \ across different sectors? \n• \nThis is one of the primary questions in this\
    \ research to understand how Block-\nchain is used to implement consent management\
    \ in various sectors such as \nhealthcare, education, IoT, etc. We have reviewed\
    \ multiple research papers \nand articles to understand different problems that\
    \ blockchain applications \ncould solve as PII (Personal Identifiable Information)\
    \ policies went through a \nlot of change after the introduction of GDPR. \nRQ2:\

    \ Objectives\nWe identiﬁed four research questions that we wanted in the review.\n\
    RQ1: How does Blockchain protect user privacy and data consent across different\
    \ sectors?\n•\nThis is one of the primary questions in this research to understand\
    \ how Blockchain\nis used to implement consent management in various sectors such\
    \ as healthcare,\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n8 of 21\neducation, IoT, etc. We have\
    \ reviewed multiple research papers and articles to\nunderstand different problems\
    \ that blockchain applications could solve as PII\n(Personal Identiﬁable Information)\
    \ policies went through a lot of change after\nthe introduction of GDPR.\nRQ2:\
    \ What Blockchain-based applications have been built of the described use cases?\n\
    •\nAlthough this technology was introduced in 2008 by the enigmatic Satoshi\n\
    Nakamoto as an essential technology for Bitcoin, it is still a relatively new\
    \ tech-\nnology in other sectors such as healthcare, IoT, and education. Many\
    \ application\nproposals were given in the scientiﬁc reviews, but very few discussed\
    \ the work-\ning prototypes. Therefore, it is vital to learn and understand the\
    \ real-world\nimplementations.\nRQ3: How are the limitations of current solutions\
    \ addressed?\n•\nHere our objective is to ﬁnd out the limitations of the technology\
    \ based on the\nprototypes that have been developed? We will also examine the\
    \ steps taken to\navoid such limitations.\nRQ4: What are the major challenges\
    \ for future research?\n•\nWith the introduction of GDPR rules in the EU, we have\
    \ many restrictions on the\nuse of PII. With this question, we identify the research\
    \ gaps and challenges that\nneed to be addressed so that the applications follow\
    \ the new rules and policies.\nFigure 3 shows the PRISMA ﬂow of this systematic\
    \ review.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, x  \n9 of 22\n \nFigure 3 shows the PRISMA flow\
    \ of this systematic review. \n \nFigure 3. A PRISMA flow of this systematic review.\
    \ \nIn the next step, we have searched for research papers in a reputable database\
    \ (IEEE)\nwith the keywords “Blockchain for consent management” and “Blockchain\
    \ for private\ndata management” and collected research papers. In the following\
    \ step of the filtering, we\nhave removed those documents whose title indicated\
    \ that they were not of relevance to\nthe topic. A few papers, for instance, were\
    \ about Blockchain, but not related to the field of\nconsent management. \nIn\
    \ the next step, the following exclusion criteria were used after reading the\
    \ abstract\nFigure 3. A PRISMA ﬂow of this systematic review.\nHealthcare 2021,\

    \ keywords, we have gathered 483 research papers where we ﬁltered out the\npaper\
    \ whose titles suggested that they were not relevant to the research. After this\
    \ step, we\nwere left with 254 papers of various researchers, which were combined\
    \ into a single ﬁle to\ncheck for duplicates; we found around 29 duplicate papers\
    \ and removed them from the\nlist. After reading the abstract, introduction, and\
    \ conclusion extensively, we had to remove\n152 papers, as they had nothing to\
    \ do with Blockchain for consent/privacy management.\nThe outcome was 73 papers\
    \ selected. The full list of ﬁnal papers is shown in Table 2 below.\nTable 2.\

    \ the Papers\nMost of the selected papers were conference papers, and the next\
    \ signiﬁcant type of\nselected papers are journal type papers. We have also identiﬁed\
    \ the industry sectors such\nas healthcare, IoT, identity management and storage,\
    \ to classify the use cases of the papers\nand have discussed a few main sectors\
    \ where Blockchain is implemented.\n5.2.1. Healthcare\nResearchers have identiﬁed\
    \ that the healthcare industry is one of the primary indus-\ntries that can beneﬁt\
    \ from Blockchain technology. As it follows the distributed ledger\nconcept, medical\
    \ records can be shared easily between the hospitals/doctors/researchers\nfor\
    \ various reasons, which can easily be used for managing a patient’s data. Counterfeiting\n\
    medicines are a big concern for the pharmaceutical industry [49]. Health research\
    \ funding\nstudies have shown that 10% to 30% of drugs sold in developing countries\
    \ are counter-\nfeit [96]. The WHO reports that 16% of counterfeit products have\
    \ the wrong ingredients,\nwhile 17% have an imprecise amount of necessary ingredients\
    \ [49]. The use of these can\nlead to severe health problems and sometimes cause\
    \ death. Blockchain can be used to avoid\nthis, as it is digitally timestamped,\
    \ and information cannot be changed/tampered with.\nAs stated, the main advantage\
    \ of Blockchain in the healthcare industry is that it can\nbe used to track and\
    \ manage the patient’s data. Severe diseases require a personalized\ntreatment,\
    \ and a person cannot consult a single doctor for every disease. Hence, Blockchain\n\
    is a platform where we can share this sensitive data, and we can make sure that\
    \ it is safe\nand secure. Asaph Azaria and the team have proposed a framework\
    \ called MedRec to\nshare the medical information, which also has storage solutions\
    \ [25]. They also introduced\nthe incentives concept by asking the stakeholders\
    \ to participate in the network and verify\nas miners [25]. S. Amofa also discussed\
    \ the importance of sharing the data between doctors\nand built a framework using\
    \ Ethereum [41]. In [37], Blockchain was implemented in a\ndeveloping country,\
    \ Nepal, where, with the implementation, there was a ﬁnancial gain\nof 63%.\n\
    While it is important to share the data between the organizations, it is also\
    \ important\nfor researchers to access and analyze health information. Vero Estrada-Galinanes\
    \ and K.\nWac discussed such importance in [48] and proposed the development of\
    \ an Open Health\nArchive (OHA), a shared forum for maintaining and archiving\
    \ personal health records.\nThe importance of the research in the health care\
    \ sector is discussed in the articles [75,88]\nby the respective authors. The\
    \ research articles [77,80] discussed the importance of sharing\nthe data in the\
    \ Cloud, as PII is not allowed directly in Blockchain because of GDPR, and\nthey\
    \ have also explained it with their respective working prototypes.\nThe research\
    \ papers [70,95] examined the importance of user control over the data,\nwhich\
    \ is shared, and working models have been built using Ethereum and Hyperledger\n\
    Fabric, respectively. Emergency access to health records is discussed in [50];\
    \ it can be\nachieved with help of smart contracts. The author suggested having\
    \ a smart contract that\nwill give access to information in case of an emergency\
    \ for a limited period. SHEMB is an\nEthereum-based solution that requires a third\
    \ party in storing data using a symmetrically\nsearchable encryption technique\
    \ to speed up access to information using the patient’s\nsearch query [66].\n\
    5.2.2. IoT\nThis is another ﬁeld where Blockchain implementation can revolutionize\
    \ the world.\nIoT applications are those that are connected to the Internet and\
    \ can communicate with\neach other. Though there are many advantages of IoT devices,\
    \ the main concern is that\nthey collect sensitive information like our location,\
    \ etc., and they can be used to make or\nunderstand the behavioral patterns of\
    \ a user. Therefore, Blockchain technology integration\nwith IoT devices will\
    \ result in privacy issues being nulliﬁed.\nThe papers [26,45] discussed the implementation\
    \ of Blockchain in the IoT ﬁeld and\nthe limitations that come along with it.\
    \ Cha, S.C. and others have suggested the design\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n14\
    \ of 21\nof a blockchain linked gateway that preserves user privacy preferences\
    \ for IoT devices\non the blockchain network adaptively and securely [45].To make\
    \ sure the IoT data is\nsecure, Fariza Sabrina came up with a solution that discusses\
    \ the privacy data challenge.\nAn approach is a service-oriented approach and\
    \ a mix of public Blockchain (with smart\ncontracts) and local off-chain data\
    \ for entitlement management and control [56]. The\narchitecture is implemented\
    \ using Ethereum and helps to secure conﬁdential data. In\nthe article authored\
    \ by [53], the paper discusses the importance of trust while integrating\nBlockchain\
    \ and IoT. Here, the implementation is done using Ethereum Framework, and the\n\
    decentralized network is laid between the patient, insurance provider, and hospital\
    \ instead\nof a traditional centralized network. The main disadvantage of a centralized\
    \ network is\nthat it is a time taking process, and there is no proper transparency.\n\
    5.2.3. Identity Management\nUsually, personal identity is veriﬁed using documents\
    \ such as Social Number, license,\nand passport. However, there is hardly an efﬁcient\
    \ equivalent method for protecting\nonline identities [49]. Using Blockchain,\
    \ a digital identity/ID can be created and can be\nused for online transactions\
    \ instead of using real identities. This way, we can eliminate\nthe possibility\
    \ of online fraud. Blockchain-based identity management solutions may\nallow customers\
    \ to access and validate online purchases by simply using an authentication\n\
    app instead of using a username and password or biometric system [97]. Additionally,\n\
    the self-sovereign identity concept in Blockchain is introduced by D. Baars to\
    \ eliminate\nidentity theft [98]. A new way of storing important documents related\
    \ to education is\nexplained by Alan Colman and the team in [34], and it is implemented\
    \ using Ethereum.\nThe author proposed a framework that can store the data and\
    \ authenticate the education-\nrelated documents where the authentication of documents\
    \ is done by the University or\nCollege and stored on the Blockchain. As the data\
    \ in Blockchain cannot be tampered with,\nwe can always request authentication.\
    \ Paul Dunphy et al. introduced a framework for\nidentity management, using distributed\
    \ ledger technology to improve decentralization,\naccountability, and user control\
    \ [36].\n5.2.4. Storage\nThough direct PII cannot be stored in a Blockchain network,\
    \ this can be used to store\nencrypted data. One of the main applications of Blockchain\
    \ is the ability to combine with\nthird parties like Cloud, etc., to store the\
    \ data. This enables users to have data transparency\nand the ability to track\
    \ the usage of their data. In [68], they introduced a new technique\ncalled interest\
    \ groups, where each group will hold to a ﬁeld data. Now the groups can\nsell/borrow/rent\
    \ the data that they hold. They also spoke about the rewards that could be\ngiven\
    \ for a group that offers the most relevant data. Data transparency is the main\
    \ feature.\nAs stated before, the size of a block and GDPR make it difﬁcult to\
    \ store data on Blockchain.\nTherefore, Saqib Ali and others came up with the\
    \ idea of Pinger [42]. It stores the metadata\nof the ﬁles, while the original\
    \ ﬁles are stored in various locations with the aid of a DHT\n(distributed hash\
    \ table). Using Ethereum and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), M. Alessi\nand\
    \ the team came up with a prototype [34], which can store personal data and also\
    \ has\nrequested data service.\nThese are the main classiﬁcations that we found\
    \ in the process. There are other\nﬁelds like agriculture, where Blockchain is\
    \ used. The importance of farmer’s consent\nusing Blockchain is mentioned in [99].\
    \ Consentio [100] is a general consent management\nsystem that is built on Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric that can be used for various cases such as EHR\n(Health), small infrastructure\
    \ (IoT), and social media. Few papers also discussed the main\napplications, challenges,\
    \ and issues [27,60,63,64,81].\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n15 of 21\n6. Discussion\n\
    In this section, we utilize our ﬁndings to cross-examiner the research questions\
    \ we\nhave identiﬁed in Section 4. We provide a discussion of our analysis and\
    \ address the\nlimitations of the review.\nRQ1: How does Blockchain protect user\
    \ privacy and data consent across various sectors?\nBlockchain is used in various\
    \ types of industries—healthcare, IoT, Identity Manage-\nment, etc. The most common\
    \ use cases are mentioned below in Table 3.\nTable 3. Use cases in various sectors.\n\
    Field\nUsage\nHealthcare\nTo share the medical information securely between\n\
    doctors/organizations/researchers\nIoT\nTo have the user’s privacy preference\
    \ for IoT Devices\nIdentity Management\nManagement of identity veriﬁcation\nStorage\n\
    Tamper-proof activity monitoring and data access control protection\nRQ2: What\
    \ Blockchain-based applications have been built of the described use cases?\n\
    Although the concept of Blockchain was introduced in 2008, it is still a new technology\n\
    for other sectors except for Finance. Many of the papers presented technical implementa-\n\
    tion; very few papers had a practical implementation, and few of those details\
    \ are given in\nTable 4.\nTable 4. Existing applications.\nField\nApplication\n\
    Healthcare\nMedRec [25], SHEMB [66]\nIoT\nBlockchain-enabled Security Architecture\
    \ [56]\nIdentity Management\nBlockchain as a Notarization Service [34]\nStorage\n\
    Pinger [42], Pledge [68]\nOut of the implementations that have been developed,\
    \ we have observed that Ethereum\nis the most used framework, and it is followed\
    \ by Hyperledger Fabric. The concept of\nSmart Contracts in Ethereum is one of\
    \ the main reasons it is the most used Framework.\nRQ3: How are the limitations\
    \ of current solutions addressed?\nThe main challenges are interoperability, block\
    \ size, regulations, response time, and\nthe GDPR rule “right to be forgotten”.\
    \ Interoperability is a big challenge that is being\nfaced, as we cannot operate\
    \ between two frameworks, and the integration of Blockchain\nwith legacy systems\
    \ is still an issue. After interoperability, the size of the network is a\nconcern,\
    \ as the Bitcoin network is around 270 GB, and Ethereum size already crossed 1\n\
    TB [101]. The main challenge with the size of these networks is the transaction\
    \ speed and\nvalidation process. Due to the increasing size of the networks, the\
    \ main challenge is to the\nvalidators/contributors who need to spend more money\
    \ to make their nodes run. Not only\nthe cost but also the response time of the\
    \ network is impacted due to this. Now bigger\nblocks are very much challenging\
    \ to running the network, whereas smaller blocks are\nfeasible to run and work\
    \ well with a third-party solution like Cloud. As a decentralized\nsystem, it\
    \ does not have standard regulations making it vulnerable. Coming to another\n\
    challenge in Blockchain technology is the GDPR rules that were introduced in 2018\
    \ to\nprotect the PII of European Nations. It means that a person is entitled\
    \ to ask the data to be\nerased. But Blockchain being immutable, it is impossible\
    \ to erase data from the network.\nFinally, there are a few security concerns\
    \ with the existing applications. A potential breach\ncould leak all the user’s\
    \ data, as there have been several attacks on certain Blockchain\napplications.\
    \ There is also a risk of identifying a user when there is adequate information\n\
    available on the network.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n16 of 21\nThere are few networks\
    \ such as Cosmos [102] and Polkadot [103] that came up with\nthe solution for\
    \ interoperability. As a part of the Cosmos network, independent networks\n(called\
    \ zones) are connected through the Cosmos Hub. Additionally, Ethereum 2 (also\n\
    known as Serenity) solves a few critical issues with the introduction of concepts\
    \ such as\nsubchain and POS (Proof of Stake) [104]. These features now enable\
    \ a person to maintain\nsmall transactions without mining, which reduces the bloating\
    \ problem. With the help\nof the subchain, now the transactions will be cheaper\
    \ and quicker. Additionally, the 51%\npercent attack can be avoided with the POS\
    \ concept, as a person/miner with more than 51\npercent of control would not want\
    \ to attack their network. Additionally, erasing data from\nlocal storage is possible,\
    \ as we do not store the PII on the network. This has been explained\nby M. Florian\
    \ in [63]. The author suggested an approach where we can completely delete\nthe\
    \ undesirable data from local nodes. By this, we can ensure the GDPR rule, which\
    \ is\nthe right to be forgotten. Additionally, only a few nodes can participate\
    \ in the consensus\nand validation processes to boost the efﬁciency of the system\
    \ and increase the processing\nspeed [105]. Currently, more extensive research\
    \ is going to improve the current standards\nand conditions of Blockchain technology\
    \ to make it more useful. Permissioned Blockchain\nshould be used instead of the\
    \ public Blockchains to avoid attacks and sharing of the data.\nTo protect the\
    \ user information on the network, encryption technologies are being used,\nand\
    \ techniques are also to be updated periodically.\nRQ4: What are the major challenges\
    \ for future research?\nBlockchain solves many real-world problems, such as data\
    \ authentication, data storage,\nand data privacy. It is still in the early stages\
    \ of implementation, as there are not many\nworking prototypes at this moment.\
    \ Therefore, extensive research is going in every ﬁeld\nto implement this technology,\
    \ especially in the ﬁeld of data management, as we believe\nthat it can eliminate\
    \ the process of ﬁlling up forms, as the data can be shared between any\ndepartments/organizations\
    \ securely. More working models are needed to come up with\nthe best practice\
    \ to implement for managing the data; for this reason, the prototypes must\nbe\
    \ tested thoroughly. We believe it will play a crucial role in the future healthcare,\
    \ IoT, data\nstorage, identity management, and Telecom sectors, respectively.\
    \ Additionally, to make\nsure the new working prototypes are approachable to the\
    \ people, there is a need for a few\nregulations to be introduced.\nOne of the\
    \ main focuses is also on the interoperability of the frameworks. Apart from\n\
    interoperability, the other main challenges that need to be worked upon are security\
    \ and\nprivacy; the speed of adding blocks to a network is one constant area that\
    \ also needs to be\nchecked. These are a few areas where there are open research\
    \ questions. It is also highly\nessential that Blockchain complies with all the\
    \ regulations set by GDPR. By meeting all the\nrequirements, it will give a boost\
    \ to the companies to integrate into their existing solutions.\nLimitations of\
    \ the Review\nDespite the various beneﬁts of conducting a systematic analysis,\
    \ certain drawbacks\nneed to be considered: bias in the collection, bias in publication,\
    \ imprecision in the extrac-\ntion of data, and misclassiﬁcation [23]. To eliminate\
    \ the bias, we investigated the papers\nirrespective of novelty or unremarkable\
    \ outcomes. To achieve a maximum possible number\nof papers, an efﬁcient search\
    \ protocol was developed for research papers, followed by a\nsearch with all alternative\
    \ keywords. Moreover, criteria for inclusion and exclusion have\nbeen established\
    \ to ensure that the papers included are focused on research topics that are\n\
    well linked to the research goals.\nInaccuracies in the extraction of data and\
    \ misjudgments may be attributed to the\nreviewer’s failure to accurately retrieve\
    \ information and data from its records. We have\nused an Excel sheet throughout\
    \ the process to make sure all the extracted data have been\nproperly recorded.\n\
    Healthcare 2021, 9, 137\n17 of 21\n7. Conclusions and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ is an evolving technology that will revolutionize the information technol-\n\
    ogy world, because it can be applied in many applications domains where an immutable\n\
    ledger is useful. To evaluate the applications of blockchain to consent management\
    \ and\nprivate data management, we have conducted this systematic review using\
    \ the PRISMA\nguidelines to identify the current solutions, limitations and research\
    \ challenges. Overall, 73\npapers were studied in detail to perform this review.\n\
    Our study indicates that Blockchain has been implemented in various ﬁelds such\
    \ as\nhealthcare, IoT, data storage, and management. Many prototypes have been\
    \ developed and\nare already tested in real-world scenarios. More research is\
    \ being conducted on this, and in\nthe future, more research will be done to understand\
    \ and evaluate the implementations.\nFurther research is aimed at solving the\
    \ issues associated with the use of blockchain\ntechnology such as scalability,\
    \ latency, interoperability, privacy, and security.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original\

    Abstract: With opportunities brought by Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite\
    \ a challenge to assure\nprivacy preservation when a huge number of resource-constrained\
    \ distributed devices is involved.\nBlockchain has become popular for its beneﬁts,\
    \ including decentralization, persistence, immutability,\nauditability and consensus.\
    \ With the implementation of blockchain in IoT, the beneﬁts provided by\nblockchain\
    \ can be derived in order to make IoT more efﬁcient and maintain trust. In this\
    \ paper, we\ndiscuss some applications of IoT in different ﬁelds and privacy-related\
    \ issues faced by IoT in resource-\nconstrained devices. We discuss some applications\
    \ of blockchain in vast majority of areas, and the\nopportunities it brings to\
    \ resolve IoT privacy limitations. We, then, survey different researches based\n\
    on the implementation of blockchain in IoT. The goal of this paper is to survey\
    \ recent researches\nbased on the implementation of blockchain in IoT for privacy\
    \ preservation. After analyzing the\nrecent solutions, we see that the blockchain\
    \ is an optimal way for preventing identity disclosure,\nmonitoring, and providing\
    \ tracking in IoT.\nKeywords: blockchain; consensus; IoT; smart contracts; bitcoin\n\
    1. Introduction\nWith the recent advancements in the ﬁeld of Information Technology,\
    \ a complex\nsystem called IoT evolved. It consists of several computing devices\
    \ connected with each\nother through Internet and able to process and transfer\
    \ data among each other with minimal\nhuman interaction needed. This system grew\
    \ rapidly as the devices kept increasing and\nnumber of links increased automatically.\
    \ Cisco Inc. predicted 50 billion devices by 2020,\nand it is still growing. IoT\
    \ applications are increasing the level of convenience and efﬁciency\nin everyday\
    \ life at low costs. For example, home automation and healthcare systems. An\n\
    overview of IoT is given in Section 2.\nHowever, with huge growth in the number\
    \ of devices in IoT, the challenges also\nkeep increasing. IoT devices can be\
    \ as small as a watch; apart from processing, storage\nand networking limitations\
    \ faced by such IoT devices, security is a serious concern of\nresearchers and\
    \ technicians. The growing number of devices makes attack surface broader.\nThese\
    \ security and privacy issues make IoT less trustworthy for organizations that\
    \ have\nsensitive data and maintaining customer’s privacy and data security are\
    \ their top priorities.\nAlso it becomes hard to manage a large number of devices\
    \ and to have an consensus\nbetween them.\nIoT’s privacy and security with interconnected\
    \ devices causes security challenges in\nthe area of network computing. It means\
    \ at any moment from anywhere, an attack can be\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10141732\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n2 of 26\n\
    launched on these devices that includes threats like denial of service, fabrication\
    \ of identity,\nphysical threats, communication channel targeting and many more.\
    \ One of the biggest\nchallenges in this research ﬁeld is consumption of power\
    \ resources and computational\noverheads on IoT devices. Many solutions have been\
    \ proposed by the researchers in which\nstrategies based on blockchain, homomorphic\
    \ encryption, and attribute-based encryption\nare provided.\nThe exchange of data\
    \ among physically connected devices related to their infras-\ntructure and behaviors\
    \ in the form of groups is known as IoT. From the Gartner report\nshown in Table\
    \ 1, it was expected that almost 5.8 Billion interconnected devices would be\n\
    having a vast share in market of $3 trillion in 2020 [1], while the forecasts\
    \ of international\ndata co-operation report that the expected market value of\
    \ IoT devices is $1.1 trillion for\n2023—the market of full stack systems, like\
    \ RIOT [2] and Contiki [3] that enabled IoT\ndevices functionality, is also expected\
    \ to expand.\nTable 1. IoT endpoint market by segment, 2018–2020, worldwide (in\

    \ in various domains. IoT devices play a\nhuge role in different aspects of life,\
    \ for example security, energy, safety, healthcare, smart\ngrid, VANETs, industry\
    \ and entertainment, but in terms of battery power, network proto-\ncol, complex\
    \ computation and infrequent connectivity, these devices are fundamentally\nconstrained\
    \ in resources.\nIoT bears the risk of not having a standard security scheme implementation,\
    \ which\nresults in security concerns like data misuse [2,3]. IoT devices collect\
    \ personal information\nof a user such as his identity, contact number, energy\
    \ consumed, and location. These\ndevices also reveal a user’s behavior, by collecting\
    \ information about his lifestyle and\ndaily activities—including watching movies,\
    \ playing games, home activities, gatherings,\netc. Therefore, the exposure of\
    \ the user’s personal data to non-trusted private and public\nservers can pose\
    \ serious privacy-related issues, and the data gathered by these devices\ncan\
    \ be misused against the user. These threats make it crucial to focus on the security\
    \ and\nprivacy designs of IoT devices.\nSince the application of blockchain in\
    \ bitcoin cryptocurrency [4], it has become quite\npopular. Blockchain is being\
    \ deployed in a large number of ﬁelds, such as education,\nhealthcare, banking,\
    \ agriculture, etc., for the opportunities that it brings.\nOne of the most important\
    \ features of blockchain is decentralization. It is also used\nas a consensus\
    \ mechanism to enable trust between all parties involved in decentralized\nnetworks,\
    \ one example is cryptocurrency—for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum. IoT devices\n\
    are decentralized and hence can be beneﬁted by the blockchain.\nThere are many\
    \ survey papers recently published that cover various aspects of\nblockchain in\
    \ different environments [5–9]. Bitcoin overview was presented in [6] by\nSankar\
    \ et al. [7], in which challenges related to blockchain research are presented.\
    \ Re-\ncently, in [10], an overview of blockchain-based IoT applications is presented.\
    \ In [11],\na comprehensive discussion about blockchain applications and framework\
    \ implementa-\ntions has been presented by Gao et al. The authors in [12] provide\
    \ smart contract-based\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n3 of 26\nblockchain-dependent\
    \ banking ledgers transactions overview. In many smart applications\nimplementing\
    \ blockchain, a systematic survey was provided in [13]. An overview of\nblockchain\
    \ security services like conﬁdentiality, privacy, access control and authentication\n\
    has been given by Salman et al. in [14].\nMany surveys on IoT security and Privacy-related\
    \ issues and their solutions have been\npublished. An analysis of privacy issues\
    \ in IoT is given by Ziegeldorf et al. in [15]. The\nfocus of this survey is on\
    \ classiﬁcation of privacy and security challenges in IoT devices.\nThe challenges\
    \ faced by industrial IoT devices are introduced by Sadeghi et al. in [16].\n\
    In [17], security-related challenges and their solutions are discussed. The authors\
    \ have\ncategorized security-related issues in mobile devices based on authenticity,\
    \ conﬁdentiality,\ntrust, security, and access control. The ongoing research challenges\
    \ and their status is\ndiscussed by Suo et al. [18]. Privacy preservation mechanisms\
    \ based on encryption have\nalso been discussed and some mechanisms are developed\
    \ for private communication.\nMany solutions have been proposed by the researchers\
    \ recently for integration of\nblockchain in different IoT applications. The integration\
    \ of blockchain with IoT and the\npros and cons of this integration are examined\
    \ by Christidis and Devetsikiotis in [19], and\nAtzori et al. in [20], whereas\
    \ a comprehensive survey on IoT applications is presented\nin [21] by Conoscenti\
    \ et al. For IoT decentralization, certain challenges and solutions are\nprovided\
    \ by the authors. In [22], blockchain-based IoT research opportunities, challenges\n\
    and different architectures are discussed by Reyna et al. In [23], blockchain-based\
    \ IoT with\nedge centric technology solutions have been discuss by Yeow et al.\
    \ For security and privacy\nin blockchain-based IoT, a survey is presented in\
    \ [10] by Fernendaz et al. A research done\nby Panarello et al. involves smart\
    \ grid and smart cities in [24].\nRecently, a survey on publicly deployed blockchain\
    \ on different network principals\nhas been provided by Neudecker and Hartenstein,\
    \ in which design trade-offs of public\nblockchain and potential attacks are also\
    \ presented [25]. The privacy issues in blockchain\nand their solutions are presented\
    \ in [26,27]. The authors provided literature review com-\nprehensively on privacy\
    \ aspects of blockchain with their solution strategies and presented\na zero knowledge\
    \ proof, signature and cryptographic approaches analysis in [26]. Whereas\nin\
    \ [27], Feng et al. presented privacy issues insights in a detailed manner, technical\
    \ details\nsummary and different defence mechanism were analyzed.\nIn this paper,\
    \ we survey the deployment of blockchain in constrained IoT devices in\norder\
    \ to achieve privacy and security.\nIn Section 2, we present an overview of IoT,\
    \ its applications and privacy-related\nchallenges. We present an overview of\
    \ blockchain technology in Section 3, and we highlight\nsome applications and\
    \ strengths of blockchain. In the same section, We highlight different\nconsensus\
    \ mechanisms used by blockchain, and smart contracts that come with it. A\nreview\
    \ of applications of blockchain in IoT is presented in Section 4. At different\
    \ layers of\nIoT, privacy mechanisms and issues are analyzed. Future challenges\
    \ and their solutions\nare provided in Section 6. The conclusion of our paper\
    \ is provided in Section 5. Future\ndirections are given in Section 6.\nAll the\
    \ researches highlighted above have mainly discussed strengths and limitations\n\
    of either blockchain or IoT. Many researches are based on the integration of blockchain\n\
    in IoT to achieve consensus, decentralization, or smart contracts. While there\
    \ are a huge\nnumber of surveys that discuss the security parameters, such as\
    \ integrity, non-repudiation,\ntransparency and immutability, provided by blockchain\
    \ to IoT, this survey focuses mainly\non privacy preservation in resource-constrained\
    \ IoT devices using blockchain. In this\nsurvey, we present state-of-the-art literature\
    \ on privacy preservation assurance in IoT using\nblockchain. Contributions of\
    \ this survey, as compared to other surveys, are as follows.\n•\nWe highlight\
    \ some applications of IoT in different ﬁelds and see how much it impacts\nour\
    \ lives and how crucial it is to preserve user privacy in IoT.\n•\nWe highlight\

    \ formed by the connection of multiple uniquely identiﬁed devices, such\nas computers,\
    \ smartphones, sensors, software, cars, vending machines, thermostats, etc., to\n\
    process and share data without the need of a human interaction. It relies on the\
    \ Internet for\ncommunication purposes among these devices [28] to keep the data\
    \ synchronized. The\ndevices can be controlled remotely to perform desired actions.\n\
    Kevin Ashton used the term “Internet for things” for the ﬁrst time in 1999. Originally\n\
    it was called “Internet for things” and then it became “Internet of things”. Since\
    \ then, this\nframework became popular for the convenience it brought into everyday\
    \ life. Today there\nare billions of IoT devices operating in a large number of\
    \ ﬁelds (Figure 1). Although it is\nnot feasible to discuss all applications of\
    \ IoT, but Figure 1 shows some ﬁelds, including\nmilitary [29,30], industry [31],\
    \ smart cities [32], consumer [33], security [34] and home\nautomation [35], and\
    \ respective IoT applications. With time, IoT has become more human-\nfriendly\
    \ by processing large amounts of data with minimal human efforts put. Today IoT\
    \ is\nnot just limited to the personal use, but it is being used to detect weather,\
    \ monitor surgeries,\nmanage energy, monitor environment and manage transportation.\n\
    Figure 1. Applications of IoT.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n5 of 26\n2.2. Characteristics\
    \ of IoT\n•\nIntelligence: A lot of IoT devices are set to perform some speciﬁc\
    \ actions when\nneed arises, such as generating an alarm when a wearable sensor\
    \ senses a high blood\npressure for a patient. The decisions taken by a certain\
    \ device depend on the sensitivity.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning\
    \ are making IoT devices smarter.\n•\nComplexity: There is a huge number of devices,\
    \ links, and actors in IoT, that keep\nincreasing on a rapid rate.\n•\nHeterogeneity:\
    \ The devices are different from each other on the basis of hardware,\nsoftware\
    \ and networks.\n•\nConnectivity: The devices in IoT are connected with each other\
    \ through Internet to\nshare data. For example, the sensors used to collect patient\
    \ data on regular intervals\nneed to transmit this data to the concerned medical\
    \ personnel [36]. The state of data\nand devices keep changing. Therefore, it\
    \ is important to keep the devices synchronized.\n•\nInteroperability: The IoT\
    \ devices are different from each other in nature but yet\ncompatible when it\
    \ comes to performing the tasks that involve the use of multiple\ndevices at the\
    \ same time.\n•\nDecentralization: IoT comprises of billions of devices connected\
    \ with each other using\nthe Internet throughout the globe. No one “owns” IoT.\
    \ The elements such as access,\ncontrol and ownership are spread across the actors/nodes\
    \ that make up IoT.\n2.3. Privacy-Related Issues in IoT\nThe environment saturation\
    \ with smart objects to perform daily tasks is provided\nby IoT. Sensors, micro\
    \ controllers and transmitters that exchange and transmit data refer\nto nonstandard\
    \ networking devices, which enable decision making support and smart\ninteractions.\
    \ For the collection and exchange of surroundings’ data in industrial and\nconsumer’s\
    \ devices, IoT is planted. IoT is remotely controlled via Internet or directly,\n\
    which causes physical environmental changes. The safeguard protection techniques\
    \ and\ncollection of data in IoT are much lower than the momentum at which the\
    \ devices are\ndeveloped for customer use.\n2.3.1. IoT Device Limitations\nResource\
    \ constrained devices have a certain capability of weight, size and network\n\
    connection, which directly impacts the complexity of IoT devices in data rates,\
    \ unreliable\nlinks, packet sizes and power consumption. Many challenges in IoT\
    \ environment are\npointed out by various scholars.\nThe main challenge is preserving\
    \ user privacy and their employed status with other\nconnected smart objects.\
    \ The smart objects that IoT uses are continuously producing data,\nit becomes\
    \ more complex as these objects become anonymous. The objects’ interaction\nwith\
    \ each other is one the most important aspects of IoT security.\nA privacy preservation\
    \ approach in a multiple IoT scheme has been proposed by\nthe Serena et al. in\
    \ [37], which prevents feature disclosure. The approach is based on\nt-closeness\
    \ and k-anonymity notions from the database theory. These two notions derive\n\
    group’s robustness from privacy expectations. It prevents feature disclosure as\
    \ well as\ninformation disclosure. Their scheme also protects from disruptive\
    \ effects that occur from\nthe malicious objects analysis. The key point in this\
    \ paper is multi-network representation\nwhich depends on the correspondence on\
    \ network of every identiﬁed group. In terms\nof node, every object can be modeled.\
    \ Same group relationships between objects inside\nthe present communication network\
    \ are known as inner arcs, while in different group\nrelationships they are known\
    \ as cross arcs.\nSome statistics of compromised IoT are given in Table 2. Shodan\
    \ [38], Zoomeye and\nCensys are popular search engines for IoT devices vulnerabilities.\
    \ The observations made\nby authors regarding IoTs include host-based approaches\
    \ being more vulnerable than\nnetwork-based in IoT platform, and traditional security\
    \ measures for IoT devices are not\nproperly secure. The main challenge is that\
    \ the devices are resource constrained. Other\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n6 of\
    \ 26\nthan blockchain, many solutions have also been proposed for privacy preservation\
    \ in IoT,\nincluding holochain [39,40], machine learning [41,42], IOTA [43,44],\
    \ and intrusion detection\nsystem [45].\nTable 2. Statistics of broken IoT [38].\n\

    \ Impact on IoT\nIn the design of IoT protocols, heterogeneity plays a vital role.\
    \ Interaction of resource-\nconstrained IoT devices such as cloudlets, web servers\
    \ and blockchain either involve\ngateways or direct communication. The lightweight\
    \ security mechanisms need to be imple-\nmented for secure end-to-end communication,\
    \ as access policy and data summarization\nrelated mechanisms that enable transparency\
    \ are controlling our lives silently. Figure 2\nshows heterogeneous structure\
    \ of IoT. It includes four layers; sensors, networks, cloud\nservers and consumer\
    \ applications.\nFigure 2. Heterogeneous IoT structure.\n•\nSensing: In this layer,\
    \ the architecture of IoT provides sensing information for cloud\ncomputing to\
    \ make appropriate decisions by recording and monitoring user data\nwith the help\
    \ of different kind of sensors e.g. color, camera, motion, ﬂame, etc. Node\nlocation\
    \ leakage is one vulnerability in such kind of heterogeneous IoT which can be\n\
    address by smart sensor nodes.\n•\nNetworking: For forwarding data from source\
    \ to destination, network layer is respon-\nsible in heterogeneous IoT. Due to\
    \ which, higher transmission rates are provided by\nthe network models like hybrid,\
    \ star, mesh, and tree networks. The transmission of\ndata through super nodes\
    \ and relay units to cloud servers is done by network mod-\nels. They also manage\
    \ efﬁcient construction mechanisms. Data throughput, energy\nconsumption and malicious\
    \ attacks are the limitations of network models.\n•\nCloud Computing: Heterogeneous\
    \ IoT is accurately handling the large amounts of\ndata with cloud computing.\
    \ Its main function is to receive and transmit data to and\nfrom other architecture\
    \ layers [46]. Strong analytical computing, storage of data,\nElectronics 2021,\
    \ 10, 1732\n7 of 26\nemergency response strategies and efﬁcient decision making\
    \ are the advantages of\ncloud computing.\n2.4. Applications\nThe applications\
    \ of IoT range from healthcare to smart homes. The rapidly growing\nnumber of\
    \ IoT applications makes it a technology that changes the way things work.\nAuthors\
    \ in [47] discuss key technologies of industry 14.0, including IIoT. The structure\n\
    of IIoT technology is shown, including four layers; sensing layer, network layer,\
    \ service\nlayer and interface layer. Authors show that IIoT requires real-time\
    \ data availability and\nhigh reliability, unlike IoT, to increase product efﬁciency.\n\
    2.5. IoT’s Security Mechanism Deployment\nTo preserve Conﬁdentiality, infrastructure,\
    \ data integrity, security and privacy, strong\nsecurity mitigation mechanisms\
    \ are required. Figure 3 shows trends of methods used\nby researchers for countermeasures\
    \ and mitigation of attacks in IoT. Figure 3 shows that\nauthentication is most\
    \ popular security technique which is used by 49%, almost half of\nother techniques\
    \ altogether, trust management is second most popular technique due to\ndetection\
    \ and prevention abilities while blockchain is the last.\nFigure 3. IoT security\
    \ publications (2016–June 2018) in Elsevier, IEEE, Hindawi and Springer [48].\n\
    3. Blockchain\n3.1. Overview\nIn recent years, we have seen that the IoT’s potential\
    \ of delivering services is increasing\nin several sectors by using different\
    \ kinds of domains. The data transfer among a huge\nnumber of IoT devices is a\
    \ major challenge. Recently blockchain [5,49,50] has been covering\nall the major\
    \ areas of IoT with trustful and anonymous transactions in decentralized\nenvironment.\

    Privacy protection\n*\nIoT with blockchain integration beneﬁts the users with\
    \ decentralized nature of re-\nsources, low operational cost and robust behavior.\
    \ Blockchain, a technology based on\ndistributed ledger, initially developed for\
    \ cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, provides integrity,\nimmutability, decentralization,\
    \ transparency and pseudonymity. Satoshi Nakamato [4] in\n2008 introduced the\
    \ bitcoin technology using blockchain. Since then, blockchain gained\nattention\
    \ for decentralized nature of data sharing and distributed network of computing.\n\
    Through adoption of cryptographic technology with decentralized control and storage\
    \ of\ndata in the system, controlling attacks can be avoided.\nDue to uniqueness\
    \ and advanced features like immutability, integrity, transparency,\nauthorization,\
    \ auditability and transactional privacy, blockchain has been used in different\n\
    sectors before cryptocurrencies. Identity management[69], mobile crowd sensing\
    \ [70],\nInternet of energy [11,71–73], agriculture [74], supply chain management\
    \ and industry\n4.0 [75,76] are some areas of it.\nFigure 4 shows the structure\
    \ of blockchain, which is a combination of different blocks\nlinking together\
    \ in a linear fashion. In a peer-to-peer network of blockchain nodes, digital\n\
    signed transactions are maintained in a public ledger. Two types of keys are used\
    \ in\nblockchain, public key is used for encryption of data while the corresponding\
    \ private key is\nused to decrypt the ciphertext. A user also uses private key\
    \ for signing and public key for\nunique addressing. Transaction broadcasting\
    \ and signing are done at the initial stage. When\ntransaction is received by\
    \ the peers, validation of transaction and its dissemination over the\nnetwork\
    \ takes place. To achieve consensus, validation of the newly issued transactions\
    \ is\ndone by all the nodes present in the network. Miners act like special nodes\
    \ in a distributed\nconsensus that participate in transaction issuance. The block,\
    \ once generated, is broadcast\nby the miners in the network. In this way, every\
    \ node in the network has a copy of the\ntransaction and can verify it. Veriﬁcation\
    \ only involves computing a hash, which is not\ncomputationally expensive as opposed\
    \ to transaction generation, this is why any node in\nthe network can verify a\
    \ transaction.\nBlockchain is divided into three categories, public blockchain,\
    \ which is permission-\nless, private blockchain, which is permissioned and consortium\
    \ blockchain, which is a\ncombination of both. All types provide immunity against\
    \ malicious and faulty ledger\nusers. Table 4 shows properties of all four types\
    \ of blockchain. Their detailed example is\npresented in [10] by T. M. Fernández\
    \ et al. Strengths of blockchain include accuracy, cost\nreduction, decentralization,\
    \ efﬁciency, immutability, transparency and privacy.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n\

    \ Nowadays, in industries [77], investments are made in a huge amounts.\nTechnical\
    \ issues and challenges related to blockchain technology are gaining signiﬁcant\n\
    interest of researchers. Some challenges include forking, consensus protocol targeting,\
    \ 51%\nvulnerability and problems with the creation of new blockchain [78]. Another\
    \ important\nchallenge is the huge amount of power required for blockchain maintenance.\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1732\n10 of 26\n3.2. Applications\nBlockchain is being used\
    \ in a number of ﬁelds in our everyday life. Some of the\napplications are discussed\
    \ here.\nFigure 5 shows some applications of blockchain in different ﬁelds, including\
    \ IoT,\nhealthcare, ﬁnance, agriculture and cryptocurrency.\nIn IoT, blockchain\
    \ is used to secure smart appliances [79,80] and supply chain man-\nagement [81].\
    \ In healthcare, applications of blockchain include medical supply chain [82],\n\
    drug traceability [83], secure record keeping [84], patient identity validation\
    \ [85] and smart\ncontracts [86,87]. In ﬁnance industry, the blockchain solutions\
    \ include insurance [88],\npayments [89], asset management [90] and real estate\
    \ management in smart cities [91].\nIn agriculture industry, some of blockchain\
    \ applications include food supply chain [92],\nagriculture insurance [93] and\
    \ smart farming [94,95]. Cryptoccurrency applications of\nblockchain include bitcoin\
    \ and ethereum.\nFigure 5. Applications of Blockchain.\nAlthough it is infeasible\
    \ to discuss all applications, we describe some of the most\nimportant applications\
    \ of blockchain in the following subsections.\n3.2.1. Banking\nAs blockchain ensures\
    \ secure storage and immutability, it makes exchanging of funds\nmore secure.\
    \ Transactions, using blockchain, become transparent and private.\nIn [96], the\
    \ authors have discussed the strengths of blockchain integration in com-\nmercial\
    \ banking. This research analyzes the advantages for different aspects, including\n\
    overseas payments, billing operations and asset security. The authors have concluded\n\
    that the blockchain technology has the potential to decrease transaction costs\
    \ and provide\nbetter efﬁciency.\nA theoretical model is proposed in [97] in order\
    \ to analyze the pattern, which allows\nenterprises to assess bank loans using\
    \ blockchain. The authors demonstrate that blockchain\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n\
    11 of 26\nallows consensus regarding the debt payments and other activities including\
    \ lending\nand borrowing. This results in low-risk and high-quality of a small\
    \ and medium sized\nenterprise’s credibility.\nIn [98], Wang et al. proposed a\
    \ model called IBPS (Inter-Bank Payment System)\nthat utilizes Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ enterprise blockchain technology. The proposed model\nprovides efﬁciency and\
    \ secure payment services.\n3.2.2. Healthcare\nHealthcare industry is beneﬁting\
    \ from blockchain in many ways. Medical records\ncan be stored in blockchain to\
    \ be made more secure. The interaction among different\nIoT devices and wearable\
    \ sensors is crucial in healthcare systems. There are systems that\nimmediately\
    \ notify the medical personnel upon an “event”. An example of this event could\n\
    be high sugar in a patient detected by a device that she is wearing.\nThe advantages\
    \ of using blockchain in healthcare IoT are numerous, including security\nof records,\
    \ secure management of data, privacy preservation of sensitive data, reliable\n\
    remote monitoring of patients, non-repudiation, immutability and decentralization,\
    \ as\npointed out by [52]. The authors point out that most blockchain-based healthcare\
    \ solu-\ntions use Ethereum platform. It is also shown that the healthcare systems\
    \ mostly utilize\nprivate blockchain.\nA blockchain-based framework is proposed\
    \ in [99] that allows continuous patient\nmonitoring using IoT. This scheme provides\
    \ role-based access control and improves security\nand authentication in patient’s\
    \ smart devices.\nTo resolve issues regarding data sharing, scalability and quality\
    \ of service, a blockchain-\nbased solution is proposed in [100]. The proposed\
    \ scheme is called ssHealth (smart and\nsecure Healthcare system). This scheme\
    \ allows remote monitoring of students while\naddressing the issues mentioned\
    \ above.\nIn order to resolve security and privacy related challenges, a blockchain-based\
    \ scheme\nis proposed in [101], which utilizes consortium blockchain in addition\
    \ to a new consensus\nalgorithm called MBFT (Mixed Byzantine Fault Tolerance).\
    \ The proposed scheme provides\nprivacy, fault tolerance and and better transaction\
    \ handling. In [102], a scheme is proposed\nto eliminate single-point-of-failure,\
    \ man-in-the-middle and data snifﬁng attacks using\npublic blockchain. This scheme\
    \ preserves data privacy, provides immutability and efﬁcient\nidentity management.\n\
    3.2.3. Supply Chain\nBlockchain is used by suppliers to record the supplies purchased\
    \ or to be purchased.\nAn advantage provided by default by blockchain beneﬁts\
    \ supply chain greatly, which is\nnon-repudiation. Due to non-repudiation, a buyer\
    \ cannot deny purchasing materials from\na seller.\nIn [103], a multi-ledger tracking\
    \ framework is proposed that simpliﬁes supply chain\nmanagement. The proposed\
    \ framework consists of two layers; layer 1 uses multiple private\nsub-ledgers\
    \ and layer 2 utilizes a public ledger. A single shipment is represented by the\n\
    sub-ledgers. Public ledger is used to track information, which is publicly available.\
    \ The\nframework consists of index server, peers, admin node and external monitoring\
    \ nodes.\nA record of all activities is maintained by the admin node. The index\
    \ server stores the\naddresses of the nodes in the network, peers include nodes,\
    \ admin node is used to keep\nrecord of all networking activities and external\
    \ nodes verify and track the shipment status.\nChen et al. have proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ conceptual framework in [103] to\nimprove supply chain management. The proposed\
    \ framework consists of four layers; IoT\nsensors layer, data layer, contract\
    \ layer and business layer. In this way, the functionalities\nof each service\
    \ are provided. Sensor layer is used to track the goods, data layer consists of\n\
    blockchain and smart contracts, the contract layer ensures data quality and contract\
    \ layer\nexecutes the processes related to business management.\nElectronics 2021,\
    \ 10, 1732\n12 of 26\n3.2.4. Electronic Voting\nElection fraud is prevented using\
    \ blockchain. Blockchain in voting works in the way\nthat a block is added to\
    \ the blockchain upon a successful vote. As blockchain brings\nimmutability and\
    \ integrity, it ensures that the records cannot be changed. Voting also\nbeneﬁts\
    \ from transparency that blockchain brings, as the records are kept transparent\
    \ in\nthe network. In this subsection, we brieﬂy discuss the strengths of blockchain-based\
    \ voting\nschemes proposed in recent literature. Blockchain-based electronic voting\
    \ is discussed in\ndetail in [53]. This survey reviews the literature and discusses\
    \ its strengths and limitations.\nThe authors point out that transparency and\
    \ decentralization are most useful features of\nblockchain to be used by electronic\
    \ voting systems, whereas limitations include scalability\nissues and coercion\
    \ resistance.\nIn [104], a blockchain-based transparent ballot box protocol has\
    \ been proposed that\nfollows e-voting properties and provides decentralization.\
    \ The proposed scheme allows\nthe elector to modify the vote in allowed voting\
    \ phase. A protocol has been proposed\nin [105] called VYV (Verify Your Vote)\
    \ based on blockchain. This protocol provides fairness,\nvote privacy and veriﬁability.\
    \ In [106], a scheme is proposed to eliminate the need of\na third party and decentralize\
    \ the voting network using blockchain. The strengths of\nthis scheme include public\
    \ veriﬁability, consistency, auditability, transparency and user\nanonymity. A\
    \ blockchain-based protocol is proposed in [107] that utilizes homomorphic\nElGamal\
    \ encryption. The authors claim that their scheme guarantees privacy preservation\n\
    and anonymity.\n3.2.5. Smart Cities\nBlockchain smart contracts can be integrated\
    \ with properties like cars, houses, patents,\netc. Decentralization, immutability,\
    \ pseudonymity and transparency are useful features of\nblockchain for smart cities.\
    \ In [51], authors review recent literature on blockchain-based\nenergy consumption\
    \ systems. Authors conclude that energy consumption in smart cities\ncan be made\
    \ efﬁcient using blockchain, because blockchain provides decentralization,\nanonymity,\
    \ transparency, and tamper-prooﬁng.\nIn [108], blockchain is used to propose personal\
    \ archive storage scheme to provide\nauthenticity, accuracy and transparency.\
    \ The different actors in the proposed scheme\ninclude subject, certiﬁer, client\
    \ and stake node. Subject owns digital artifacts, certiﬁer issues\na certiﬁcate\
    \ to the subject, client is someone who requests to access personal digital artifacts\n\
    and stake node maintains blockchain ledger. This scheme provides secure storage\
    \ and\nefﬁcient authentication.\nIn [109], a blockchain-based framework called\
    \ BC-PDS (Blockchain-based Personal\nData Store) has been proposed for personal\
    \ data storage. This scheme utilizes existing\nOpenPDS/SafeAnswers framework.\
    \ For anonymization, this scheme uses AutoNomy-\nbased Access Control (ANAC).\n\
    3.3. Smart Contracts\nIn public blockchain, all participating nodes have the privilege\
    \ to deploy smart con-\ntracts without needing any prerequisites. In Ethereum,\
    \ solidity language is used for\ncreating contracts while Metamask is used for\
    \ ID creation and Remix IDE is used for its\nonline demonstration and results\
    \ of applications.\nComputer programs and codes that can work anonymously are\
    \ known as smart\ncontracts. They provide an agreement or a consensus between\
    \ the two parties involved.\nUsers cannot alter or delete a smart contract once\
    \ it is published on the blockchain network.\nNo central authority involvement\
    \ is needed for validation of tasks. The results computed by\nthe nodes in the\
    \ network do not have any interference from outside the network. Banking,\nsupply\
    \ chain, IoT and insurance industries are deploying permissioned smart contracts.\n\
    In [110], Rathee et al. proposed a framework for connected and autonomous vehicles\n\
    (CAV), in which smart contracts with blockchain are implemented for security assurance\
    \ of\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n13 of 26\nvehicles. Veriﬁcation of registration\
    \ providers and tracking or alteration of user data can be\nhandled through it.\n\
    Through smart contracts, mobility services and smart transportation are implemented\n\
    and deﬁned by IPFS in [111], in which DLTs (Distributed Ledger Technologies)-based\n\
    infrastructure with distributed data management technologies have been used for\
    \ data\nsharing and providing smart services. In [112], Ethereum smart contract\
    \ and IOTA-based\narchitecture for authenticity has been proposed by Zichichi\
    \ et al., in which the entities’ co-\nordination, access authorization, and privacy\
    \ of users have been achieved. Zero knowledge\nproof for privacy offering and\
    \ the guarantee for proof of location has been used.\nA system CHORUS mobility\
    \ in [113], whereas, in [114], a decentralized system has\nbeen presented for\
    \ smart transportation system with the combination of VANETs and\nEthereum for\
    \ rules enforcement.\n3.4. Consensus\nAn important part and key contribution of\
    \ blockchain is its consensus mechanisms.\nConsensus mechanisms are used to make\
    \ agreement between different parties in a dis-\ntributed environment to append\
    \ blocks in the blockchain. There are two main types of\nconsensus mechanisms;\
    \ proof-based consensus and voting-based consensus. Proof-based\nconsensus involves\
    \ adding blocks by the qualiﬁed individuals and voting-based mecha-\nnism involves\
    \ sharing the results of transaction in order to make the ﬁnal decision. A very\n\
    important and basic part of bitcoin is POW (Proof of Work) [4], which involves\
    \ intensive\nmathematical computations. In terms of resource and energy consumption,\
    \ POW is very\nexpensive. Given the heaviness and cost of the task, PoW still\
    \ seems the best solution\nbecause it prevents spamming and DoS attacks.\nPOW\
    \ is hard to be performed but it is easy to be veriﬁed once performed. In case\
    \ of\nbitcoin, this task is performed by the miners and veriﬁable by everyone\
    \ in the network who\nis a part of blockchain peer-to-peer network. Miners are\
    \ given incentives because the task\nthey perform successfully is fundamentally\
    \ very expensive. A new block in blockchain can\nonly be added after solving an\
    \ expensive mathematical task.\n3.4.1. Proof-Based Consensus\nThere are following\
    \ proof-based consensus algorithms.\n•\nProof of Work (POW) Consensus: First use\
    \ of PoW consensus started with Bitcoin\nand became popular after it. It was originally\
    \ used to verify the transactions and for\nmining purpose. When a miner mines\
    \ a transaction, he has to solve a mathematical\npuzzle. The puzzle involves looking\
    \ for a value that when hashed generates a speciﬁc\nvalue. This puzzle is fundamentally\
    \ computationally expensive. A new block cannot\nbe added to the blockchain without\
    \ successfully mining it. Once a miner ﬁnds a\nsolution to the puzzle, it is broadcasted\
    \ in the network and can be veriﬁed by any\nor all of the peers. Validation is\
    \ a cheap task in terms of computational resources it\nconsumes, as it only involves\
    \ hashing a value, and hence can be done by anyone in\nthe network. As it takes\
    \ lots of computing resources to solve this puzzle, the miners\nare given an intentive.\
    \ After Bitcoin, PoW has been implemented in other several\ncryptocurrencies,\
    \ namely Litecoin, Dash and Monero.\n•\nProof of Stake (PoS) Consensus: In PoW,\
    \ multiple miners are attempting to solve the\nmathematical puzzle at the same\
    \ time. The ﬁrst successful miner is given an incentive\nfor adding a block in\
    \ the blockchain, but for other miners, this process was a waste\nof computing\
    \ resources. This limitation of PoW is covered by PoS. In PoS, miners\nare in\
    \ no competition with each other. The validator receives a transaction fee for\n\
    addition of a new block. In this way, the total amount of currency always remains\n\
    the same in the network. Also, the validator is elected beforehand in PoS, unlike\n\
    PoW, where anyone with enough computational resources in the nwtwork can mine.\n\
    No one except this elected validator can add a new block. Anyone who wants to\n\
    be elected has to put a part of his currency at stake. The amount of currency\
    \ put\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n14 of 26\nat stack is directly proportional\
    \ to the chances of being elected as a validator. After\nthe successful validation,\
    \ the validator receives the staked currency as well as the\ntransaction fees,\
    \ and the other candidates get their staked amount back. PoS is used\nby Nxt.\n\
    •\nHybrid PoW and PoS: A comparison between PoS and PoW is given in Table 5. It\n\
    shows properties of both the consensus mechanisms and hybrid consensus mechanism.\n\
    However, some schemes use a hybrid of both PoS and PoW consensus mechanisms.\n\
    The key advantage of using this hybrid is getting the advantages from both of\
    \ these\nschemes and using one scheme to overcome the limitation of the other\
    \ one. A hybrid\nconsensus mechanism has been used by Decred cryptocurrency.\n\

    \ include the following.\n•\nProof of Capacity (PoC) Consensus: Started with Burstcoin,\
    \ the PoC mechanism\ndecreases the usage of computational resources and uses storage\
    \ resources. Before\nmining is started, miners store the set of possible solutions\
    \ of the puzzle. The miner\nwho has more storage tends to store more solutions.\
    \ Thus, the miners with more\nstorage space have higher chances of mining.\n•\n\
    Proof of Burn (PoB) Consensus: A concept named “eater address” is used in PoB.\n\
    Before starting mining, the miners send coins to an invalid address randomly.\
    \ Blocks\nare created and these addresses are changes. The coins sent to these\
    \ addresses are not\nusable anymore because of the fact that these addresses are\
    \ invalid and unknown. The\nprocess is repeated until there is only one miner\
    \ left that has some more coins to invest.\nThis miner receives the mining coins\
    \ and the transaction fees as a reward. Miners that\nhave been investing in creation\
    \ of blocks in the past are given more privileges. PoB is\nused by Slimcoin.\n\
    •\nProof of Importance (PoI) Consensus: PoI is a score-based protocol that was\
    \ ﬁrst used\nwith NEM cryptocurrency. The individual who invests more coins in\
    \ the network\nmakes the higher score. This score is affected by the number of\
    \ transactions and the\nsize of transactions. The lower limit for investing coins\
    \ in 10,000 coins. The user with\nhighest score has the highest chance of being\
    \ a validator.\n4. Integration of Blockchain and IoT\nMany researches integrate\
    \ blockchain in IoT to enhance security and provide an\nefﬁcient data storage\
    \ system. In [56], authors review the recent literature on blockchain’s\nintegration\
    \ with IoT. It is pointed out that blockchain helps to improve security and\n\
    scalability in IoT scenarios. In [62], authors highlight some attacks that IoT\
    \ systems are\nprone to, and review the researches that use blockchain to mitigate\
    \ privacy-related issues\nin IoT.\nThis section explains why blockchain is useful\
    \ in an IoT environment.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n15 of 26\n4.1. Opportunities\
    \ Brought by Blockchain in IoT\nBlockchain brings many opportunities in IoT. Integration\
    \ of blockchain in IoT has\nbeen increasing in IoT since Bitcoin.\n4.1.1. Secure\
    \ Storage\nIoT devices collect data and transmit it across other devices. These\
    \ devices are con-\nnected to each other through Internet, and a lot of IoT devices\
    \ use cloud computing in order\nto keep the data synchronized. This data, if compromised,\
    \ can result in loss of security and\nprivacy of a user. Blockchain can be used\
    \ to securely use and transmit this data across the\nnetwork. Also, blockchain\
    \ makes the records immutable, so no records can be modiﬁed by\na malicious user,\
    \ speciﬁcally healthcare records that need to be kept secure.\n4.1.2. Decentralization\n\
    As IoT devices are distributed, blockchain provides an efﬁcient and convenient\
    \ solu-\ntion for decentralization. Data can be maintained in the blockchain and\
    \ published without\nthe fear of potential modiﬁcations to be made by a malicious\
    \ third party. As seen in bitcoin,\nblockchain provides decentralization solution\
    \ in P2P networks [4]. The data are distributed\nusing blockchain among other\
    \ IoT devices in a decentralized fashion. In this way, the use\nof blockchain\
    \ also eradicates the need of a central entity, such as a cloud server. Another\
    \ ad-\nvantage that comes from this property of blockchain is removal of a single-point-of-failure,\n\
    because when a central entity is involved, it becomes a target of malicious users.\n\
    4.1.3. Encryption\nBlockchain stores hashes of the data in the ledger, which makes\
    \ it light-weighted, as\nhash functions generate a small and ﬁxed size of output\
    \ for any size of input. The actual\ndata are usually stored on a cloud server\
    \ and hashes are kept in the blockchain. Blockchain\nusually utilizes SHA-256\
    \ algorithm for hashing. Symmetric encryption in blockchain\nprovides user and\
    \ transaction security, prevents double-spending problem and veriﬁcation\nof digital\
    \ asset transfer. Because of secure encryption mechanisms that blockchain provides,\n\
    authors of [58] point out that it can be used to guarantee privacy preservation\
    \ in IoT and\nIIoT. It is concluded that blockchain can help to pave better and\
    \ more efﬁcient ways for\nbusinesses in IoT industry, such as mobile commerce,\
    \ food logistics management, electric\nvehicles, etc.\n4.1.4. Access Control\n\
    Traditional access control systems are shifting toward blockchain in IoT-based\
    \ en-\nvironments. Blockchain provides attribute-based and ﬁne-grained encryption,\
    \ granular\nattribute-based, and role-based access control solutions [36] for\
    \ IoT.\nZhao et al. [115] proposed a message encryption scheme using symmetric\
    \ key en-\ncryption. In this scheme, the data owner uses attribute-based encryption\
    \ to encrypt a\nmessage with default attributes and sends the ciphertext to the\
    \ encryption proxy server.\nXu et al. [116] utilize smart contracts with capability-based\
    \ solutions that achieve high\nscalability and interoperability while focusing\
    \ on delegation. However, authorization\nmodel is not provided in the paper.\n\
    A blockchain-based architecture for IoT privacy preservation is proposed by Rahula-\n\
    mathavan et al. [117], in which an attribute-based encryption has been used with\
    \ Testbed\nplatform to achieve data privacy and conﬁdentiality, but there is a\
    \ slight time increase due\nto involvement of multiple attribute authorities and\
    \ using PoW consensus mechanism.\n4.2. Applications of Blockchain in IoT\nThis\
    \ section describes the uses of blockchain in different IoT scenarios.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1732\n16 of 26\n4.2.1. Healthcare System\nDifferent sensors have been\
    \ introduced to detect and upload patient’s information\non cloud in emergency\
    \ situations from a remote location. These sensors/devices can\nautomatically\
    \ communicate with the medical personnel upon detecting a certain threshold.\n\
    Using IoT, patients can be checked up from remote locations through these sensors\
    \ and it is\noften possible. In addition to checkup, it is also used to treat\
    \ the patients. This can, in many\ncases, help save a life and provide medical\
    \ help to patients in emergency situations in\ntime. Blockchain comes with many\
    \ beneﬁts that could be helpful for IoT when it comes to\nhealthcare systems.\
    \ It can protect the privacy and security of critical data stored in eHealth\n\
    systems. When needed, it can also allow to use the data without modifying it.\n\
    4.2.2. Software Deﬁned Network\nSoftware deﬁned networking technology has been\
    \ proposed for increasing bandwidth\nof IoT devices. The processing of decision\
    \ making is simpliﬁed and intelligent routing\nis provided. An example is DiskBlockNet;\
    \ an IoT network architecture with distributed\nnetwork that provides ﬂexibility\
    \ and scalability without central controlling server. In this\ndistributed network\
    \ of blockchain, two kinds of nodes are present, veriﬁcation node for\nmaintaining\
    \ the information ﬂow of tables and responding node to update table ﬂow rules.\n\
    4.2.3. Crowdsensing Applications\nCrowdsensing is a novel kind of mobile IoT,\
    \ like geo sensing. On blockchain cryp-\ntocurrencies, privacy preservation incentive\
    \ mechanism was developed by Wang et al. [70].\nWhich eliminates privacy and security\
    \ issues like impersonation attacks, with the help of\ntransparent blockchain\
    \ and data veriﬁcation by the miners.\n4.2.4. Energy Systems\nFuture of energy\
    \ systems is known as smart grids which are the replacement of\ntraditional energy\
    \ systems due to the involvement of ICT (Information and Communication\nTechnology).\
    \ Because of various advantages like cost effectiveness, uninterrupted power\n\
    supply and two-way communication, smart grid is considered as the next generation\
    \ of\nenergy systems [118].\n4.2.5. Internet of Vehicles\nEstablishment of smart\
    \ communication between heterogeneous networks and vehicles\n(V) like V to Road,\
    \ V to V, V to Infrastructure, V to Sensor, V to Everything and V to Human\nare\
    \ some emerging technologies in IoT. Many authors proposed various decentralized\n\
    security models like LNSC, for managing charging pile and electric vehicle [119]\
    \ by using\nECC and hash functions.\n4.3. Blockchain-Based IoT Privacy Preserving\
    \ Schemes\nAs IoT consists of billions of devices accross the world, it poses\
    \ serious threats to the\nprivacy of the users. Other than providing decentralization,\
    \ consensus and smart contracts\nfor IoT, blockchain is being used at a large\
    \ scale to assure privacy preservation in IoT.\nTable 6 presents a summary of\
    \ recent researches based on the scheme utilizing blockchain\nfor privacy preservation\
    \ in IoT.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n17 of 26\nTable 6. Recent research on blockchain-based\

    Recently, many schemes have been proposed for blockchain-based privacy preserva-\n\
    tion in IoT. For electric vehicles, a blockchain-based privacy preserving charging\
    \ system has\nbeen proposed in [125]. In this scheme, for every session, a new\
    \ pair of keys are generated\nby the system. Other than that, for providing anonymity\
    \ protection in blockchain, the\ntechniques like ring signatures, non-interactive\
    \ zero knowledge and mixing services are\nfrequently used.\nSome limitations of\
    \ anonymization include high computation cost, de-anonymization\nand loss of meaningful\
    \ information through generalization and suppression.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n\
    18 of 26\n4.3.2. Ring Signatures\nTo improv privacy in blockchain signiﬁcantly,\
    \ a set of choices need to be made without\nthe need of a central manager. For\
    \ generation of anonymous signatures from possible\nsigners group, without identity\
    \ disclosure, a scheme is proposed by fujisaki et al. in [126].\nLinkability and\
    \ anonymity are properties that are achieved through ring signatures-based\nprivacy\
    \ preserving mechanisms [127–129].\nIn [127], Saberhagen et al. proposed CrptoNote.\
    \ In this scheme, with single private\nkey, the user can sign one valid transaction.\
    \ It is a modiﬁcation of ring signatures, which\nmitigates the attacks like double\
    \ spending by replacing tags with image of key comput-\ning. The signer identity\
    \ can only be disclosed when he uses the same pair of keys for\nsecond signature.\n\
    RingCT is an improvement of CryptoNote, which provides transactional privacy\n\
    as well as identity privacy by Noether et al [128]. Ring signatures with Greg\
    \ Maxwell’s\nConﬁdential Transaction [130]a are used for hiding the amount whereas\
    \ the amount is\nplaced at MLSAG (Multilayer Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group\
    \ Signature) [131].\nMonero is a strong implementation of this approach [129].\
    \ In [132], heavily centralized\nintermediaries were used but they are also vulnerable\
    \ to security attacks. In Creditcoin [57],\nanonymized ring signatures announcements\
    \ have been proposed in which user’s privacy\ncan achieved. In this work, an incentive-based\
    \ network has also been created.\nLimitation of ring signatures include the following:\n\
    •\nLarge size of transactions increases the storage space of blockchain records.\n\
    •\nSize of ring signature is directly proportional to the number of participants,\
    \ that is\nwhy only limited number of outputs are generated.\n•\nAuditing difﬁculty\
    \ is also faced due to hidden amount.\n4.3.3. Non Interactive Zero Knowledge\n\
    It is an alternative approach of zero knowledge proof. Message veriﬁcation can\
    \ be\ndone in an anonymous way because of not having an interaction between veriﬁer\
    \ and\nprover. A scheme was proposed by Blum et al. [133], in which, the correctness\
    \ of assertion\ncan be proven without leaking any information.\nZeroCash [134]\
    \ and ZeroCoin [135] are two blockchain-based anonymization schemes\nin which\
    \ ZKP concept has been used for the prevention of transactional data leakage.\n\
    At high computational cost, Zerocash achieves the highest level of anonymization.\
    \ In\ncontrast, Hawk [136] is the ﬁrst work to provide programmability and transactional\
    \ privacy\nin blockchain.\nLimitations of non interactive zero knowledge include\
    \ high computational cost of trans-\nactions proof, fixed coin dominations in\
    \ zerocoin and unprotected public transaction lists.\n4.3.4. Mixing\nFor mitigation\
    \ of analytical attack, which is used for accessing the sender or receiver\ntransaction’s\
    \ privacy information, in a blockchain system, mixing approach has been used,\n\
    which is also known as laundry or tumbler. Chaum [137] presented the service,\
    \ in which\ncommunication content as well as sender and receiver information can\
    \ be hidden.\nCurrently, to reduce de-anonymization risk and obfuscation of transaction\
    \ history, the\nresearchers are focusing on centralized and decentralized mixing\
    \ strategies. Many mixing\nwebsites like onion bc, bitcoin fog, bitmixer, helix\
    \ by grams, bit laundry, send shared and\nbitblender are available. By providing\
    \ some fees they can provide anonymous mixing\ntransaction service. Some services\
    \ are only provided through TOR network, on which, free\nworldwide anonymous communication\
    \ has been enabled.\nBy not transferring data to the receiver, the attacker steals\
    \ the user asset [138]. Disclo-\nsure of personnel data is not ensured by the\
    \ system because, in transactions, routing the\nservice provider keeps the user\
    \ log. Conditional execution is the ﬁrst solution, in which the\nmixer only gets\
    \ reward when it correctly operates, otherwise it does not get any rewards\nfrom\
    \ the user. CoinSwap is a bitcoin mixing protocol introduced by Gregory et al.\
    \ [130],\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n19 of 26\nin which transactions are done\
    \ in escrow mechanism structure with hash lock protec-\ntion. An accountable mechanism\
    \ based on signatures, Mixcoin has been proposed by\nBonneau et al. [139] that\
    \ exposes the misbehaving mixer by unambiguous proof made by\nthe users.\nAnother\
    \ solution is Blind signature scheme, in which a message is blinded by the\nsystem\
    \ before the signing of the message. Blinding, signing and unblinding are three\n\
    steps. It is publicly veriﬁable, whereas the origin and connection is hidden from\
    \ the signer.\nBlindcoin [140] is a combination of append-only public log with\
    \ blind signature scheme\nfor accountability of mixing process. For mixing fairness\
    \ and providing anonymity, smart\ncontracts with blind signatures are applied\
    \ by Hielman et al. in [141].\nDash [142] made the ﬁrst anonymity attempt in digital\
    \ currency environment which\nwas released in 2014. Removal of a user’s unique\
    \ information on blockchain is done in\nthis project, called PrivateSend. To avoid\
    \ coin theft and achieve complete unlinkability,\nTumbleBit [143] was proposed.\
    \ A strategy for ﬁnancial transactions decentralization,\nCoinShufﬂe by Rufﬁng\
    \ et al. [144] was introduced. Through decentralized blockchain\nbehavior mixing\
    \ with third party, removal has been ensured.\nMixing Limitations include the\
    \ following:\n•\nFor fair exchange of transactions, the executional process or\
    \ online participants waiting\ncreates a huge delay.\n•\nA single point of failure\
    \ exists due to centralized nature of the server. This makes the\nserver vulnerable\
    \ to DoS attacks.\n•\nHigh mixing fees are a problem for users in fair exchange\
    \ of transactions. Due to\nlow anonymity level, mixing protocol can easily be\
    \ compromised through Sybil\nattacks [145].\n•\nThe leakage of transaction privacy\
    \ through backtracking analysis of transactional\ngraph is a serious issue.\n\
    4.3.5. Differential Privacy\nTo achieve the data conﬁdentiality without leakage\
    \ risks through privacy preserva-\ntion, a technique has been proposed known as\
    \ differential privacy by C Dwork, who\nmade a database protection mechanism which\
    \ adds noise at each query evaluation [146].\nFor protection of health care systems,\
    \ data perturbation mechanism has been used by\nDagher et al. in [147]. In [148],\
    \ a scheme is presented to protect a smart home resident’s\nprivacy through multiple\
    \ pseudonym techniques. Trafﬁc encryption has been done for\nproviding data authenticity,\
    \ access control and conﬁdentiality.\nDifferential privacy limitations include:\n\
    •\nDifferential privacy provides privacy-utility trade-off. Precision in Data\
    \ and loss\nof certainty are the results of increasing noise addition for enhancing\
    \ the privacy\nlevel [149].\n•\nIt is prone to timing analysis attack in trafﬁc\
    \ ﬂow obfuscation mechanisms [150].\n5. Conclusions\nDespite of all the opportunities\
    \ that IoT brings, it suffers from issues like hetero-\ngeneity of IoT devices,\
    \ resource constraints, and poor interoperability between these\ndevices. Other\
    \ important challenges in IoT include privacy, availability, conﬁdentiality\n\
    and integrity. Blockchain comes with opportunities like immutability, decentralization,\n\
    transparency, integrity, consensus, conﬁdentiality, non-repudiation, privacy and\
    \ security in\na distributed network. When blockchain is implemented in IoT, it\
    \ provides solutions to the\nproblems faced.\nThe aim of this paper has been to\
    \ provide a comprehensive survey of the problems\nfaced by IoT and the solutions\
    \ provided by the blockchain technology. We ﬁrst discussed\nblockchain and IoT\
    \ separately. We looked at the applications, advantages and limitations\nof both\
    \ of these technologies. We then analyzed the impact that blockchain has on IoT.\
    \ We\ndiscussed how IoT is beneﬁted by blockchain, based on the opportunities\
    \ and strengths of\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n20 of 26\nblockchain. We reviewed\
    \ researches based on the implementation of blockchain in IoT in\nresource constrained\
    \ environments. It is highlighted that the use of blockchain is increasing\nin\
    \ IoT and providing the solutions that it needs, from healthcare to smart homes\
    \ to military.\nIoT uses a large number of devices and most of these devices are\
    \ resource-constrained.\nBlockchain being light-weighted is a great solution for\
    \ privacy preservation in resource-\nconstrained devices. The privacy aspect of\
    \ blockchain comes from its ability to provide\ntransparency in a distributed\
    \ network. We have seen that the use of blockchain, other than\nproviding immutability,\
    \ decentralization, and consensus, it helps preserving user’s privacy\nin IoT\
    \ environment.\n6. Future Research Directions and Challenges\nPrivacy preservation\
    \ is important because users’ data is collected by almost all IoT\ndevices. We\
    \ present some future research directions in terms of privacy preservation.\n\
    6.1. IOTA Ledger\nIn order to provide security and privacy, integration of the\
    \ Tangle in IoT can be very\nuseful. Tangle is a data structure that IOTA is based\
    \ on. It utilizes a directed acyclic graph\nand utilizes less energy as compared\
    \ to a blockchain network. IOTA is light-weighted and\nquantum resistant. Another\
    \ important advantage is that IOTA does not need miners. The\nnetwork participants\
    \ issue new transactions without having to involve another node that\nhas better\
    \ computing resources. Having no miners makes IOTA fee-less.\n6.2. Strong Privacy\
    \ Preservation Mechanisms\nStrong privacy preservation is still a challenge when\
    \ using blockchain. For example,\nin order to resist Sybil attack, a certain amount\
    \ of honest participants are required in\ndecentralized mixing protocol. Hawk\
    \ reinitializes and creates a different trusted process\nfor every smart contract,\
    \ so privacy preservation having few trust assumptions needs to\nbe enhanced.\n\
    6.3. Security Framework\nA single security solution for all blockchain-based IoT\
    \ devices cannot fulﬁll security\nrequirement due to resources-constrained nature\
    \ of devices. The designs of such kinds of\nframeworks are required to provide\
    \ dynamic and adaptable security. Implementation of\nother privacy preserving\
    \ solutions, such as data anonymization and differential privacy\nalong with blockchain,\
    \ can provide better privacy. A framework is needed that can preserve\nprivacy\
    \ using both the techniques, keeping resource-constrained nature of IoT devices\n\
    in mind.\n6.4. Blockchain-Based Infrastructure\nThe storage in decentralized large-sized\
    \ blockchain is also an issue, as we have seen\nthat IoT devices are storing data\
    \ continuously whether it is useful or not which increases\nthe blockchain data\
    \ and makes it heavy. Since all nodes in the blockchain network are\nrequired\
    \ to keep a local copy of the ledger, it becomes infeasible for light-weighted\
    \ devices\nto store a copy of the ledger. A framework is required that reduces\
    \ the storage overhead on\nsmall IoT devices caused by blockchain maintenance.\n\

    \ Nature 2022\nAbstract\nNowadays, blockchain technology and industry has developed\
    \ rapidly all over the world, which is inseparable from\ncontinuous innovation\
    \ and improvement on smart contract technology. Therefore, by summarizing the\
    \ working principle\nand application research status of blockchain smart contract,\
    \ this paper analyzes the development and challenges of smart\ncontract. Firstly,\
    \ we introduce the model and operation principle of blockchain smart contract\
    \ for the overall architecture,\nanalyze the deployment process of smart contract\
    \ with Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and EOSIO, and make a comparative\nanalysis\
    \ from the technical level. And taking Byteball, InterValue and IOTA platforms\
    \ as examples, we introduce the\ndeployment process and application potential\
    \ for DAG-based blockchain smart contract. Additionally, we also summarize\nthe\
    \ application research of smart contract for international and Blockchain Oracle,\
    \ and discuss its innovative application\nand development trend in the future.\
    \ Secondly, we introduce the application status of smart contract with Ethereum\
    \ and\nHyperledger Fabric platforms from the aspects of ﬁnancial transactions,\
    \ Internet of things, medical applications, and supply\nchain, and further discuss\
    \ EOS (enterprise operation system), Blockchain Oracle and other application ﬁelds.\

    With the rapid development of cryptocurrencies such as\nBitcoin and the application\
    \ of blockchain technology in\nindustries such as ﬁnance, Internet of things (IoT),\
    \ cloud\ncomputing and supply-chain, blockchain has gradually\nattracted global\
    \ attention [1]. Blockchain provides a pro-\ngrammable environment for smart contracts\
    \ as an emerging\ntechnology with great potential. Taking advantage of\nblockchain,\
    \ smart contract has been widely used in\nblockchain. Smart contract can not only\
    \ change the exist-\ning business model, but also bring a lot of convenience to\n\
    public life in reality.\nThe concept of ‘‘smart contract’’ was ﬁrst proposed by\n\
    Nick Szabo in 1995 [2], speciﬁcally deﬁned as ‘‘a smart\ncontract is a set of\
    \ commitments deﬁned in digital form,\nincluding the agreement that the participants\
    \ in contract\ncan implement these commitments’’. Smart contract is a\ncomputer\
    \ protocol designed to disseminate, verify or exe-\ncute contracts in an information-based\
    \ manner. It allows\ntrusted transactions without a third party and these trans-\n\
    actions are traceable and irreversible, which purpose is to\nprovide better security\
    \ than traditional contracts and reduce\nother transaction costs related to contracts.\
    \ Therefore,\nsmart contract characterized by the high efﬁciency of\ndevelopment,\
    \ lower maintenance cost and high accuracy of\nexecution ﬁt perfectly with the\
    \ blockchain technology. It\n& Lei Zhang\n8213662@163.com\n& Li-li Ji\njmsdxwk3019@163.com\n\

    can be said that smart contract is one of the key features of\nblockchain technology\
    \ [3]. As a core technology of\nblockchain, smart contract based on blockchain\
    \ has been\nwidely used in blockchain projects with strong inﬂuence\nsuch as Ethereum\
    \ and Hyperledger.\nThe emergence of blockchain technology deﬁned smart\ncontract\
    \ and made it possible. Smart contract is an\nembedded programming contract that\
    \ can be built into any\nblockchain data, transaction or asset to form systems,\n\
    which to form systems, markets or assets controlled by the\nprogram [4]. It not\
    \ only provides innovative solutions for\nthe ﬁnancial industry, but also plays\
    \ an important role in\nthe management of affairs as information, assets, contracts,\n\
    supervision, and others in the social system.\nAccording to the progressive history\
    \ of blockchain\ntechnology, the development of smart contract can be\ndivided\
    \ into three stages, as shown in Fig. 1: in blockchain\n1.0, the representative\
    \ application is Bitcoin, which the\ncontract for it is mainly used to achieve\
    \ digital currency\ntransaction, and its function is relatively single. And RSK\n\
    (rootstock), the smart contract development platform based\non bitcoin ecosystem,\
    \ also needs to be highly compatible\nwith Ethereum at present [5]. In blockchain\
    \ 2.0, with the\nemergence of smart contract, DApp (decentration appli-\ncation)\
    \ can be built on the blockchain, which the transac-\ntion speed and the system\
    \ performance are improved, and\nthe functions are diversiﬁed. According to the\
    \ openness of\nblockchain, it can be generally divided into public block-\nchain\
    \ and consortium (both private blockchain and con-\nsortium blockchain belong\
    \ to the license blockchain, and\nprivate blockchain is a special form of consortium\n\
    blockchain) [6]. Among them, the most representative\ndevelopment platforms are\
    \ Ethereum and Hyperledger\nFabric respectively. With the prosperity and development\n\
    of blockchain ecology, new development platforms con-\ntinue to make breakthroughs\
    \ (such as side chain / cross\nchain technology, etc.) [7–9] to solve the current\
    \ chal-\nlenging problems and make full preparations for the arrival\nof blockchain\
    \ 3.0. At the same time, they are also highly\nexpected and disputed, and the\
    \ most representative devel-\nopment platform is EOS. To sum up, Ethereum, Hyper-\n\
    ledger Fabric and EOS are representative in terms of\ntechnology. Ethereum and\
    \ Hyperledger Fabric are two core\nplatforms for developing smart contracts at\
    \ present, and\nanalyzing their system architecture will help us understand\n\
    the development principle of smart contract for the public\nblockchain and the\
    \ consortium chain. The review of EOS\nwill help us better understand the development\
    \ trend of\nsmart contract and trigger readers’ thinking on the large-\nscale\
    \ application of smart contract. In addition, these three\nplatforms are also\
    \ in a state of continuous development,\nfrom which we can understand how the\
    \ blockchain tech-\nnology led by smart contract can help the real economy to\n\
    develop to a deeper level in a new way of cooperation.\nIn view of the decentralized\
    \ nature of blockchain-based\nsmart contracts and the nature of the contracts\
    \ themselves,\nthe applications of blockchain-based smart contracts can be\ndivided\
    \ into three categories from the technical level:\n1.\nEthereum. This is an open-source\
    \ and universal public\nblockchain platform with smart contract function,\nwhich\
    \ the point-to-point contract is processed through\nits special cryptocurrency\
    \ Ether (ETH) and Ethereum\nUnder Development\nBlockchain\n1.0 era\nBlockchain\n\

    \ (EVM) [10]. It can be used to create\ndecentralized programs, autonomous organizations,\n\
    and smart contracts, which its applications of goal\ncover ﬁelds such as ﬁnance,\
    \ IoT, smart grid and sports\nquiz.\n2.\nHyperledger Fabric. This is a modular\
    \ and open-source\nenterprise class licensed distributed ledger technology\n(DLT)\
    \ platform, which is designed to be used in the\nenterprise environment. It mainly\
    \ provides functions\nsuch as channels creation and pluggable implementa-\ntion\
    \ of different components [11]. Fabric has a highly\nmodular and conﬁgurable architecture,\
    \ which can\nprovide innovation, ﬂexibility and optimization for\nbanking,\nﬁnance,\n\
    insurance,\nhealthcare,\nhuman\nresources, supply chain and even digital music\
    \ delivery\nindustries.\n3.\nEnterprise Operation System (EOS). This is a block-\n\
    chain underlying public blockchain operating system\ndesigned\nfor\ncommercial\n\
    distributed\napplications,\nwhich aims to solve the problems of low performance,\n\
    poor security, high difﬁculty in development and\nexcessive dependence on handling\
    \ charges of existing\nblockchain applications, and to achieve the perfor-\nmance\
    \ scalability of distributed applications [12]. The\ndecentralized application\
    \ of EOS mainly includes\ne-commerce, ﬁnancial technology, and market.\nSmart\
    \ contract provides a programmable mechanism and\nﬂexible algorithm for bottom\
    \ blockchain data, and lays the\nfoundation for building blockchain 2.0 programmable\n\
    ﬁnancial system and blockchain 3.0 programmable social\nsystem, which will help\
    \ to promote the application of\nblockchain technology in various distributed\
    \ artiﬁcial\nintelligence systems [13]. Smart contract was unable to\nprocess\
    \ the data with complex logic and high throughput in\nthe application, and lacks\
    \ privacy protection as well due to\nthe performance limit of blockchain system.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nof great signiﬁcance to analyze the shortcomings of smart\n\
    contract based on blockchain in the application and study\nthe targeted solutions.\
    \ At present, there have been many\napplications of blockchain smart contract\
    \ with technical\ncontributions to a certain extent. Although smart contract\n\
    had obvious advantages over traditional contract, the in-\ndepth research and\
    \ application of it had still in the stage of\ncontinuous exploration, and the\
    \ potential risks of emerging\ntechnologies still exist.\nThis paper is intended\
    \ to summarize the current research\nresults of application of blockchain smart\
    \ contract on the\ntechnical level. Based on ordering the knowledge of smart\n\
    contract, the paper discusses the deﬁciency of the existing\nresearch results,\
    \ which looks forward with the development\ntrend and prospect of smart contract,\
    \ and hopes to provide\nuseful help and inspiration for the future research on\
    \ key\ntechnologies of it.\n2 Background knowledge of smart contract\napplication\n\
    Nick Szabo’s working theory about smart contract has been\nslow to realize, which\
    \ one of the important reasons is the\nlack of digital systems and technologies\
    \ that can support\nprogrammable contract [3]. The emergence of blockchain\ntechnology\
    \ solves this problem. It can not only support\nprogrammable contracts, but also\
    \ provide with the advan-\ntages of decentralization, tamper-proof, transparent-process\n\
    and traceability, that’s why it is well suited for the devel-\nopment of smart\
    \ contract [14].\nBlockchain technology is based on distributed consen-\nsus algorithm\
    \ to generate and update data, which is several\nmain types of consensus mechanisms\
    \ now [15]: Proof of\nWork (Pow), Proof of Stake (Pos), Practical Byzantine\n\
    Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Delegated Proof of Stake\n(DPOS). Blockchain technology\
    \ mainly ensures the secu-\nrity of data transmission and access through cryptography,\n\
    which is one of the core parts of it. Currently, many clas-\nsical algorithms\
    \ of modern cryptography are used in the\napplication of blockchain [16] including\
    \ the Hash algo-\nrithm, symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, dig-\nital\
    \ signature, etc. Which among them, Secp256k1, an\nElliptic Curve Digital Signature\
    \ Algorithm (ECSDA), is\nthe most commonly used digital signature algorithm.\n\
    According to its functions, the infrastructure of blockchain\n[1] can be divided\
    \ into three parts that form the architecture\nfrom bottom to top: infrastructure,\
    \ protocol and extension,\nas shown in Fig. 2. The infrastructure part links the\
    \ secu-\nrity of traditional network with blockchain security. In the\nprotocol\
    \ part, it realizes the corresponding functions based\non the foundation system\
    \ of hardware or network provided\nby the infrastructure layer. And these two\
    \ parts provided\nthe corresponding functions for the extension part to sup-\n\
    port services. Each part completes the core functions of its\nown, and each layer\
    \ cooperates with each other, thus\nachieving the decentralized trust mechanism.\n\
    The infrastructure part consists of the data layer and the\nnetwork layer. The\
    \ data layer is the lowest level data\nstructure of the whole blockchain technology.\
    \ It encapsu-\nlates the chain structure of the underlying data blocks, as\nwell\
    \ as technologies such as asymmetric public private key\ndata encryption and timestamp.\
    \ Furthermore, its main\nfunctions are data and accounts storage based on Merkle\n\
    tree, as well as the implementation and security of trans-\nactions [17]. The\
    \ essence of blockchain is Peer-to-Peer\n(P2P) network that is nodes maintains\
    \ communication by\nmaintaining a common blockchain. However, the main\nWireless\
    \ Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n637\n123\npurpose of network layer is to achieve\
    \ information inter-\naction between nodes in the blockchain network, which\n\
    includes P2P networking mechanism, data dissemination\nmechanism and data veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism. The protocol\npart is mainly composed of the consensus layer and\
    \ the\nincentive layer. The consensus layer is the basis and core of\nblockchain.\
    \ Highly dispersed nodes can reach a consensus\nin the decentralized system through\
    \ the consensus algo-\nrithm mechanism to jointly maintain the ledger. The\nincentive\
    \ layer mainly includes the issuing mechanism and\ndistribution mechanism of economic\
    \ incentives. Its func-\ntion is to provide incentive measures, which encourages\n\
    nodes to participate in the safety veriﬁcation of blockchain,\nso as to ensure\
    \ the safe operation of the whole network, and\nmostly used in the public blockchain.\
    \ The extension part\nconsists of the contract layer and the application layer,\n\
    which mainly provides diversiﬁed services and access by\ncalling the functional\
    \ components of the protocol part. As\nthe basis of the programmable characteristics\
    \ of block-\nchain, the contract layer encapsules all kinds of scripts,\nalgorithms\
    \ and smart contracts. Moreover, the smart con-\ntract is pieces of code running\
    \ on the blockchain that can\nbe automatically executed without intervention,\
    \ mainly to\nimplement algorithms and custom logic. The application\nlayer encapsules\
    \ various application scenarios and cases of\nblockchain, such as Cryptokitties\
    \ [18] and DApp, and the\nfuture programmable society will also be built on the\n\
    application layer.\nThe basic architecture of smart contract is shown in\nFig.\
    \ 3, and it is composed mainly of data-layer, transport-\nlayer, the main body\
    \ of smart contract, veriﬁcation-layer,\nexecution-layer and application-layer\
    \ [19–21]. The data-\nlayer is mainly responsible for storing the data on the\n\
    blockchain, and interacts with the transport layer through\nthe API, so that transferring\
    \ the relevant data to the main\nbody of smart contract. The transport-layer mainly\
    \ encap-\nsules the protocol that communication and data transmis-\nsion with\
    \ blockchain. The main body of smart contract\nincludes two parts: protocol and\
    \ parameters. Protocol is a\nprocedural description of legal text issued by standard\n\
    organization, and it is a fully instantiated template. As a\nkey part of contract,\
    \ parameters are mainly distributed in\ncontract management, user management,\
    \ data management\nand the business logic. The four parts in parameters\ndirectly\
    \ reﬂect business-logic, and affect the automatic\nexecution of contract, hence\
    \ the main body of smart con-\ntract provides a complex protocol architecture\
    \ for the\ncontract of application based on standardization. The ver-\niﬁcation-layer\
    \ mainly includes veriﬁcation algorithm to\nensure the validity of contract code\
    \ and text. The execu-\ntion-layer encapsules the software related to the running\n\
    environment of smart contract to ensure the normal\nArchitecture\nof \nBlockchain\n\

    The biggest difference between smart contract and tra-\nditional contract is that\

    \ (2022) 28:635–690\n639\n123\ncomputer. Smart contract based on blockchain technology\n\
    has the characteristics of tamper proof and distributed\ntransaction. Tamper proof\
    \ is the most remarkable feature in\nthe blockchain, and its speciﬁc performance\
    \ in that once\nthe smart contract is successfully deployed, then it cannot\n\
    be changed. In addition, each executed contract can be\nsynchronized to each user’s\
    \ data terminal due to the dis-\ntributed feature. Smart contract digitally deploys\
    \ the con-\ntract terms to the blockchain network in the form of code,\nand it\
    \ will be executed automatically once the trigger\nconditions of the protocol\
    \ set are met. The above features\nmake smart contracts ideally applicable to\
    \ the scenarios of\ncontract terms, on account of it can reduce malicious\ntampering\
    \ and human intervention [23].\nSmart contracts have become a landmark product\
    \ in the\nera of digital currency. With smart contract, not only\npeople handle\
    \ decentralized trading and manage digital\nassets, but also the court can use\
    \ its characteristics to deal\nwith various economic disputes. As a kind of computer\n\
    technology, smart contract can not only process informa-\ntion effectively, but\
    \ also ensure that both parties of the\ncontract can perform the contract compulsorily\
    \ without\nintroducing the third-party authority, so as to avoid the\noccurrence\
    \ of breach for contracts. That is to say, the\nimplementation of smart contract\
    \ can form consistent and\nnon-controversial operation. It not only enriches the\
    \ types\nof blockchain transactions, but also further expands the\nfunctions that\
    \ is to meet the various needs of the digital\neconomy. Although smart contracts\
    \ have powerful func-\ntions, it also has some shortcomings. At present, the main\n\
    risks faced by smart contract can be divided into three\ncategories: privacy leakage,\
    \ transaction overﬂow and\nexception, and denial of service attack, and smart\
    \ contracts\nsubject to these may never return to normal working state\n[24].\
    \ Hacker attacks have occurred many times due to the\nsecurity of smart contracts.\
    \ There are two typical cases:\none is Bitﬁnex, a bitcoin exchange, was attacked\
    \ by\nhackers, resulting in a loss of nearly $75 million [25];\nanother is the\
    \ Dao event that hackers use reentry vulnera-\nbility to attack, not only caused\
    \ a loss of more than 50\nmillion US dollars, but also directly led to the permanent\n\
    divergence of Ethereum [26]. As the increasing number of\nDApp, DApps running\
    \ on ETH, EOS, TRON and others\nare constantly attacked by hackers. The main means\
    \ of\nattacking DApps are as follows: transaction blocking,\nrollback transaction\
    \ attack, false EOS attack, cracking\nrandom number, etc. In recent years, many\
    \ security inci-\ndents also had taken place in the rapid development of the\n\
    ﬁnancial project with DeFi, and the main means of attack\nare as follows: liquid\
    \ arbitrage attack on composable\nassets, pincer attack and Re-entrancy attack.\
    \ Thus it can be\nseen that the security situation of smart contract is very\n\
    serious. There are two main reasons why smart contract is\neasy to be targeted\
    \ by attackers: one is that attacks on it\nhave higher economic value, and the\
    \ other is that contract\nloopholes will make contracts happen non-anticipatory\n\
    action that results in it losing credibility. Therefore, with\nthe increase of\
    \ smart contracts and the large-scale devel-\nopment of blockchain in the future,\
    \ the audit of contract\ncode will become a specialized ﬁeld of study [27].\n\
    The application of smart contract is still in the devel-\nopment stage at present,\
    \ and mainly in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance\nand government affairs. Smart contracts can\
    \ help to\nachieve programmable currency and ﬁnancial functions.\nFurthermore,\
    \ smart contracts can improve the level and\nefﬁciency of automatic transaction,\
    \ reduce the cost of\ntransaction and execution, and facilitate the management\
    \ of\ntransaction action. Therefore, it has attracted the attention\nof ﬁnancial\
    \ institutions and central banks. Besides, smart\ncontracts have widely application\
    \ prospects such as digital\npayment, ﬁnancial assets, cloud computing, IoT, sharing\n\
    economy [28]. The value of blockchain does not lie in a\nsingle part, but in the\
    \ interconnection and collaborative\noperation of different parts, and the smart\
    \ contract can just\nplay the central role. This means that a variety of practical\n\
    functions can be realized on blockchain, which makes the\ncurrent application\
    \ system achieve unprecedented trans-\nparency and trust [29].\n3 Basic knowledge\
    \ of smart contract\nBased on introducing the operating principle of smart\ncontract,\
    \ this chapter will further introduce the deployment\nof smart contract on Ethereum,\
    \ Hyperledger Fabric and\nEOSIO platforms from the technical level, and make a\n\
    comparative analysis of smart contract based on three\ndevelopment platforms.\n\
    3.1 Operation principle of smart contract\nThe system of smart contract automatically\
    \ executes in the\nlight of the trigger conditions contained in the information\n\
    of event description, and the core of the whole system is\nthat the smart contract\
    \ is processed by the contract module\nin the form of transaction and event. When\
    \ the transaction\nis successfully executed, the state machine of smart con-\n\
    tract determines the state of contract. If all transactions in\nthe contract are\
    \ executed in sequence, the state machine\nwill remove the contract from the latest\
    \ block. Otherwise, it\nwill continue to be saved in the latest block until the\
    \ pro-\ncessing is completed. The whole process of transaction and\nstate is automatically\
    \ completed by the system of smart\ncontract that built in the bottom of blockchain,\
    \ and all\nprocesses are transparent and tamper proof. As shown in\nFig. 4, the\
    \ life cycle of smart contract [15, 28] is mainly\n640\nWireless Networks (2022)\
    \ 28:635–690\n123\ndivided into three processes which generation, release and\n\
    execution.\nEach block in the blockchain structure of smart contract\ncontains\
    \ the following information: the hash value of the\ncurrent block, the hash value\
    \ of the previous block, the\nconsensus timestamp, and other descriptive information\n\
    [30].The operational principle of smart contract is shown in\nFig. 5, which is\
    \ mainly divided into three steps:\nStep 1: multiple users participate in the\
    \ formulation of\nsmart contract, and the contract is programmed into\ncode.\n\
    Furthermore,\nthe\nsystem\nof\nsmart\ncontract\ntransmits the contract into the\
    \ blockchain network after\nthe participants sign with their private keys.\nStep\
    \ 2: the contract is spread to each node in the whole\nblockchain network through\
    \ P2P. The speciﬁc process is\nthat the veriﬁcation node is responsible for storing\
    \ and\npackaging the contract, and the contract is veriﬁed and\nwill be ﬁnally\
    \ written into the blockchain when the\nconsensus is reached. Moreover, the main\
    \ content of\nveriﬁcation is whether the private key signature of\nparticipants\
    \ matches the account.\nStep 3: smart contract will check the state of the\nautomaton\
    \ regularly, and the transaction will be executed\nNegotiation of \nContract Content\n\

    relevant blockchain data will be obtained if all the\ntransactions in the contract\
    \ are executed, or else the\nexecution will continue until the completion.\n3.2\
    \ Deployment of smart contract\nAlthough the deployment of smart contract is compiled\
    \ and\nexecuted on the graphical interface, the architecture and\nprinciple of\
    \ its deployment are different when it runs on\ndifferent\nplatforms.\nThis\n\
    Section\nwill\nintroduce\nthe\ndeployment process of smart contract in different\
    \ platforms\nfrom the technical level.\n3.2.1 Ethereum\nThe deployment process\
    \ of Ethereum smart contract is\nshown in Figs. 6 and 7 is an example of a trading\
    \ smart\ncontract code written using Solidity. It is needed to build\nappropriate\n\
    development\nenvironment\nand\ndownload\ndevelopment tools before deploying smart\
    \ contract. The\ndevelopment environment is mainly composed of EVM,\nSolidity\
    \ and Geth. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the\nrunning environment of smart\
    \ contract, Solidity is the\nprogramming language of smart contract for EVM, and\n\
    Geth (Go Ethereum) is the interactive command console\n[31]. And the development\
    \ tools to be downloaded are\nshown in Table 1. In addition, since the deployment\
    \ of\nsmart contract on Ethereum mainly depends on the Ether-\neum node of Geth\
    \ that running in the background, so that it\nis necessary to build an Ethereum\
    \ network to run the node.\nThe speciﬁc process is as follows: the Geth console\
    \ uses\nthe ﬁle that its name is genesis.json to create Genesis block,\nand it\
    \ provides simultaneously the directory to save the\nblock data and account private\
    \ key. It initializes the net-\nwork by executing commands, reading ﬁles and storing\n\

    the construction of the node running environment.\nSmart contract deploys bytecodes\
    \ to Ethereum network\nthrough the transaction way, and a new smart contract\n\
    account will be generated every time if it is successfully\ndeployed. During deployment,\
    \ the smart contract code\nwritten in the Solidity language is transformed into\
    \ EVM\nbytecodes through smart contract compiler SOLC [32].\nAfter that, smart\
    \ contract is created through a transaction\nthat contains key information such\
    \ as the creator’s account\nnumber, and the content and address of smart contract.\
    \ It\nshould be noted that the generation of smart contract\naddress takes the\
    \ creator’s account number and the number\nof transactions sent as random number\
    \ input, and creates a\nnew address as the account number through the Kecca-256\n\
    encryption algorithm. Furthermore, it is needed to store\ndata that contains binary\
    \ codes of contract, address of\nsmart contract and wallet balance in the blockchain.\n\

    Wireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n643\n123\nEthereum provides a set of interface\
    \ call based on JSON-\nRPC (Remote Procedure Call) [33]. In addition, through\n\
    interface provided by Geth such as JSON-RPC and API\n(Application Binary Interface),\
    \ the wallet client on EVM\ncan also send the binary code of smart contract to\
    \ Ethereum\nnetwork, but the data transmission needs to meet JSON\nformat. After\
    \ the contract is deployed to the Ethereum\nnetwork and the veriﬁcation of the\
    \ whole network nodes,\nthe data will be written to each blockchain managed by\n\
    Geth. And the functions in the smart contract are called\nthrough the Web3.js\
    \ library and ABI interface to read and\nmodify the data. Gas [34, 35] will be\
    \ consumed as a service\ncharge when testing and deploying DApp or smart contract\n\
    on the actual Ethereum network. A certain amount of gas\nwill be charged for each\
    \ transaction on Ethereum, and the\npurpose is to conﬁne that the workload required\
    \ to execute\nthe transaction, and pay for the execution. Due to the\nlimited\
    \ storage capacity of each block of Ethereum, swarm\ncan be used as distributed\
    \ storage to hash the stored content\nand generate proof of the blockchain.\n\
    3.2.2 Hyperledger fabric\nThe smart contract of Hyperledger Fabric is usually\n\
    deployed in the form of chaincode. Chaincode is the carrier\nof business, and\
    \ is mainly responsible for the speciﬁc\nbusiness logic, in other words, encapsule\
    \ the transaction\ndeﬁnition and the processing logic into an interface. In\n\
    addition, it can initialize and manage the ledger book status\nby applying the\
    \ submitted transaction [36]. Chaincode is\nthe middle point between the application\
    \ layer and the\nbottom layer of blockchain, and the execution environment\nof\
    \ each chaincode is a protected stand-alone container\n(Docker),\nwhich\nis\n\
    isolated\nfrom\nthe\noperation\nof\nendorsement node. Chaincode can be developed\
    \ by the\ndevelopment language such as Go, Java and Node.js.\nThe deployment process\
    \ of Hyperledger Fabric smart\ncontract is shown in Figs. 8 and 9 is a java code\
    \ example of\nthe invoke method of chaincode. It is necessary to build the\ndevelopment\
    \ environment of chaincode before deployment\n[37], that is to download Fabric\
    \ components and the\nDocker images that are related to the chaincodes developed\n\
    with Go or Java and node conﬁguration. And the key\ncomponents and corresponding\
    \ functions of Fabric [38] are\nshown in Table 2. As a command-line tool, Docker\
    \ Com-\npose mainly implements batch processing in containers,\nwhich can help\
    \ build Fabric networks. Fabric network is\nmainly built by generating the node\
    \ certiﬁcate, creating the\nﬁle of genesis block and the channel ﬁle, writing\
    \ conﬁgu-\nration ﬁles corresponding to Orderer nodes and Peer nodes.\nAfter setting\
    \ up the development environment, it is\nrequired to install chaincodes on each\
    \ peer node to execute\ntransactions and endorsement transactions, and instantiate\n\
    chaincodes on Channel. As an important part of Fabric,\nchannel has the function\
    \ of data isolation, and each channel\ncan have an independent ledger and smart\
    \ contract. The\nprocess of instantiating chaincodes on Channel is as fol-\nlows:\
    \ ﬁnd the compressed package according to the\nparameter combination ﬁle name,\
    \ compile the package\nafter decompressed, generate the container and start it,\
    \ and\nthe peer node returns the processing results, submit the\norder and generate\
    \ blocks. Init method, one of the methods\nthat chaincode must implement, it needs\
    \ to be called to\nperform initialization after chaincode ﬁnished deployment\n\
    and received the transaction of instantiation or upgrade, so\nthat chaincode can\
    \ successfully perform the necessary\ninitialization\noperations\nthat\nincludes\n\
    initializing\nthe\napplication state. Each chaincode program must implement\n\
    the chaincode interface, because the methods in the inter-\nface\nwill\nbe\ncalled\n\
    when\nit\nresponds\nto\nincoming\nFig. 7 Solidity codes example of Ethereum smart\

    \ contract and stores the\nrequest ledger of contract action in the blockchain.\
    \ Each\nEOS smart contract has a set of operations and types, which\nAction represents\
    \ a single operation, Transaction is a col-\nlection of one or more Action, and\
    \ Type deﬁnes the\nrequired content and structure used in the contract. Fur-\n\
    thermore, EOS smart contracts communicate with each\nother by the communication\
    \ architecture based on mes-\nsages and shared memory database, and it has two\
    \ main\ninteraction modes of it: Inline and Deferred [39]. The\nInline mode mainly\
    \ implements the real-time calling\nsequence of all actions in the transaction,\
    \ while the\nDeferred mode mainly implements the delayed execution\nof some actions\
    \ that are not executed immediately. EOSIO\nsmart contracts are mostly developed\
    \ in C?? language,\nexecuted by CPU, NET and RAM, and EOSIO based\nblockchain\
    \ usually uses WebAssembly (WASM) that a\nnew type of code to execute user developed\
    \ applications or\ncode [40]. More particularly, when the transaction of\nEOSIO\
    \ based blockchain storage contract is in progress,\nthe corresponding smart contract\
    \ set must attached the\nRicardian Contract [41].\nThe deployment process of EOSIO\
    \ smart contract is\nshown in Figs. 10 and 11 is a C?? code example of EOS\nsmart\
    \ contract. EOS Studio is a graphical integrated\ndevelopment environment (IDE)\
    \ for EOSIO DApp devel-\nopment, and Docker is the running environment of EOS\n\
    smart contract [42]. The development environment needs\nto be built before deploying\
    \ the EOS smart contract. Aside\nfrom downloading the main tools of EOSIO as shown\
    \ in\nTable 3, it is also needed to install node.js package, EOSJS\nand scatter.\
    \ EOSJS is a method library for interaction with\nEOSIO blockchain network, and\
    \ scatter is a wallet front-\nend plug-in based on EOS. After that, it can start\
    \ the Cleos\ncommand line to deploy the EOS smart contract after\nconﬁguring the\
    \ Docker Compose ﬁle. Firstly, it is required\nto load Eosio.bios, the basic IO\
    \ smart contract. It is the\nbasic system of many basic actions in EOS, and directly\n\
    control the resource allocation and have access to API, thus\nit is necessary\
    \ to ensure the effective execution of basic IO\nintelligent contract. On the\
    \ public blockchain, Eosio.bios\nwill manage the token that has raised and be\
    \ raised to\nreserve bandwidth for CPU, memory and network activi-\nties. When\
    \ the basic IO smart contract has ﬁnished loading,\nby signing the corresponding\
    \ action of a function call in the\nsmart contract through the private key of\
    \ the account\nFig. 9 Java codes example of invoking method of chaincode\nTable\

    \ methods to call some RPC inter-\nfaces, the curl (a transfer tool) is the simplest\
    \ way to call\nthis interface. DApp can interact with other interfaces\nthrough\
    \ RPC interface, and then achieve the goal that is to\nexecute transaction by\
    \ calling smart contract.\n3.3 Comparative analysis of smart contracts\nbased\
    \ on three development platforms\nBlockchain is a distributed system that can\
    \ realize data\ncannot be tampered and trusted calculation results through\nmulti-party\
    \ storage and calculation [43]. And the smart\ncontract must have two properties\
    \ at the same time based\non such characteristics: Certainty and Termination.\
    \ The\nrunning results of different nodes may not be consistent if\nthe smart\
    \ contract with the uncertain, which will lead to the\nconsensus not being reached\
    \ and the network stagnates.\nSimilarly, the node will spend inﬁnite time and\
    \ resources to\nrun it if the smart contract is never stopped, and it will also\n\
    lead to the stagnation of the network. Blockchain smart\ncontract has strict requirements\
    \ on the operating environ-\nment. The fundamental reason is that the current\
    \ smart\ncontract is running under the key that is Turing’s com-\npleteness, and\
    \ it must meet the requirements of certainty\nand termination [44].\nThe smart\
    \ contract will run in multiple nodes of the\nblockchain network, and the detailed\
    \ design of its speciﬁc\ndevelopment will be different in different operating\
    \ envi-\nronments. In Table 4, based on the three smart contract\ndevelopment\
    \ platforms that is Ethereum, Hyperledger\nFabric and EOSIO, we will compare and\
    \ analyze them\nfrom the implementation details, such as the programming\nlanguage,\
    \ the consensus mechanism and the underlying\ndatabase. Furthermore, we will also\
    \ introduce the appli-\ncation environments of the smart contract based on dif-\n\
    ferent platforms. Moreover, we will also discuss the\nmethods of solving the problems\
    \ of two characteristics that\nare certainty and termination, and further summarizes\
    \ the\nexisting problems and corresponding solutions of the three\ndevelopment\
    \ platforms [45–49].\n4 DAG-based blockchain smart contract\nAs NXT community\
    \ proposed to change the linked storage\nstructure of blockchain into DAG (directed\
    \ acyclic graph)\nblocks [50], researchers began to explore DAG technology\n[51].\
    \ At present, the most representative DAG-based\nblockchain projects mainly include\
    \ IOTA, Byteball, Nano,\nHashGraph and InterValue, which adopts the concept of\n\
    blockless and creatively use the data structure of DAG.\nHowever, it requires\
    \ technological innovation to realize the\nsmart contract function of DAG-based\
    \ blockchain due to\nDAG does not take blocks as the underlying architecture\n\
    [52]. The more mature projects in the development of\nsmart contract are Hashgraph\
    \ and InterValue. Byteball only\nsupports simple declarative smart contracts that\
    \ are not\ncomplete in Turing. IOTA also launched the Alpha version\nFig. 11 C??\

    limit. With the increase in participants, the network\nalso tends to be stable,\
    \ and the transaction conﬁrmation\nspeed is faster and faster. There is no need\
    \ to wait for\ndata synchronization from other nodes. Therefore,\nDAG is very\
    \ suitable for IoT projects.\n3.\nHigher security: due to the data structure of\
    \ DAG, if a\nnode needs to be modiﬁed, the corresponding in-degree\nand out-degree\
    \ also needs to be modiﬁed, making it\nmore difﬁcult to do evil.\n4.\nLow cost:\
    \ there is no block sizes problem due to no\nminers or blocks of DAG system, and\
    \ users can\nexecute transactions in very few currencies. Further-\nmore, DAG\
    \ technology can process a large number of\ntransactions in a few seconds, which\
    \ is suitable for\nlarge transaction applications.\nHowever,\nDAG-based\nblockchain\n\
    also\nhas\nsome\nshortcomings:\n1.\nUncontrollable transaction duration: when\
    \ verifying\nhistorical transactions in a random manner without any\nsequence\
    \ rules, some transactions may not be veriﬁed\nby any other node in extreme cases,\
    \ which resulting in\nthat they will never be conﬁrmed. This also led to the\n\
    unpredictability of transaction duration.\n2.\nStrong consistency is not supported:\
    \ DAG asyn-\nchronous recording mechanism brings uncontrollable\nconsistency problems\
    \ while improves the scalability.\nAs an asynchronous operation, DAG does not\
    \ have a\nglobal sorting mechanism, which limits the types of\noperations supported\
    \ by the system. What’s more, it is\nlikely that the data stored between nodes\
    \ will deviate\nafter running for a period of time when running a smart\ncontract.\n\
    3.\nSecurity\nhas\nnot\nbeen\nveriﬁed\nby\nlarge-scale\napplications.\n4.\nLarge\
    \ scale traceability is difﬁcult: in order to track the\nrelationship between\
    \ each transaction and previous\ntransactions, the whole DAG map needs to be retrieved\n\
    and accessed at any time. In a large-scale system, the\ntraceability of its transactions\
    \ will be very complex,\nand it is almost impossible to save it all in memory\
    \ for\nreal-time update. If these data are saved from disk,\nrefreshing the weight\
    \ of each tangle in real time will\ncause a lot of random I/O, which may be solved\
    \ by\ndeploying a large number of SSDs (solid state disk).\nThe asynchronous communication\
    \ mechanism of DAG-\nbased blockchain has obvious advantages in improving\nscalability,\
    \ shortening transaction conﬁrmation time and\nreducing cost, but its security\
    \ and consistency problems\nalso need to be solved urgently. In the long run,\
    \ DAG is a\nvery novel and promising mechanism, which opens a new\ndoor\nfor\n\
    thinking\nin\nthe\nﬁeld\nof\ntraditional\ndata\nmanagement.\n4.2 Byteball\nByteball\
    \ adopts declarative smart contract with non-Turing\ncompleteness, which uses\
    \ Boolean statements to write\ncontract content, and supports Boolean operation\
    \ and data\nstorage [55]. It has the characteristics of simple deployment\nand\
    \ high security. In addition, as the infrastructure of Smart\nPayments [56], Byteball\
    \ smart contract can call Byteball\nwallet to pay transaction fees. Byteball is\
    \ different from\nother DAGs in that it implements make use of Oracle to\nsolve\
    \ the problem of transaction order. The role of Oracle\nis to track the execution\
    \ of all transactions and maintain the\nglobal order for all transactions in the\
    \ network [57]. In this\nway, by using Oracle, smart contracts that require accurate\n\
    transaction execution order can be realized.\nByteball smart contract mainly realizes\
    \ the transaction\npayment function. Its formulation and deployment are very\n\
    friendly and readable for users. Taking the test network as\nan example, we introduce\
    \ the deployment process of\nByteball smart contract, including the following\
    \ steps:\nStep 1: installs and starts the Byteball wallet, and request\ntoken\
    \ (bytes) by sending the payment addresses to the\ntest network Faucet.\nStep\
    \ 2: In essence, the formulation process of Byteball\nsmart contract is similar\
    \ to user interaction in the chat\ninterface. User need to add transactions to\
    \ their address\nbook and establish interaction channels, which is the\nbiggest\
    \ difference in traditional blockchain deployment\nand the key step of contract\
    \ formulation.\nStep 3: Both parties send payment addresses to each\nother through\
    \ the chat function provided by Byteball\nwallet. In order to ensure privacy,\
    \ the original address\nneeds to be hashed and use base32 coding algorithm to\n\
    obtain the payment address. When sending the data unit\n(Unit) with the payment\
    \ address for the ﬁrst time, the\nuser needs to put the corresponding address\
    \ deﬁnition\ninto the authors ﬁeld of the Unit.\nStep 4: Both parties use addresses\
    \ to deﬁne contract\ncontent, which is presented in the form of Boolean logic.\n\
    The simplicity of this logic is conducive to checking\nlogic vulnerabilities and\
    \ reducing the risk of security\nvulnerabilities in the process of writing contracts.\n\
    Binding the events in the physical world to the payment\nconditions through the\
    \ third-party Oracle, and the events\nare introduced into the payment execution\
    \ conditions of\nthe smart contract as a data feed. After the contract\nWireless\
    \ Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n651\n123\ncontent is formulated, it will be sent\
    \ to Byteball\nconsensus network, and the witness will verify and\nconﬁrm the\
    \ contract content.\nStep 5: Byteball can realize rich payment logic on the\n\
    payment address. The user sends a payment request in\nthe form of a complete Boolean\
    \ statement of the smart\ncontract to the transaction party, and the authenticators\n\
    ﬁeld will verify the validity of the unit. After the Unit\nveriﬁcation is passed,\
    \ if both parties of the transaction\nmade payment and received conﬁrmation information\
    \ of\npayment, then the execution of smart contract is\ncompleted.\nIn order to\
    \ better understand the simplicity brought by the\nBoolean logic of Byteball smart\
    \ contract, a code example\nof deﬁning smart contract using the payment address\
    \ is\ngiven as shown in Fig. 12. Alice and Bob respectively\ntransfer bytes to\
    \ the gambling payment address generated\nby the above deﬁnition, and sign the\
    \ generated data unit.\nWhen the exchange rate published by the exchange\nexceeds\
    \ 1.888, Alice has the right to dispose of all assets on\nthe gambling payment\
    \ address. If it does not exceed 1.888\nbefore August 25, 2021, all asset disposal\
    \ rights belong to\nBob. If both conditions are met, Alice and Bob have the\n\
    right to dispose.\nThe Boolean logic syntax of Byteball smart contract\nmakes\
    \ the contract highly readable and concise, and\nreduces the risk of contract\
    \ vulnerabilities. However, the\nfunction is relatively single, which is weaker\
    \ than the tra-\nditional blockchain smart contract function in terms of\ncompleteness.\
    \ However, because the unique function of\nByteball is its built-in secret asset\
    \ (Blackbyte) and its\npositioning is to become the ledger of the IoT, the efﬁ-\n\
    ciency and privacy in the transaction payment are the\ndevelopment focus of Byteball\
    \ smart contract.\n4.3 InterValue\nInterValue mainly solves the three problems\
    \ of the existing\npublic blockchain (low performance, high development\nthreshold\
    \ and low security). It uses the combination of\nHashnet [58, 59] consensus based\
    \ on DAG and Byzantine\nnegotiation based on random selection function (BA-VRF)\n\
    [60, 61] to realize million level TPS, which has the char-\nacteristics of anti-quantum\
    \ attack [62–64] (using NTRU-\nsign-251 signature algorithm [65]). Security is\
    \ improved\nthrough the bottom P2P anonymous communication net-\nwork and the\
    \ upper anonymous transaction method, and the\nhigh-performance smart contract\
    \ is realized by Moses\nvirtual machine (MVM). The difference between Inter-\n\
    Value and other DAGs is that it adopts the DAG ledger\n(Hashnet) of Lattice structure\
    \ [66], which each lattice in\nthe ledger represents a local full node bookkeeping\n\
    structure.\nInterValue\nadopts\nhierarchical\nthoughts\nsimilar\nto\ncomputer\
    \ storage architecture in the realization of smart\ncontract function, and supports\
    \ declarative smart contract\nwith non-Turing completeness and advanced Turing\
    \ com-\nplete smart contract. MVM is mainly used to execute these\ntwo smart contracts.\
    \ However, because the declarative\nsmart contract with non-Turing completeness\
    \ is embedded\nin the transaction data unit in JSON data format, MVM\ncannot execute\
    \ it directly. The main solution is that the\nlocal full nodes provide the compiler\
    \ function of declara-\ntive contract language, so that the contract content can\
    \ be\ncompiled into the default contract object, and then exe-\ncuted by MVM.\
    \ More particularly, the transaction handling\nfee is calculated according to\
    \ the bytes occupied by the\ncontract. The deployment process of declarative smart\n\
    contract with non-Turing completeness on InterValue is the\nsame as that of Byteball\
    \ smart contract, so we will not be\nrepeated here. Next, we will mainly introduce\
    \ InterValue\nadvanced Turing complete smart contract.\nThe advanced Turing complete\
    \ smart contract for\nInterValue is mainly used to develop DApp with more\ncomplex\
    \ program logic, but its deployment of is relatively\ndifﬁcult and is still in\
    \ the continuous improvement stage. In\norder to realize the function of Turing’s\
    \ complete smart\ncontract, InterValue adopts double-layer consensus struc-\n\
    ture and ex post rollback mechanism [67] to cancel the\nillegal output state of\
    \ smart contract, which avoids the\noccurrence of double spending transaction.\
    \ In addition, for\nreducing the development threshold, InterValue uses the\n\
    independently developed Moses high-level programming\nlanguage to write smart\
    \ contracts, and supports the secure\naccess and use of off-chain data. Advanced\
    \ Turing\nFig. 12 Code example of using\npayment address to deﬁne smart\ncontract\
    \ in Byteball\n652\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\ncomplete smart contract\
    \ is veriﬁed and executed in MVM.\nFurthermore, MVM adopts the principle of stack-based\n\
    virtual machines, which is simple and easy to use, and can\nprovide portability\
    \ of virtual machines. In terms of secu-\nrity, MVM adopts the sandbox structure\
    \ design based on\nwhite list to protect the smart contract for malicious attacks\n\
    of the system layer.\nThe advanced Turing complete smart contract is com-\npiled\
    \ into bytecode by Moses compiler and deployed to the\nInterValue network in the\
    \ form of transaction data unit.\nMVM loads data such as variables and methods\
    \ of smart\ncontract in the method area. After the smart contract is\ninstantiated,\
    \ the heap of the virtual machine will allocate\nstorage space for the instance\
    \ object of the smart contract.\nWhen the smart contract is called and executed,\
    \ MVM\ncreates a virtual machine stack in the instruction scheduling\narea, which\
    \ is mainly used to handle the stack in and out of\nthe stack frame during the\
    \ calling and completion of the\ncontract method. At this point, the program counter\
    \ will\nstore the address of the next bytecode instruction to be\nexecuted. Since\
    \ the smart contract takes the INVE Token\nconsumed by the program running as\
    \ the handling fee, a\ncertain amount of INVE Token needs to be frozen when the\n\
    user invokes the contract. With the execution of the\ninstruction, tokens are\
    \ gradually consumed until the con-\ntract is executed, and the remaining tokens\
    \ will be returned\nto the user. If all tokens are consumed before completion\
    \ of\nexecution, contract status will be rolled back to the status\nbefore execution,\
    \ and the consumed tokens will not be\nreturned. This anti-fraud mechanism can\
    \ reduce the dam-\nage to its network performance by attackers using contract\n\
    vulnerabilities.\nCompared with blockchain smart contract, the main\nadvantage\
    \ of InterValue is that it provides advanced smart\ncontracts for off-chain data\
    \ access. In terms of design,\nInterValue integrates UTXO and account transaction.\
    \ For\nthe sake of ensuring security and execution efﬁciency, the\nsmart contract\
    \ for InterValue has made a breakthrough in\nsecure access and use of off-chain\
    \ data, enhanced the\nsecurity of the virtual machine itself, and realized the\n\
    embedded formal veriﬁcation of smart contract code.\nInterValue still has great\
    \ potential for realizing highly\npractical distributed application development\
    \ in the future.\nHowever, the implementation of Turing complete smart\ncontract\
    \ with DAG still faces some challenges, such as\nestablishing the model of account\
    \ state, how to store the\ndata of account state in the network, and storage in\
    \ the\nprocess of state change.\n4.4 IOTA\nAs one of the representatives of blockchain\
    \ 3.0, IOTA aims\nat design a new transaction settlement and data asset\ncirculation\
    \ system for the IoT industry and provide scalable\nsolutions by achieving data\
    \ integrity in the economy\nbetween machines [68]. Different from other DAG-based\n\
    blockchain, it is a DAG-based blockchain based on Tangle\n[69], in which the connected\
    \ nodes are transaction data,\nand consensus is an inherent part of the system.\
    \ It can\novercome the inefﬁciency of the blockchain and has the\ncharacteristics\
    \ of zero transmission cost, unlimited expan-\nsion and data security. Moreover,\
    \ Tangle is the core tech-\nnology of IOTA, which has the characteristics of no\
    \ miner,\nrelatively loose data transmission rules and scalable data\nunits. In\
    \ IOTA, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm\n(MCMC) [70] is used to solve the problem\
    \ of selecting\nattachment points in Tangle. In order to deal with con-\nﬂicting\
    \ transactions in Tangle, Coordicide proposed fast\nprobabilistic consensus (FPC)\
    \ [71] and cellular automata\nconsensus (CC) [72]. IOTA own mechanism can prevent\n\
    heavyweight attacks [73, 74], parasitic chain attacks [75],\nsplitting attacks\
    \ [76] and quantum computing attacks.\nEarly IOTA did not have the function of\
    \ smart contract,\nand Qubic project is committed to the implementation of\nIOTA\
    \ smart contract. IOTA smart contract protocol (ISCP)\nwas ofﬁcially launched\
    \ in 2021 and is currently in Alpha\nstage. ISCP Alpha is based on Rust and Webassembly\n\
    framework, veriﬁed by Tangle, and runs in a multi chain\nenvironment protected\
    \ by Tangle. In particular, the veriﬁer\ndoes not need to verify all chains at\
    \ one-time, because the\ncreator of ISCP can choose a veriﬁcation committee that\n\
    matches its required or desired level of dispersion and\nsecurity.\nISCP is deﬁned\
    \ as an immutable state machine: each\nsmart contract has a state attached to\
    \ Tangle. This status\nincludes data such as account balance, input conditions\
    \ and\nresults over time, and each state update represents a state\ntransition\
    \ on the Tangle. The state and smart contract\nprogram code are immutable because\
    \ they are stored on the\nTangle. But it can incrementally update the state by\n\
    attaching a new transaction to the Tangle state. Tangle\nprovides veriﬁable audit\
    \ trail of state transition. Therefore,\nit will not be destroyed by malicious\
    \ nodes when state\ntransition. The deployment process of ISCP based on the\n\
    Goshimmer test network is shown in Figs. 13 and 14 is a\ncode example of ISCP\
    \ for verifying access rights (from\nGitHub). Before deployment, it is necessary\
    \ to build the\nRust development environment for ISCP, download main\ndevelopment\
    \ tools of ISCP and docker images related to\nGo language. Development tools and\
    \ corresponding func-\ntions required by ISCP are shown in Table 6. First, it\
    \ needs\nto use the Coordicide solution, use Bazel to build the\nTangle network,\
    \ and run it through Docker. The smart\ncontract written in Go language is programmed\
    \ into binary\nbytecode through Rust Compiler, and the trading assets are\ndelivered\
    \ through Trinity wallet. Solo uses Go and GCC to\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n\

    \ of smart contract. After the test is completed, the\ndeployment of smart contract\
    \ for Tangle network is real-\nized through the Cluster Tool and Wasp command\
    \ line.\nThe smart contract chain run by Wasp node signs the\ntransactions in\
    \ the smart contract when the Committee\nnode reaches a consensus result with\
    \ result essence hash, a\nset of partial BLS signatures and a timestamp. Through\n\
    WASM and IOTA API, methods within smart contracts\ncan be called to execute transactions.\
    \ It should be noted\nthat the smart contract program uses the request transaction\n\
    and the current state transaction to build the state update\nchain triggered by\
    \ the incoming request, and stores the\nprogram hash in the Tangle to ensure invariance.\n\
    The smart contract function of ISCP is similar to the\nsmart\ncontract\nfor\n\

    \ ISCP has high ﬂexi-\nbility and faces some challenges:\n1.\nState bifurcation:\
    \ the state is updated in different ways\nwhen two or more transactions are attached\
    \ to the\nTangle, which results in the problem of conﬂicting\ncopies. The current\
    \ solution is to create a unique coin-\nmixing [77] when setting the smart contract,\
    \ and\nembed the dye coin to the smart contract address, so as\nto form a non\
    \ forkable chain during the transaction and\nprevent the occurrence of state forking.\n\
    2.\nDevelopment environment upgrades: the veriﬁability\nand auditability of smart\
    \ contract still needs to be\nfurther developed. Moreover, ISCP needs to realize\n\
    binary compatibility with Ethereum ecosystem, and use\nSolidity as contract programming\
    \ language. In addi-\ntion, it is also necessary to implement the inter chains\n\
    atomic exchange framework of local and external\nblockchain.\n3.\nSecurity: it\
    \ is necessary to ensure the independence of\ngrass-roots snapshots and expand\
    \ the unlicensed chain\ncommittee venue. Keys also need to be managed for\nsecurity\
    \ and scalability.\nAlthough ISCP started late, its ﬂexibility can provide\nscalable\
    \ solutions for IoT. At present, it is still in the\ncontinuous testing stage,\
    \ and the performance and advan-\ntages in large-scale applications still needed\
    \ to be studied.\nDAG-based blockchain has great application potential for\nthe\
    \ scalability development of industrial Internet, but\nDAG-based smart contract\
    \ is still in a state of continuous\ndevelopment, with higher ﬂexibility than\

    contract based on blockchain is widely used in real life for\nits decentralization,\
    \ transparency and tamper resistance.\nTherefore, this chapter will further discuss\
    \ the research\nstatus of blockchain smart contract, and introduce the\ncurrent\
    \ application status of it from mainly seven aspects:\nﬁnancial transaction, Internet\
    \ of things, medical applica-\ntion, supply chain, EOS application research, Blockchain\n\

    \ the application research status of\nblockchain smart contract in industrial\
    \ scale and the\npotential for large-scale application in the future.\n5.1 Relative\

    \ competitiveness in blockchain technology and\nindustry. This Section will introduce\
    \ the current research\nstatus of international blockchain projects, and further\n\
    explore the application and development trend of smart\ncontract.\n5.1.1 Research\
    \ on relevant application in the world\nBlockchain is changing the application\
    \ scenarios and\noperation rules of many industries with its unique con-\nstructing\
    \ mechanism of trust along with the evolution of it\nfrom 1.0 to 3.0 era, which\
    \ is one of the indispensable\ntechnologies for the future development of digital\
    \ economy\nand the construction of new trust-system. Foreign giants\nsuch as Google,\
    \ Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, Facebook,\nAmazon and IBM have started to study blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology, and launched technical solutions and applications\n[79]. Moreover,\
    \ international open-source organizations\nsuch as Ethereum foundation and Hyperledger\
    \ community\nvigorously promote the innovative development of block-\nchain technology,\
    \ which will effectively promote the iter-\native development of it. Ecosystem\
    \ of blockchain covers\nall aspects of the global economy and society, which\n\
    blockchain technology has seen an explosive development,\nand has carried out\
    \ a series of applications in the ﬁelds,\nsuch as ﬁnancial services, supply chain\
    \ management,\nintelligent manufacturing, social welfare and health care\n[80,\
    \ 81].\nUp till now, besides 22 national governments and 73\ninternational organizations\
    \ have paid public attention to the\ndevelopment of blockchain platform software,\
    \ there are\n289,200 global start-up projects and 9635 patents have\nbeen published,\
    \ in which America (29%) and China (18%)\nare considered to the most advanced\
    \ in the development of\nglobal blockchain technology. Besides, typical of foreign\n\
    companies including IBM, Alibaba, Oracle, Mastercard,\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Cosmos,\
    \ IOTA, EOS, Ripple, Stellar\nand MOAC. The main international blockchain smart\n\
    contract projects now are shown in Table 7.\nThe application advantages of each\
    \ blockchain smart\ncontract project are as follows:\n1.\nEthereum project has\
    \ the characteristics of decen-\ntralization and high efﬁciency of contract formula-\n\
    tion. It does not rely on the participation of third-\nparty authoritative institutions\
    \ or central institutions.\nIt can complete the transaction only through smart\n\
    contracts, greatly reducing the intermediate links of\nprotocol formulation, improving\
    \ the efﬁciency of\nprotocol formulation, and is widely used in many\nprofessional\
    \ ﬁelds.\n2.\nThe design principle of Hyperledger Project is to\ndevelop a globally\
    \ deployable, scalable and powerful\nblockchain platform that is focusing on privacy\
    \ and\nfuture auditability. Hyperledger Fabric is an excel-\nlent representative\
    \ of Hyperledger project. Fabric\nuses Docker technology to package smart contracts\n\
    called chaincodes and it can run the components of\nsmart contracts in isolation\
    \ from other processes.\nAdditionally, it has the characteristics of complex\n\
    computing, pluggable modules (for enterprise cus-\ntomization and expansion) and\
    \ high recognition of\nenterprise consortium blockchain.\n3.\nEOSIO architecture\
    \ provides the account, authenti-\ncation, database and asynchronous communication,\n\
    as well as application scheduling across multiple\nCPU cores or clusters, which\
    \ aiming at achieving the\nvertical and horizontal expansion of DApp. More-\n\
    over, EOS smart contract has the advantages of no\nservice charge, high throughput,\
    \ better scalability\npotential and high performance. And EOSIO has the\nfunction\
    \ of asynchronous parallel execution of smart\ncontract, which can be better applied\
    \ to projects with\nlarge amount of data and easy network congestion.\n4.\nPolkadot\
    \ project consists of many Parachains with\npotential differentiation characteristics.\

    Wireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n657\n123\nthe smart contract platform in\
    \ Polkadot ecology is\nmainly based on WASM virtual machine, and using\nink, an\
    \ embedded domain speciﬁc language based on\nRust language, which can promote\
    \ the development\nof real cross chain interoperability.\n5.\nAs an ecological\
    \ project of Polkadot, ChainX is the\nparachains and cross-chain asset gateway\
    \ of Polka-\ndot, and is gradually evolving into the secondary\nrelay chain of\
    \ Polkadot. Currently, ChainX has\nreleased the world’s ﬁrst smart contract platform\
    \ of\nBitcoin. Being a new starting point, ChainX 2.0\nupdates all codes to Substrate\
    \ 2.0, and improves\nperformance through the consensus upgrade, on-\nchain governance,\
    \ off-chain workers, multi signature\nand other optimization methods. In the future,\
    \ it can\ntruly achieve the application development of Bitcoin\ncross-chain smart\
    \ contract.\n6.\nCertik a distributed application project that uses\nmathematical\
    \ methods (formal proof) to check the\nvulnerability of smart contracts, and it\
    \ has three\nadvantages as follows: ﬁrstly, it has a mature formal\nveriﬁcation\
    \ framework and a complete theoretical\nbasis; secondly, the complex smart contract\
    \ can be\nsubdivided into different modules for distributed\nveriﬁcation based\
    \ on smart tag and hierarchical\ndecomposition technology, which greatly improves\n\
    the ﬂexibility and efﬁciency of security veriﬁcation\nand has high scalability;\
    \ thirdly, it is to complete\ncontract veriﬁcation automatically through the ver-\n\
    iﬁcation engine and audit algorithm, which has a\nhigh degree of automation. Furthermore,\
    \ Certik\nAutoScan Engine (case), the ﬁrst generation of\nhigh-performance automatic\
    \ detection engine for\nsmart contracts, has been released at present, which\n\
    further promotes the development of smart contracts\nsecurity.\n7.\npLIBRA is\
    \ a Web3 foundation project (Grant Plan).\nIt is developed based on the framework\
    \ of Substrate,\nand the main highlight is the smart privacy contract\nthat connects\
    \ Libra blockchain to Polkadot for cross-\nchain interaction, which can realize\
    \ the security of\ncross-chain interaction and sharing of smart contract.\nAs\
    \ a representative application of Phala.Network,\npLIBRA is a conﬁdential smart\
    \ contract platform\nbased on Trusted Computing Technology (TEE), and\nits goal\
    \ is to provide enterprises and users with the\ninfrastructure of conﬁdential\
    \ computing and data\nprotection.\n8.\nANTCHAIN has the world’s ﬁrst commercially\n\
    available on-chain privacy protection technology.\nIts core technology includes\
    \ data encryption trans-\nmission protocol, data encryption storage protocol,\n\
    remote authentication and key agreement protocol\nand a smart contract engine\
    \ based on TEE. The\nplatform provides a stable, efﬁcient and secure\nexecution\
    \ environment of Turing-complete smart\ncontract. At present, a customized hardware\
    \ proces-\nsor, ANTCHAIN All-in-one Machine, has been\ndeveloped for blockchain\
    \ smart contract.\n9.\nThe biggest feature of the Matic project is Matic\nNetwork.\
    \ Matic Network is the only blockchain\nproject supported and incubated by Coinbase\
    \ and\nBinance. It carries out off-chain transactions and\nsmart contract expansion\
    \ through the side chain, in\nwhich the solution of smart contract expansion is\n\
    realized by using the side chain supported by the\nsecurity of Plasma framework,\
    \ and without high\ntransaction costs. Besides, Matic adopts a truly\ndecentralized\
    \ mechanism, and uses its own technol-\nogy and highly autonomous ecology to create\
    \ a\nLayer2 solution to adapt to the upgrade of Ethereum.\n10.\nThe technical\
    \ deﬁnition of RSK is a side chain of\nbitcoin, which uses to continue the ecology\
    \ of\nbitcoin. RVM, the virtual machine of RSK, has\nTuring completeness of smart\
    \ contract, which is\nhighly compatible with Ethereum’s EVM, so that\nEthereum\
    \ DApp can seamlessly switch to the smart\ncontract platform of RSK. Moreover,\
    \ RSK using the\ndouble token mechanism of RIF and RBTC to pay\nthe service charge\
    \ can make the deployment cost of\nsmart contract lower and the efﬁciency higher.\
    \ And\nthe operating system RIF OS developed by RIF\nlaboratory can better meet\
    \ the needs of the future\ndevelopment of Bitcoin ecology.\n11.\nXuperChain is\
    \ a high-performance, high concurrency\nblockchain 3.0 solution independently\
    \ developed by\nBaidu. It has four core technologies: in-chain parallel\ntechnology,\
    \ pluggable consensus mechanism, the\npermission system of account and integrated\
    \ smart\ncontract. Among them, in the aspect of smart\ncontract, XuperModel, the\
    \ original data model, is\nused to maximize the contract parallel execution\n\
    ability, from this can support contract resource audit\nand shield the operating\
    \ system interface to ensure\nsecurity. At the same time, it can extend the multi\n\
    development language of contracts and the access\nability of resources on the\
    \ chain to achieve scalabil-\nity, and has the isolation property that different\n\
    contract calls do not affect each other.\n12.\nLiquidapps is committed to developing\
    \ a side chain\n(DApp Network) based on EOSIO. Its R & D\nachievements such as\
    \ LiquidAccounts Service, Liq-\nuidOracles and Zeus development kit can make the\n\
    development of smart contract and DApp more\nsimple and low cost, with the characteristics\
    \ of easy\nuse and strong scalability. Additionally, vRAM, the\n658\nWireless\
    \ Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\nproposed storage solution by Liquidapps, has\
    \ the\nadvantages of low storage cost, large storage capac-\nity and ofﬂine processing\
    \ with chain integrity, so as\nto promote the large-scale development and imple-\n\
    mentation of DApp.\n13.\nAnnChain is a new consortium blockchain based on\nPBFT\
    \ algorithm, which innovatively provides a more\ncomplete smart contract, hybrid\
    \ consensus and\nencrypted computing system, and further improves\nthe privacy\
    \ protection and computing capability of\nthe new generation of public blockchain\
    \ by the\noriginal encrypted computing layer. Moreover, its\nsmart contract has\
    \ the advantages of strong enforce-\nability, fast execution speed and built-in\
    \ storage\nmodel. And data security is improved through the\ncombination\nof\n\
    ‘‘Oracle-Business\nPreprocessor-\nSmart Contract Processor’’ and hardware solutions\n\
    such as SGX, which is suitable for application\nscenarios with high security requirements\
    \ and high-\nfrequency ﬁnancial trading.\n5.1.2 Application status and development\
    \ trend\nof blockchain smart contract\nThe reason why blockchain can subvert the\
    \ tradition lies in\nthe three characteristics of data tamper proof and trace-\n\
    ability, collective data maintenance and multi centralized\ndecision-making formed\
    \ by the integration of the ﬁve\nelements that are two structures, two algorithms\
    \ and one\ncontract, as well as the ﬁve full genes of that are full air-\nspace,\
    \ full process, full scene, full analysis and full value\n[82–84]. The application\
    \ of blockchain can be divided into\ntwo categories based on the above characteristics:\
    \ one is\nthe extension of digital currency application, collectively\nreferred\
    \ to as Digital Assets; the other is in the real econ-\nomy, government, medical,\
    \ ﬁnancial, agricultural, supply-\nchain and other ﬁelds. However, there are still\
    \ pain points\nin the application process as an emerging technology.\nNowadays,\
    \ there are still three problems in the application\nresearch of blockchain smart\
    \ contract as follows:\n1.\nTernary Paradox: the balance of scalability, distribu-\n\
    tion and security;\n2.\nSafety Supervision: blockchain projects are not only\n\
    blooming everywhere but good and bad are intermin-\ngled, which brings about the\
    \ supervision is difﬁcult;\n3.\nConsensus Cost: the consensus mechanism of tradition\n\
    frequently shows that if the cost does not go up, the\nefﬁciency will decline.\n\
    At present, there are some problems in the research of\nblockchain in China.\n\
    It is not easy to obtain consensus on the chain at this\nstage due to the greater\
    \ the degree of freedom, the higher\nthe cost of consensus [85, 86]. Nevertheless,\
    \ with the\nstrong support of the government and the unremitting\nefforts of the\
    \ international blockchain research team,\nblockchain technology has developed\
    \ rapidly. Industry\ngiants have developed valuable blockchain technologies,\n\
    and committed to solve the existing problems of block-\nchain, which injected\
    \ fresh blood into the development of\nglobal blockchain.\nAs a kind of distributed-data\
    \ technology of value\nInternet, blockchain has ﬂourished from the bottom and\n\
    became a new generation of information technology highly\nvalued by governments\
    \ all over the world. Blockchain\ntechnology needs to get rid of the identity\
    \ of just a kind of\ndistributed-accounting technology, and not only fully\nintegrate\
    \ with emerging information technologies such as\nbig data, IoT and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence, but also constantly\npenetrates into application scenarios of\
    \ various industries,\nso as to promote application innovation under the inte-\n\
    gration of blockchain and new technologies [87]. In terms\nof innovation and application,\
    \ it can attach importance to\nresearch and development from four aspects as following:\n\
    1.\nTo promote the governance innovation of smart\nsociety;\n2.\nTo promote the\
    \ development of industrial Internet and\nintelligent manufacturing;\n3.\nTo promote\
    \ the transformation of the energy utilization\nand the energy industry;\n4.\n\
    Facilitating to build a new engine for the development\nof the ﬁnancial industry.\n\
    Ecological construction of global blockchain ecology is\nstill in the stages of\
    \ development, but as the key devel-\nopment strategies of various countries,\
    \ the research value\nof it is immeasurable. International organizations continue\n\
    to promote the creation of blockchain ecology. The open-\nsource projects of blockchain\
    \ represented by Bitcoin,\nEthereum and EOS have been continuously promoted,\n\
    making the industrial ecology of blockchain maturation\n[88]. The Hyperledger\
    \ Project initiated by the Linux\nfoundation has become a key representative of\
    \ the block-\nchain industry ecology. According to the current situation,\nthe\
    \ future development trend of blockchain-smart contract\ncan be divided into ﬁve\
    \ aspects:\n1.\nPragmatic governance model. Namely, develop more\nmodels and methods\
    \ of governance to ensure security\nand controllability of blockchain markets;\n\
    2.\nImprove the high degree of interconnection between\ndifferent\nchains,\nmeanwhile,\n\
    the\ninteroperability\nbetween chains needs to realize on the premise of\nensuring\
    \ security;\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n659\n123\n3.\nAdjacent technology\
    \ is closely combined with block-\nchain to create greater advantages. In other\
    \ words,\nintegrate emerging technologies (such as IoT) with\nblockchain to improve\
    \ the closeness of blockchain\napplication scenarios;\n4.\nUse veriﬁcation tools\
    \ to crack down on fraudulent data\nsources. This needs to conﬁrm the fraudulent\
    \ data and\nensure that the data got or sent on the Internet will not\nbe obtained\
    \ or tampered maliciously;\n5.\nContinuously explore and improve the digital currency\n\
    ecosystem to achieve the new development of central\nbanks in the ﬁeld of digital\
    \ currency.\nThe innovative development and wide application of\nblockchain technology\
    \ had become an important core of\nthe transformation of social life and the production\
    \ mode to\ndigital. Whether blockchain can get higher development\ndepends on\
    \ three factors: cognition, technology and policy.\nToday, the application of\
    \ blockchain technology has\nextended to ﬁelds [89, 90], such as epidemic-control,\n\
    intelligent health care, digital ﬁnance, energy blockchain,\nIoT, intelligent\
    \ manufacturing, supply chain management,\ndigital asset trading and others. Certainly,\
    \ the implemen-\ntation of the main functions of blockchain, such as dis-\ntributed\n\
    shared-ledger,\ncryptographic\nalgorithm,\nthe\nconsensus\nmechanism,\nincentive-layer,\n\
    contract-layer,\ndata-layer, network-layer, as well as traceability, prov-\nability,\
    \ persistence and authoritative guarantee, is also the\nkey technology and challenge\
    \ [91, 92].\n5.2 Blockchain oracle\nAs a closed system environment with deterministic,\n\
    blockchain is separated from the real world [93]. The\nblockchain can only obtain\
    \ the data in the chain but not out\nof the chain, which the main reason is that\
    \ smart contract\ncan only passively accept but cannot actively obtain the\ndata\
    \ out of the chain. In addition, it is mostly used for the\ntransaction processing\
    \ of digital assets when blockchain is\napplied to ﬁnance, and the required data\
    \ comes from within\nthe chain. However, non-ﬁnancial applications such as\nsupply-chain\
    \ and IoT need to obtain off-chain data (that is,\nthe data of the real world)\
    \ when carrying out, and smart\ncontracts do not support external requests. Therefore,\n\
    Blockchain Oracle [94] came into being. Blockchain Ora-\ncle is the link of data\
    \ exchange between blockchain and the\nreal world, and essentially is the interface\
    \ and the only way\nfor smart contract to interact with the external world [95].\n\
    Being an off-chain component, Blockchain Oracle trans-\nmits the off-chain data\
    \ as the trigger condition of smart\ncontract to the blockchain through a speciﬁc\
    \ communica-\ntion channel (such as platform or sensor), which providing\ndata\
    \ services for smart contract and making it can respond\nto the real world that\
    \ with uncertainty.\nThe operative mechanism of Blockchain Oracle is\nshown in\
    \ Fig. 15. In order to ensure the determinacy of the\nblockchain, smart contract\
    \ usually can only access the data\npreviously stored on the blockchain, but cannot\
    \ use\nBlockchain\nUser Smart Contract\nOracle Smart Contract\nSend Request\n\

    \ mechanism of Blockchain Oracle\n660\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\n\
    external data. Therefore, Oracle is needed as an off-chain\ndata transmission\
    \ tool to achieve data interaction when\nblockchain is applied in the real world\
    \ [96]. On the\nblockchain, the user smart contract sends the request to the\n\
    Oracle smart contract, and the Oracle smart contract with\nthe function of automation\
    \ runs the corresponding Oracle\nmechanism according to the request in order to\
    \ interact\nwith the external API. Furthermore, the external system\ncan directly\
    \ transfer data with the blockchain if a single\nOracle mechanism is running,\
    \ but if running multiple dis-\ntributed Oracle mechanisms, it is needed to use\
    \ the con-\nsensus agreement to reach the ﬁnal outcomes, and transfer\nthe ﬁnal\
    \ outcomes to external API to achieve the interac-\ntion of distributed data.\
    \ Once the automated Blockchain\nOracle is successfully deployed, it will communicate\
    \ with\nthe off-chain data source to collect the required data, and\nthe requester\
    \ will be able to see the data when executing\nthe user smart contract. Blockchain\
    \ generally needs the\nassistance of Oracle in the implementation of practical\n\
    applications, such as supply-chain and Internet of things,\ntherefore, the off-chain\
    \ data sources are mainly web servers\nand physical sensors.\nBlockchain Oracle\
    \ is a bridge for data interaction\nbetween blockchain and the real world, and\
    \ all DApps that\nneed off-chain data interaction require applying Oracle\n[97].\
    \ At present, smart contract is developing connectivity\nunder the chain, and\
    \ Blockchain Oracle as the core tech-\nnology lays a solid foundation for the\
    \ next generation of\nsmart contract [98]. However, there are few research pro-\n\
    jects in the blockchain Oracle ﬁeld, and the solutions of\neach project are different.\
    \ The current mainstream Block-\nchain Oracle projects are shown in Table 8.\n\
    The analysis of typical Oracle projects in Table 8 is as\nfollows:\n1.\nChainLink\
    \ is the ﬁrst decentralized Oracle solution in\nEthereum, as well as the only\
    \ decentralized Oracle\nnetwork with high reliability that is online in the main\n\
    network. Its advantages include decentralized Oracle\nand data source, multiple\
    \ data aggregation methods\n(data source, node operator and Oracle network\naggregation),\
    \ TEE (privacy computing and ofﬂine\ncomputing), the reputation system, Reward-Punish-\n\
    ment mechanism and the threshold signature. How-\never, there are some shortcomings,\
    \ such as high cost of\nchain aggregation, poor expansibility and easy central-\n\
    ization of reputations based system.\n2.\nDOS Network, an extensible Layer-2 protocol,\
    \ is\nmainly used to solve the consistency of data feedback\nand delivery from\
    \ the chain to the smart contract, and\nhelp the smart contract to perform the\
    \ tasks of large-\nscale throughput computing that cannot be carried out\non the\
    \ chain. It has two advantages: one is that not only\nensures the security of\
    \ the network in logic-design, but\nalso uses the means of economic incentives\
    \ to restrict\nthe malicious nodes; another is to improve the\nefﬁciency by dividing\
    \ the node group into the engine\ngroup of random number and the working group.\
    \ But\nthere is a problem that high cost of computation when\nthe amount of computation\
    \ is large due to the use of\nThreshold Cryptography scheme.\n3.\nProvable is\
    \ a centralized Oracle with authenticity\nproof, that is to prove that the data\
    \ obtained from the\noriginal data source is true and not tampered with. Its\n\
    advantage is that the data provider can be compatible\nwith the blockchain protocol\
    \ without modifying its\nservice, and smart contract can directly access the data\n\
    from the website or API, which has the characteristics\nof cost-effective, good\

    protocol of Layer-2, which is dedicated to provide a\ndecentralized Oracle with\
    \ faster contract-calls, cheaper\nservice-charge, easier integration and scalability\
    \ for the\nblockchain. And its advantage is to ensure the gener-\nation of reliable,\
    \ accurate and secure data sources\nthrough the unique multi token model and equity\n\
    pledge mechanism. However, Band Protocol still has a\nlot of room for development\
    \ as Web3 is still in its early\nstage.\n5.\nOraclechain is the ﬁrst decentralized\
    \ Oracle solution on\nEOS, providing a platform for efﬁcient access to data\n\
    outside the chain in the EOS ecosystem. And its\nadvantage is that it adopts the\
    \ self-developed PoRD\nmechanism, which can not only realize the functions of\n\
    forecasting market applications such as Augur and\nGnosis, but also support the\
    \ smart contract business\nwith higher frequency access requirements for off-\n\
    chain data. In addition, the service of random number\nproposed by OracleChain\
    \ effectively solves the prob-\nlems of transparency and efﬁciency. But the system\
    \ of\nsingle reputation is prone to centralization.\nCurrently, the mainstream\
    \ Oracle type is distributed\nOracle, which mainly adopts the following four methods\
    \ to\nsolve problems that Conﬁdence-and Security-Building\n[99–101]:\n1.\nMultiple\
    \ Oracle nodes: multiple nodes need to perform\ntogether the request processing\
    \ of Oracle data in order\nto prevent the trust problem of single node Oracle,\
    \ but\nrequiring solving the problem of data inconsistency by\ndata aggregation\
    \ method. Furthermore, common aggre-\ngation algorithms include BFT consensus\
    \ algorithm or\nthe threshold signature algorithm.\n2.\nSubmission-Disclosure\
    \ mechanism: Data broadcast\nbetween Oracle nodes will bring Free-loading problem,\n\
    which is a Oracle does not obtain data by accessing the\ndata source, but copies\
    \ the responses of other Oracle.\nThe Free-loading problem can be solved through\
    \ the\nSubmission-Disclosure mechanism. In addition, the\nOracle node submits\
    \ data answers in two stages, which\nthe answers submitted are encrypted in the\
    \ ﬁrst stage,\nand all the answers are decrypted only after receiving\nenough\
    \ Oracle answers.\n3.\nMultiple data sources/trusted single data source: it is\n\
    difﬁcult to solve the integrity of data source owing to\nthe unsafe data may give\
    \ rise to Oracle to return an\nerror result Using multiple data sources to access\
    \ data\ncan prevent the evils of a few data sources to a certain\nextent, but\
    \ this approach is not universal because not\nevery piece of data has multiple\
    \ external data sources.\n4.\nBeneﬁt distribution: decentralized Oracle needs\
    \ to\ndesign a set of incentive mechanism to reward and\npunish Oracle nodes.\
    \ In the problem of Free-loading,\nonce the node is found to have Free-loading\
    \ behavior\nin the Submission-Disclosure stage, it is necessary to\ndeduct its\
    \ pledged deposit according to a certain\nproportion.\nThe next generation of\
    \ smart contracts will contain two\nequally\nimportant\nmodules\nwith\ndifferent\n\
    functions,\nnamely, on-chain and off-chain modules. The on-chain\nmodule refers\
    \ to the blockchain, which has the character-\nistics of high reliability and\
    \ decentralization, and can\nhandle legal disputes, payment on the chain and other\n\
    transactions that need to be highly transparent. The off-\nchain module can be\
    \ implemented through Blockchain\nOracle, and developers can use Oracle network\
    \ to complete\nvarious off-chain tasks, which includes two-way data\ntransmission\
    \ between the on-chain contract and external\nsystem, and conﬁguration of computing\
    \ capability based on\nthe speciﬁc requirements of both parties. Thus it can be\n\
    seen that Blockchain Oracle provides many key solutions\nfor developers and promotes\
    \ the development of the next\ngeneration of smart contracts. For all that, Blockchain\n\
    Oracle still needs to pay attention to the following three\nfactors in practical\
    \ application:\n1.\nIntegrity. It ensures the transmission of information to\n\
    complete, accuracy and credibility, and has not been\nmaliciously damaged or tampered\
    \ with. Furthermore,\nintegrity, it is mainly guaranteed through multiple data\n\
    sources, multiple Oracle, the reputation system, trusted\nexecution environment\
    \ and the authenticity proof.\n2.\nConﬁdentiality. It refers to the content of\
    \ requests from\nsmart contract to Oracle that will not be disclosed.\nMoreover,\
    \ for conﬁdentiality, the Oracle node uses the\npublic key to encrypt the content\
    \ of requests, as well as\nrestricts the information ﬂow of Oracle, and only\n\
    decrypts when querying the information source.\n3.\nAvailability. It refers to\
    \ the ability to get the required\ninformation in time when accessing data through\n\
    Oracle, and includes achieving the function of censor-\nship resistance. Furthermore,\
    \ decentralized Oracle can\neffectively resolve the problem of availability.\n\
    With the continuous development of blockchain practical\napplication, the demand\
    \ for off-chain data is growing, and\nthe importance of Oracle is becoming more\
    \ and more\nprominent. In order to ensure availability, Blockchain\nOracle not\
    \ only helps developers solve the issues of\ninteroperability, trust and scalability,\
    \ but also requires\nsolving the problems of private data security and anti-\n\
    hacker attack. In addition, being an important infrastructure\nof blockchain,\
    \ whether Blockchain Oracle can indeed and\ncomprehensively develop depends on\
    \ the demand and\npayment ability of the contract on the chain for the off-\n\
    662\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\nchain data [101]. In the long haul,\
    \ Oracle will be the\nintegrator of all kinds of data, information, credit and\
    \ assets\nin the real world. Moreover, the correctness of data, the\ndecentralization\
    \ of technology implementation and the\nintellectualization of module script that\
    \ Oracle offers will\nhave a signiﬁcant impact on the connection between the\n\
    future blockchain world and the real world. Therefore,\nOracle Technology still\
    \ needs to be continuously devel-\noped and improved.\n5.3 Application status\n\
    Blockchain smart contract has broad application area, as\nshown in Fig. 16. According\
    \ to Fig. 16, this Section will\ntake Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric development\
    \ plat-\nforms as examples to introduce the relevant application of\nblockchain\
    \ smart contract in the ﬁelds of ﬁnancial trans-\nactions, IoT, medical application\
    \ and supply-chain. In\naddition, we also discuss the ﬁelds current application\
    \ and\nproblems existing of EOS in the development stage, and\nfurther discuss\
    \ the applications of blockchain smart con-\ntracts in Blockchain Oracle and other\
    \ ﬁelds.\n5.3.1 Financial transactions\nIn recent years, blockchain technology\
    \ has been the focus\nof attention of central banks and ﬁnancial institutions\
    \ at\nhome and abroad, and smart contract is the most important\nfeature of blockchain\
    \ applications. Therefore, smart con-\ntract can be used to solve fair trading\
    \ or securities problems\nin the ﬁnancial ﬁeld.\nIn the Ethereum platform, aiming\
    \ at the problem that the\ncentralized TTP may leak the contract content, Zhang\
    \ et al.\n[46] proposed a fair contract signing scheme for both\nparties based\
    \ on Ethereum smart contract. In the process of\ncontract signing, automatic smart\
    \ contract is used instead\nof the original TTP agreement, which ensures the fairness\n\
    of signing to a certain extent, however, the signature ver-\niﬁcation process\
    \ cannot be accomplished directly through\nthe smart contract. In order to address\

    \ the\ndisputes between drivers and passengers, Zhang et al. [102]\nproposed a\
    \ secure-charging protocol for service of agent\ndriving based on blockchain smart\
    \ contract, which the\nprotocol eliminates the existence of online third party\n\
    through a publicly veriﬁable smart contract on both sides’\nblockchain, thus ensuring\
    \ the fairness and transparency of\nthe charging process, but this agreement only\
    \ applies to the\n‘‘one-to-one’’ situation. To overcome the problem that the\n\
    charging displayed by the charging system of electric\nvehicles may be different\
    \ from the actual charging power,\nas well as the potential security and privacy\
    \ problems\ncaused by the unreliable and opaque energy market, Sheikh\net al.\
    \ [103] implemented the consensus algorithm of energy\nsecurity exchange to process\
    \ transactions on smart con-\ntracts, but higher handling charges, and the scalability\n\
    needs to be improved. The reason that public fog-node\nlacked the necessary visibility,\
    \ transparency and trust is its\nservices usually use manual payment, Debe et\
    \ al. [104] use\nsmart contracts to realize payment automation, so that fog\n\
    node providers can monitor and measure their services and\nequipment to automatically\
    \ pay bills, but the scalability is\npoor.\nIn Hyperledger Fabric smart contract,\
    \ Hui et al. [105]\nproposed an extended framework of fabric in order to\nensure\
    \ the privacy and invariance of data in transactions\nand realize auditable function,\
    \ which uses smart contract to\nrealize auditable and privacy protection function,\
    \ but the\ncost of its realization is throughput reducing 3–32% and\ndelay increasing\
    \ less than 10%. For the sake of ensuring\nautomation, traceability and controllability\
    \ of contracted\nconstruction project transactions, Faris et al. [106] devel-\n\
    oped a framework for blockchain integrated project deliv-\nery, which uses smart\
    \ contract to achieve automatic\nreimbursement of expenses and implementation\
    \ costs\nsaving. However, there are some problems such as the\nsingle function\
    \ of smart contract, poor practicability of\nframework and trust. In order to\
    \ address the problems of\nhigh maintenance cost, easily tampered data and low\n\
    security in the traditional centralized energy trading sys-\ntem, Zhou et al.\
    \ [107] designed a decentralized energy\ntrading system based on the consortium\
    \ blockchain, which\nuses the collaborative architecture on and off the chain\
    \ and\nsmart contract to realize distributed trading, but lacks\nquantitative\
    \ analysis, and the privacy ability of system still\nneeds to be improved. Mustafa\
    \ et al. [108] proposed a\nconceptual framework of electronic bidding based on\n\
    blockchain smart contract, which uses the characteristics of\nblockchain to ensure\
    \ transparency and fairness in the pro-\ncess of electronic bidding, however,\
    \ there are some prob-\nlems such as lack of the measures of privacy protection\
    \ and\nthe practicability analysis.\nIn the ﬁeld of ﬁnancial transactions, Ethereum\
    \ has more\nobvious advantages in the public blockchain. In the public\nblockchain,\
    \ besides being able to achieve procedural\nsecured transactions and ﬁnancial\
    \ contracts, the synergy\nadvantage enables the contracts in Ethereum to meet\
    \ dif-\nferent functions, which each application built on Ethereum\ncan theoretically\
    \ use the functions provided by other\napplications. Furthermore, Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric is more\nsuitable for dealing with transactions on the consortium\nblockchain.\
    \ Since the release of the formal version, Fabric\nhas been favored by a lot of\
    \ ﬁnancial institutions, which\nmany banks, including state-owned banks, use fabric\
    \ to\nbuild the consortium blockchain and realize business\ninnovation based on\
    \ blockchain. Both platforms have their\nown merits, but the key is to address\
    \ the problems of pri-\nvacy protection and scalability.\n5.3.2 Internet of Things\n\
    At present, the Internet of things (IoT) contains billions of\nnodes sharing data\
    \ through the Internet. Through the\napplication of the integration of Internet\
    \ of things, block-\nchain and smart contract technology, smart contracts can\n\
    be used to to create an economic application with serving\nthe market, decentralized\
    \ and shared, between devices, and\ntake into account the privacy and the value\
    \ of digital assets,\nthus to promote the sharing of services and resources.\n\
    Based on the Ethereum development platform, in order\nto solve the problems of\
    \ untimely processing in the process\nof automobile insurance processing, Lamberti\
    \ et al. [109]\nproposed a system to realize on-demand insurance using\nsmart\
    \ contract and sensor data. Sensors can be used to\ndetect the degree of damage,\
    \ and smart contract can be\nused to automatically trigger compensation, but the\
    \ cus-\ntomer’s privacy takes the risk of being disclosed. Aiming at\nthe problem\
    \ of identity management in the IoT, Omar et al.\n[110] proposed an identity management\
    \ framework for the\nIoT based on semi decentralized blockchain, which uses\n\
    smart contracts to implement the processes and rules of the\ninteraction between\
    \ control devices, but the delay in\ntransaction processing will cause certain\
    \ restrictions of\nmanagement. Many applications in the IoT rely on the\nmachine\
    \ to machine communication, but machine to\nmachine applications faced three challenges\
    \ that is trans-\nparency, lifetime and trust, to meet this challenge, Levis\n\
    et al. [111] studied the possibility and limitations of using\nsmart contracts\
    \ for the machine to machine communication\nby designing, implementing and evaluating\
    \ AGasP, the\nautomatic purchasing gasoline application, which proved\nthat the\
    \ use of smart contracts can improve the trans-\nparency and prolong the lifetime,\
    \ and allow applications to\nminimize the demand for trusted third-parties, nonetheless,\n\
    owing to the transaction throughput of smart contract is\n664\nWireless Networks\
    \ (2022) 28:635–690\n123\nlower, which limits the types of applications that can\
    \ be\nsupported. Kouzinopoulos et al. [112] introduced an\napplication in the\
    \ form of protocol to enhance the trust of\nusers in the IoT environment of GHOST\
    \ project, which\nuses the architecture of front end combining with rear end\n\
    to ensure the data integrity in the distributed decision-\nmaking process by interacting\
    \ with a group of smart con-\ntracts deployed on the private Ethereum network,\
    \ so as to\npromote the trust of users, but the security needs to be\nstrengthened.\n\
    Based on the Hyperledger Fabric development platform,\nJawad et al. [113] proposed\
    \ a blockchain based IoT\narchitecture to address the problem of increased overhead\n\
    and data delay when business continuity is applied to the\nIoT, which introduces\
    \ an execution sequence technology\nfor transactions to separate the execution\
    \ of transactions\nfrom consistency, thus improving efﬁciency, but does not\n\
    consider the issue of privacy and security. For constructing\nan efﬁcient, safe\
    \ and reliable data exchange mechanism\nbetween the independent smart toy data\
    \ platform and other\nIoT systems, Yang et al. [114] used smart contract to solve\n\
    the problem of automatic maintenance of tamper proof,\nreliable and distributed\
    \ ledger under the premise of mutual\ndistrust among participants, but with lower\
    \ scalability. In\norder to provide decentralized authorization for restricted\n\
    IOT devices, Vasilios et al. [115] proposed an application\nmodel based on the\
    \ combination of smart contract and\ninterleaving apparatus mechanism, but it\
    \ has the problems\nof higher execution cost and lower throughput. To address\n\
    the problems of single point of failure and data tampering\nin the methods of\
    \ traditional access control in the IoT\nenvironment, Zhang et al. [116] designed\
    \ Internet of things\naccess control system based on smart contract, which made\n\
    the system more ﬂexible on the basis of address this\nproblem, but the privacy\
    \ of access control strategy still\nneeds to be enhanced.\nThe emergence of blockchain\
    \ smart contract provides a\nchoice for IoT application development needs reliability,\n\
    scalability and persistence to succeed. Therefore, the\napplication of blockchain\
    \ in the IoT has a bright future, and\nthe application of IoT will achieve the\
    \ goal of 20%\ndevelopment\nusing\nblockchain\ntechnology.\nHowever,\nwhether\
    \ the application is implemented on Ethereum or\nHyperledger Fabric platform,\
    \ there will still be some\nscalability issues and privacy security issues in\
    \ addition to\nthe stability of the system, and even the cost of executing\nthe\
    \ smart contract will become a problem to be considered.\nConsequently, it is\
    \ necessary to solve the basic problems of\nlife, security and realization on\
    \ the premise of achieving\nthis goal, to ensure that the ‘‘20% development’’\
    \ is suc-\ncessful, efﬁcient and safe.\n5.3.3 Medical application\nThe development\
    \ of medical technology highly depends on\nthe sharing of medical data such as\
    \ historical cases and\nclinical trials Because medical data inevitably contains\
    \ a\nlarge number of personal privacy data, its access and\nsharing have been\
    \ strictly limited. In addition, it is also\ndifﬁcult for patients to control\
    \ the access rights of their\nown medical data, which leads to the difﬁculty in\
    \ ensuring\ntheir privacy. To remove this hidden danger, medical\nworkers need\
    \ to spend a lot of time and energy to submit\napplications to relevant departments\
    \ for the review of\npermission, and complete data veriﬁcation before data use\n\
    to ensure reliability, which will lead to inefﬁcient work,\nand there are risks\
    \ of medical data tampering, leakage and\nunsafe data transmission.\nIn Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric, it is troublesome to collect due to\nthe dispersity of medical data,\
    \ and also difﬁcult to syn-\nchronize and access these data in real time, to overcome\n\
    this trouble, Zghaibeh et al. [117] put forward a multi-layer\naddressing scheme\
    \ based on a private multi-layer block-\nchain, which to initiate various requests\
    \ by using smart\ncontract, and all users in the system can access the health-\n\
    related data stored in the distributed database, but lack the\nability to verify\
    \ the integrity of the data. For the problem of\ndrug supply security caused by\
    \ the adulteration of coun-\nterfeit drugs into the genuine supply chain, Faisal\
    \ et al.\n[118] used Fabric structure based on blockchain technology\nto process\
    \ the secure drug supply chain records, thus to\nrealize the traceability of drugs,\
    \ but the privacy of patients’\nelectronic health records has the problem of leakage.\n\
    In Ethereum, for the security issues of data transaction\ntransmission and logging\
    \ in IoT devices and other remote\npatient monitoring systems, Griggs et al. [119]\
    \ use the\nsmart contract based on blockchain to promote the security\nanalysis\
    \ and management of medical sensors, which to\nanalyze medical sensors in real\
    \ time and record transaction\nmetadata, but the delay may increase the response\
    \ time,\nthus the system cannot be used for emergency response. In\norder to address\
    \ the security problem of information gen-\nerated by individuals and devices\
    \ in the medical system,\nHoai et al. [120] proposed a telemedicine system based\
    \ on\nblockchain smart contract, which uses smart contract to\nrecord data and\
    \ writes the abnormal data of sensors to the\nblockchain immediately, meanwhile,\
    \ triggers the emer-\ngency contact between doctors and hospitals for timely\n\
    treatment, however, the stability of the system in large-\nscale environment still\
    \ needs to be strengthened. Aiming at\nthe problems such as cumbersome authorization\
    \ process of\nthe medical record, lower record sharing efﬁciency and\ndifﬁcult\
    \ identity veriﬁcation in the current medical system,\nXu et al. [121] proposed\
    \ a scheme that based on the tam-\nper-resistant of blockchain technology and\
    \ combined with\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n665\n123\nasymmetric encryption\
    \ technology, which the advantages\nof smart contract and blockchain distributed\
    \ storage can be\nused to ensure the privacy and security of user’s medical\n\
    information. In the process of dealing with medical insur-\nance, it is often\
    \ pay attention to protecting the user’s pri-\nvacy data but ignore the data security\
    \ problems when\npatients interact with other roles, such as insurance com-\n\
    panies can view the user’s privacy. For this reason, Xu\net al. [122] combined\
    \ homomorphic encryption technology\nwith smart contract, to ensure that any sensitive\
    \ data of\npatients will not be disclosed to unauthorized users in the\ninteraction\
    \ process, so as to strengthen the privacy pro-\ntection of user data, but the\
    \ excessive number of deployed\nsmart contracts will cause the performance to\
    \ degrade, and\nit doesn’t guarantee whether the secure interaction can be\ncarried\
    \ out in malicious mode.\nIn the ﬁeld of medical applications, blockchain smart\n\
    contract is mainly used to address the privacy security of\npatients’ medical\
    \ records and data traceability, which also\nhas the certain application value\
    \ in medical insurance and\ndrug supply chain. However, since the tremendous and\n\
    complex medical data, it must measure between improving\nefﬁciency and reducing\
    \ cost in order to maximize the\nadvantages of blockchain smart contract based\
    \ on solving\nthe problems of privacy and security.\n5.3.4 Supply chain\nAll data\
    \ in the supply chain can be seen in real time\nthrough smart contract. Furthermore,\
    \ taking advantage of\nthe decentralized, tamper proof and traceability of block-\n\
    chain, promotes inventory tracking at the granularity level,\nensures the security\
    \ and reliability of all information in the\nsupply chain, and reduces the risk\
    \ of theft and fraud.\nIn Ethereum, for solving the trouble of product infor-\n\
    mation traceability in cross-border business of manufac-\nturing\nindustry,\n\
    Xu\net\nal.\n[123]\nproposed\na\nsmart\nmanagement scheme of manufacturing supply-chain\
    \ based\non Ethereum blockchain, which uses smart contract to\nrealize process\
    \ management and the cross-chain architec-\nture, and ensuring the compatibility,\
    \ scalability and secu-\nrity of the system, but the throughput is low and the\
    \ system\nperformance needs to be further strengthened. For the\nmedical treatment\
    \ of COVID-19, there are problems such\nas inefﬁcient, single point failure and\
    \ traceability in the\nexisting system for the treatment of forward supply chain\n\
    of COVID-19 medical equipment and the waste generated\nby medical equipment, to\
    \ solve these problems, AHMAD\net al. [124] designed and implemented the COVID-19\n\
    medical equipment supply chain based on Ethereum and\nIPFS (interplanetary ﬁle\
    \ system) and the data traceability\nof waste disposal, as well as to realize\
    \ automatic man-\nagement by using intelligent contracts, however, the\nconﬁdentiality\
    \ of data and the scalability of system require\nbeing promoted. Nirav et al.\
    \ [125] proposed an agricultural\nfood supply chain system (KRanTi) based on blockchain\n\
    and the 5G network, in which uses smart contract to realize\nautomatic credit\
    \ payment system that is used to control the\ndata ﬂow of each role in the supply\
    \ chain and manage order\ntransactions, so as to ensure the traceability of farmers’\n\
    ﬁnancing data and product information, but the overall cost\nis higher.\nIn Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric, for the lack of detection and\nsupervision of counterfeit drugs in the\
    \ drug supply chain,\nand the information asymmetry between investors and drug\n\
    manufacturers in drug research and development, Mueen\n[126] proposed a Fabric\
    \ based drug traceability system\n(Medledger), which uses chaincode to achieve\
    \ the drug\nregistration, automatically deploy the consignment contract\nand update\
    \ drug and contract information, but need to solve\nthe issue of data privacy,\
    \ security and scalability. In order\nto promote information sharing among supply\
    \ chain\ninventory management, Tobias et al. [127] proposed a\ndecentralized information\
    \ sharing model based on Fabric,\nwhich uses chaincode to manage the transaction\
    \ process\nand realize the management of complex multi access\nrights, furthermore,\
    \ it can ensure the implementation of\nprivacy policy in the process of information\
    \ sharing, but it\nis not suitable for large-scale applications owing to the\n\
    performance benchmark is low, and has poor scalability.\nAiming at the matter\
    \ that the information stored in the\nexisting food supply-chain only comes from\
    \ a single\norganization, Gao et al. [128] developed a food supply\nchain traceability\
    \ system (FSCTS) for multi enterprise\ntransaction based on Fabric, which uses\
    \ smart contract to\nmanage the quality information of food, multi enterprise\n\
    food transaction and food data ﬂow, but the performance of\nserver will become\
    \ the bottleneck of system throughput\ngrowth.\nBlockchain smart contract is mainly\
    \ used to solve the\nissues of data transparency, information traceability and\n\
    supervision in the supply chain, which can simplify the\ntransaction process in\
    \ the ﬁelds of practical application\nsuch as IoT, products supply, manufacturing\
    \ and medical\ndrugs. The application of blockchain smart contract in the\nsupply\
    \ chain can improve the transparency and accuracy of\nthe system, which reduces\
    \ cost and improve efﬁciency.\nHowever, it is easy to reduce the performance of\
    \ system\nand the effect of privacy protection as the multi-level\nsupply chain\
    \ and complex multi-management elements.\nBesides, it is much necessary from the\
    \ real-world data\nsources if intend to truly realize the whole process trace-\n\
    ability of goods. Consequently, blockchain smart contract\nneeds to be combined\
    \ with Blockchain Oracle to realize the\npractical application in the supply chain.\n\

    \ yet to mature, EOS technology has been applied\nin different ﬁelds for its advantages\
    \ of no commission and\nhigh performance. Currently, the decentralized application\n\
    of EOS has been implemented in the ﬁelds such as\ne-commerce, education, ﬁnancial\
    \ technology and market,\namong\nwhich\nthe\nrepresentative\napplications\nare\n\
    EOXCommerce, Scatter, EOSﬁnex and Carmel. Besides,\nsome researchers in the EOS\
    \ community also use EOS\ntechnology to solve trading problems.\nBased on the\
    \ eosio platform, due to the high power of\nthe lottery center, the operators\
    \ may collude with some\nplayers, resulting in unfair lottery results, and the\
    \ existing\nwork cannot guarantee that the winning numbers are real\nand random,\
    \ and lottery participants can not verify the\nlottery results. In view of these\
    \ problems, Li et al. [129]\nused smart contracts to record transactions to ensure\
    \ fair-\nness, but it has the problem of lottery buyers’ privacy\nleakage. In\
    \ view of the fact that the logistics industry\ngenerally adopts the centralized\
    \ architecture, which has\nsome security problems, such as low data privacy, low\n\
    degree of decentralization, low traceability and data for-\ngery, Ren [130] designed\
    \ and proposed a smart logistics\nplatform based on blockchain, which uses EOS\
    \ as the\nbottom layer blockchain technology to some sensitive data\nin the logistics\
    \ industry, such as transaction information,\nvehicle information is stored in\
    \ the job chain, to prevent\nsensitive data from being tampered and forged, but\
    \ there\nare problems of high concurrency and low intelligence.\nAiming at the\
    \ problem that EOSIO lacks tools for data\nextraction and exploration, which makes\
    \ the data analysis\nand processing difﬁcult, Zheng et al. [131] proposed\nEOSIO\
    \ data acquisition framework (XBlock EOS), which\nuses smart contract to manage\
    \ internal transactions that not\nonly provides comprehensive EOSIO data sets,\
    \ but also\nupdates on a regular basis and quickly obtains data sets, but\ndoes\
    \ not provide the function of obtaining off-chain data,\nas well as the characteristics\
    \ of EOSIO data need to be\nfurther improved. In view of the matters of large\
    \ scale, high\ncost and single point of failure existing in the security\nframework\
    \ that in existence, Mohsin [132] proposed a\nscalable, ﬂexible and auditable\
    \ RBAC smart contract based\non EOSIO platform by taking advantage of the high\n\
    throughput and the strong capability of data processing of\nEOS blockchain, which\
    \ has the strong points of lightweight\nand low cost, but the privacy of smart\
    \ contract needs to be\nfurther enhanced. To overcome the problem that the\nattacker\
    \ uses the internal vulnerability of EOSIO smart\ncontract to carry out malicious\
    \ attacks, resulting in serious\neconomic losses to users, Huang et al. [133]\
    \ proposed a\ngeneral black-box Fuzzer framework to detect vulnerabil-\nities\
    \ in EOSIO smart contract and report it by testing\nOracle, which has high accuracy\
    \ and scalability, never-\ntheless, it is still necessary to improve the efﬁciency\
    \ of\nvulnerability detection for complex smart contracts.\nIn addition, For the\
    \ privacy security problem caused by\nover reliance on cloud-service providers\
    \ in data sharing\nmanagement platform, Gao et al. [134] proposed a block-\nchain\n\
    based\npersonal\ndata\nsecurity\nsharing\nscheme (BSSPD) by combining EOS, CP-ABE\
    \ and IPFS,\nwhich realized data management and sharing by using\nsmart contract,\
    \ and maximized the decentralization of\nscheme by using EOS and IPFS, however,\
    \ the overhead of\ncomputation is high in large-scale application. In order to\n\
    solve the trouble that sensitive data is easily tampered with\nor leaked by hackers\
    \ or cloud internal managers due to\ncentralized access control mechanism in cloud,\
    \ Yang et al.\n[135] put forward an access control framework for privacy\nprotection\
    \ based on blockchain (AuthPrivacyChain), which\nis based on EOS local test network\
    \ and uses smart contract\nto achieve the settings such as transaction, encryption\
    \ and\naccess control permission, but the efﬁciency and perfor-\nmance of system\
    \ needing to be strengthened. To solve the\nproblem that the existing trading\
    \ platform lacks the\nreporting of threat intelligence information and the incen-\n\
    tive of trading process, Florian et al. [136] proposed a\ncompletely decentralized\
    \ CTI sharing model and a trading\nplatform based on EOS blockchain and IPFS DHT,\
    \ which\nuses smart contract to achieve the incentive mechanism and\nthe reporting\
    \ function, but the performance does not reach\nthe expected effect owing to the\
    \ EOS technology is not\nmature enough, and private security needs to be increased.\n\
    Carreno [137] developed an IoT expert system for smart\ncity construction by using\
    \ smart contract and neural net-\nwork based on EOSIO ecosystem, which the operation\n\
    rules of system are set through smart contract that the data\ninteraction between\
    \ the system and sensors is realized, but\nthere are still some deviations in\
    \ the realization of function.\nAs EOS technology is still in the development\
    \ stage, the\nrelevant research data is less, and the current technology\nhas\
    \ not achieved the expected effect. In addition, there are\ntwo main problems\
    \ in EOS technology as follows:\n1.\nThe ﬁrst problem is the efﬁciency of EOS.\
    \ It was\nclaimed that it could reach the throughput of one\nmillion TPS before\
    \ the launch of EOS, but in fact, EOS\nhas not achieved efﬁciency like that since\
    \ it was\nlaunched. Besides, the DApp game experience on EOS\nis unideal cause\
    \ users can obviously feel the phe-\nnomenon of lag. This means that EOS, on the\
    \ one\nhand, has certain centralization, on the other hand, it\ndoes not improve\
    \ ETH’s experience. In this way,\npeople’s expectations of EOS have plummeted.\n\
    2.\nThe other problem is centralization of EOS gover-\nnance. The initial governance\
    \ mechanism of EOS is as\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n667\n123\nfollows:\
    \ ﬁrstly, the EOS convention was adopted by\nreferendum; secondly, the EOS master\
    \ node is selected\nby the whole people with one coin and one ballot;\nlastly,\
    \ the EOS transaction is voted by the master node,\nwhich more than 2/3 can pass.\
    \ Therefore, it is very\nunlikely that the master node will attack the EOS node\n\
    with the attacker in accounting. However, the reason\nthat it forms a centralized\
    \ governance mechanism is\nbecause the EOS master node has common interests in\n\
    transaction. In other words, whether the EOS main\nnetwork can be started or not,\
    \ and what kind of code\nthe EOS runs, are jointly determined by 21 main nodes.\n\
    Consequently, if the main node does not implement the\nprocedure in the case of\
    \ universal approval, the\nreferendum will be meaningless. Thus it can be seen\n\
    that EOS transactions rely more on the decision of 21\nmaster nodes, which is\
    \ a weakness of DPOS consensus.\n5.3.6 Blockchain Oracle\nBlockchain Oracle is\
    \ a rigid demand for blockchain prac-\ntical applications. At present, many companies\
    \ in the\nblockchain industry have built Blockchain Oracle with\ntheir own advantages.\
    \ Aiming at the problems in traditional\ncentralized cloud alliance such as quality\
    \ monitoring, blind\ntrust of SLA and quality of service monitoring, Mona et al.\n\
    [138] proposed a decentralized cloud alliance model based\non blockchain. Cloud\
    \ requesters, providers and Oracle\ninteract on and off the chain through smart\
    \ contracts, in\nwhich Oracle acts as the agent of veriﬁcation to monitor the\n\
    quality of service, and report to the smart contract agent\ndeployed on the blockchain,\
    \ but the cost has not yet been\nestimated, as well as the authenticity between\
    \ Oracle still\nneeds to be enhanced. For the privacy problem caused by\nthe scene\
    \ of crowd-perception of traditional vehicle, Zhang\net al. [139] proposed a vehicle\
    \ crowd-perception data\naggregation and privacy protection scheme (PRVB) based\n\
    on Blockchain Oracle, in which the data of vehicle per-\nception is obtained through\
    \ Oracle and sent to the block-\nchain, furthermore, and the privacy protection\
    \ of data\naggregation on the chain is realized by smart contract, but\nthe reliability\
    \ of data needs to be improved.\nApart from the application research of the decentralized\n\
    platform, researchers also optimize and expand Oracle\nitself. In view of the\
    \ single point of failure caused by the\ncentralization of a single Oracle server\
    \ in the application of\nIoT based on blockchain, Sangyeon et al. [140] proposed\
    \ a\ndistributed Oracle (DiOr-SGX) based on Intel SGX for\nEthereum, in which\
    \ the smart contract can obtain the off-\nchain data through Oracle, and Oracle\
    \ obtains data from\nexternal data sources through TLS communication and\nsends\
    \ the external data to the blockchain through the\nreputation system, but it needs\
    \ to reduce the number of\ntimes that malicious nodes are selected as Leader Oracle.\n\
    For the sake of further develop the practical application of\nblockchain, Keerthi\
    \ et al. [141] proposed a new decen-\ntralized Oracle protocol based on crowdsourcing\
    \ the voting\nmechanism, and on Ethereum and Web3 clients, Oracle\nsmart contract\
    \ is used to implement management that\nmember, contract and Reward/ Penalty mechanism,\
    \ while\non-chain smart contract is responsible for interacting with\nexternal\
    \ data sources through Oracle protocols, but the\nperformance of Oracle needs\
    \ to be improved.\nIn the future, Blockchain Oracle will become the core\ntechnology\
    \ of Blockchain 3.0 and promote the develop-\nment of the next generation of smart\
    \ contracts. And\nBlockchain\nOracle\nwill\nbecome\nindispensable\nwhen\nblockchain\
    \ applications become mainstream. By using\nBlockchain Oracle, smart contract\
    \ can access more com-\nprehensive data sources, and then expand the application\n\
    scope of it. In other words, the emergence of Oracle\naccelerates the implementation\
    \ of mainstream applications\nbased on blockchain smart contract technology.\n\
    5.3.7 Other applications of blockchain smart contract\nIn terms of privacy protection,\
    \ in order to solve the prob-\nlem of privacy protection in the alliance blockchain\
    \ plat-\nform, Cai Liang et al. [142] took data isolation as the main\nidea and\
    \ divided privacy protection into inter chain and\nintra chain. Smart contract\
    \ is mainly used in intra chain\nprivacy protection, exists in the form of privacy\
    \ ledger, and\nprotects data privacy through the combination of hash\nencryption\
    \ and double signature technology. However, it is\nonly suitable for privacy protection\
    \ of small amount of\ndata, and its performance is poor. There is a ubiquitous\n\
    phenomenon of data centralized storage in the existing\narchives data management,\
    \ as well as some problems such\nas poor security and tamper resistance. For these\
    \ problems,\nTan et al. [143] realized the identity authentication of\ndigital\
    \ archives and the determination of archives owner-\nship through the combination\
    \ of smart contract and digital\nsignature technology, and combined smart contract\
    \ with\nInterplanetary File System (IPFS) and other technologies to\nachieve the\
    \ goal that the protection, veriﬁcation, recovery\nand sharing of digital archives.\
    \ However, there are some\ndeﬁciencies that the larger the block height interval\
    \ of\npublic blockchain contract storage, the lower the degree of\nprotection\
    \ and data recovery of consortium blockchain. In\nthe traditional transaction\
    \ process, there is a lack of fair-\nness during arbitration for the subjectivity\
    \ of the middle-\nman, moreover, has privacy security issues, to overcome\nthese\
    \ problems, Li et al. [144] proposed a fair scheme for\nbig-data exchange based\
    \ on smart contract and oblivious\ntransfer protocol, among which smart contract\
    \ is used to\n668\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\nrealize fair, autonomous\
    \ and timing control of transaction,\nbut it is a difﬁcult problem to select appropriate\
    \ n and m in\nm–n oblivious transmission.\nBlockchain smart contract can also\
    \ be used to address\nthe problems of access control and the incentive mecha-\n\
    nism. To effectively implement cross organization RBAC\n(Role-based Access Control)\
    \ mechanism in the computer\nnetwork, Cruz et al. [145] proposed a role-based\
    \ smart\ncontract access control mechanism (RBAC-SC), which\npublishes all relevant\
    \ information of user role assignment\nin the smart contract deployed on the blockchain,\
    \ and uses\nthe Challenge-Response authentication protocol to verify\nwhether\
    \ the user has relevant roles, but privacy protection\nstill needs to be enhanced,\
    \ and has higher operation cost.\nAiming at the dynamic incentive mechanism of\
    \ data\nsharing for a large number of users in the process of data\nsharing, Xuan\
    \ et al. [146] put forward an incentive model\nfor data sharing based on evolutionary\
    \ game theory, which\ndeployed it on the smart contract to maintain the level\
    \ of\nuser participation by dynamically adjusting the incentive\nand participation\
    \ cost, but ignored the inﬂuence of the size\nand quality of data that is shared\
    \ by users.\n6 Application of smart contract in industrial\ninternet\nAs an important\
    \ cornerstone of the fourth industrial revo-\nlution, Industrial Internet is the\
    \ key to the deep integration\nof the new generation of information and communication\n\
    technology and industrial economy, and provides a way to\nimplement for the construction\
    \ and development of the\nwhole industrial chain and the whole value chain [147].\
    \ In\nrecent years, driven by new theories and technologies such\nas mobile Internet,\
    \ big data, cloud computing, artiﬁcial\nintelligence and blockchain, the industrial\
    \ Internet has\ngradually shown new characteristics such as deep learning,\ncross-border\n\
    integration,\nman–machine\ncollaboration,\nopening crowdsensing and independent\
    \ control, which is\nmaking a great impact on economic development, social\nprogress,\
    \ international politics. Moreover, it also has had a\nsigniﬁcant and far-reaching\
    \ impact on the economic pattern\nand lifestyle [148–150]. Currently, the Industrial\
    \ Internet\nmainly takes the centralized network architecture as the\ninfrastructure,\
    \ and there are problems such as SPOF (single\npoint of failure), high latency,\
    \ low performance and pri-\nvacy security threats [151], which further hinders\
    \ the\ntransformation of industrial digitization, networking and\nintelligence.\
    \ The advantages of Industrial Internet are\nsteadily increasing, but it still\
    \ faces the challenges shown\nin Fig. 17.\nThe emergence of cloud computing and\
    \ blockchain\ntechnology provides a new solution to realize the high-\nlevel,\
    \ all-round and in-depth integration of information\ntechnology and industrial\
    \ system, and form a new indus-\ntrial ecology with comprehensive data, intelligent\
    \ appli-\ncation and high reliability [152–155]. Industrial Internet\nmainly focuses\
    \ on industrial cloud, and cloud technology\ncan meet key technical challenges\
    \ and data management\nchallenges. Nevertheless, whether it is on the cloud of\n\
    equipment, the production process or operation, it puts\nforward high requirements\
    \ for the security environment.\nTherefore, the key to the construction of Industrial\
    \ Internet\nis security. Only by ensuring security can we better solve\nthe problems\
    \ of delay and efﬁciency. However, the intro-\nduction of blockchain technology\
    \ will help to solve the\nsecurity problems of applications. The ternary nature\
    \ of\nblockchain technology (scalability, distribution and secu-\nrity) can solve\
    \ the problems of transparency, traceability\nand security. The integration of\
    \ blockchain technology and\nIndustrial Internet is also a worthwhile research\
    \ direction\n[155].\nSafety Problems\n•\nLack of industrial data security responsibility\

    Wireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n669\n123\nThis Section will introduce the\
    \ application potential of\nblockchain smart contract in the ﬁelds of manufacturing\n\
    industry, food industry and IIoT (industrial Internet of\nthings), and further\
    \ explore the applied value of smart\ncontract in Industry 4.0.\n6.1 Manufacturing\
    \ industry\nAfter the realization of electronic and IT systems for pro-\nduction\
    \ automation, with the emergence of CPS (cyber-\nphysical systems) [156], the\
    \ pattern of global manufac-\nturing will also face new opportunities and challenges.\n\
    Intelligent manufacturing based on the deep integration of\nnew generation information\
    \ and communication technol-\nogy and advanced manufacturing technology, is a\
    \ new\nproduction mode with the functions of self-perception, self-\nlearning,\
    \ self-decision-making, self-implementation and\nself-adaptation, which runs through\
    \ all links of manufac-\nturing activities such as design, production, management\n\
    and service [157–159]. Intelligent manufacturing has\nbecome the strategic commanding\
    \ point of manufacturing\ndevelopment, and will become the inevitable trend of\n\
    manufacturing\ndevelopment\nin\nthe\nfuture.\nHowever,\nalthough the traditional\
    \ manufacturing industry is facing\nprofound changes, it is not easy to promote\
    \ intelligent\nmanufacturing, and there are still many problems to be\nsolved.\
    \ Clarifying the direction of digital transformation,\ncracking the island effect,\
    \ releasing data values, and pro-\nmoting upstream and downstream cooperation\
    \ and inno-\nvation in the industrial chain are the key problems that\nmanufacturing\
    \ enterprises need to solve for promoting\ndigital\ntransformation\nand\nintelligent\n\
    manufacturing\n[157, 160, 161]. Blockchain technology, with its charac-\nteristics\
    \ of development, autonomy, reliability and security,\ncontinues to promote the\
    \ transformation from Information\nInternet to Value Internet. If intelligent\
    \ manufacturing is to\nintegrate with a wide range of social production networks\n\
    and achieve the transfer of value, it is inseparable from the\ncombination of\
    \ blockchain technology [162]. The integra-\ntion of blockchain technology and\
    \ intelligent manufactur-\ning brings reconstruction and innovation to the traditional\n\
    manufacturing industry and realizes the digitization and\nnetworking of manufacturing.\n\
    Intelligent manufacturing mainly realizes the vertical\nintegration of internal\
    \ information systems of manufac-\nturing enterprises, and the horizontal integration\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturing enterprises based on the value\nchain and information\
    \ ﬂow [163]. However, multi-source\nheterogeneous data and centralized architecture\
    \ control\nmakes it more difﬁcult to obtain information in real time in\npractical\
    \ applications. In addition, all kinds of information\nare stored in independent\
    \ systems, and there are certain\ndifferences\nin\ntechnical\narchitecture,\n\
    communication\nprotocols and data storage format of each system, which\nwill seriously\
    \ affect the efﬁciency of interconnection and\nrestrict the application of intelligent\
    \ manufacturing in the\nactual production process [164]. Sensors, control modules\n\
    and systems, communication networks and ERP (enterprise\nresource planning) systems\
    \ in the manufacturing industry\ncan be connected by using the characteristics\
    \ of blockchain\ntechnology, and through the infrastructure of uniﬁed led-\nger,\
    \ enterprises, equipment manufacturers and work safety\nsupervision departments\
    \ can monitor all links of produc-\ntion and manufacturing for a long time and\
    \ continuously,\nso as to improve the safety and reliability of production and\n\
    manufacturing. At the same time, the traceability and\ntamper proof of distributed\
    \ ledger records for blockchain\nare also conducive to the development of enterprise\
    \ audit,\nwhich is easy to ﬁnd problems, track problems, solve\nproblems, optimize\
    \ the system, and greatly improve the\nlevel of intelligent management for production\
    \ and man-\nufacturing process. Applying blockchain technology to\nmanufacturing\n\
    industry\nmainly\nhas\nthe\nfollowing\nadvantages:\n1.\nBlockchain technology\
    \ can effectively collect and\nanalyze all software and hardware equipment informa-\n\
    tion existing in the independent system, further solve\nthe problem of data island,\
    \ and help the enterprise\neffectively establish a safer operation mechanism,\n\
    more efﬁcient workﬂow, and better service.\n2.\nData transparency and traceability\
    \ with blockchain\nmakes R & D audit, manufacturing and circulation\nmore effective.\
    \ At the same time, it also reduces\noperating costs, improves yield, and reduces\
    \ manufac-\nturing costs for manufacturing enterprises, so that\nenterprises have\
    \ higher competitive edge.\n3.\nIt helps to improve the transparency and ﬂexibility\
    \ of\nthe value chain, and can more quickly deal with the\nproblems existing on\
    \ production, logistics, warehous-\ning, marketing, after-sales and other links.\n\
    Furthermore, the main functions of smart contract for\nintelligent manufacturing\
    \ are shown in Fig. 18.\nThe integration of blockchain smart contract technology\n\
    and intelligent manufacturing will effectively solve the\ntroubles of the current\
    \ manufacturing industry and further\nreshape the value chain. There are three\
    \ main application\nscenarios after the integration of the two:\n6.1.1 Assist\
    \ in building intelligent manufacturing\necosystem\nThe implementation of intelligent\
    \ manufacturing is a\ncomplex project promoted step by step, involving the\nwhole\
    \ life cycle of products such as design, production,\nlogistics, sales and service,\
    \ as well as the implementation\n670\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\n\
    of enterprise system architecture such as equipment-layer,\ncontrol-layer, management-layer,\
    \ enterprise-layer, cloud\nservice-layer and network-layer, which needs to realize\n\
    horizontal, vertical and end-to-end integration [160, 165].\nBlockchain smart\
    \ contract technology can assist in the\nintegration of artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ 5G technology [166],\nedge computing [167] and other information technologies\n\
    with the manufacturing industry, which is embodied in\nthree aspects:\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology uses P2P networking technol-\nogy and hybrid communication protocol\
    \ to handle the\ncommunication between heterogeneous devices, which\nwill signiﬁcantly\
    \ reduce the construction and mainte-\nnance cost of centralized data center.\
    \ Furthermore, it\ncan disperse the computing and storage requirements to\neach\
    \ device constituting the IoT network, and effec-\ntively prevent the any SPOF\

    \ tamper proof feature of the distributed ledger with\nblockchain can effectively\
    \ prevent the risk of informa-\ntion disclosure and malicious manipulation after\
    \ any\nsingle node device in the IIoT is maliciously attacked\nand controlled.\n\
    •\nThe combination of blockchain smart contract technol-\nogy and real-time simulation\
    \ technology based on\ndigital twins is able to timely and dynamically grasp the\n\
    status of various production and manufacturing equip-\nment in the network, improve\
    \ equipment utilization and\nthe maintenance efﬁciency, provide accurate and efﬁ-\n\
    cient ﬁnancial services of supply chain. Moreover, it\ncan also help other information\
    \ technologies better\ncarry out man–machine collaboration and data process-\n\
    ing, which jointly builds a good intelligent manufac-\nturing system ecosystem.\n\
    6.1.2 Data security and the distributed network\nof intelligent production\nBlockchain\n\
    technology\ncan\nprovide\nenterprises\nwith\nencryption services of different\
    \ security levels, conduct\nnon intermediary transmission of important data onto\
    \ the\nmanufacturing supply chain, and ensure the encryption\nsecurity of important\
    \ production data. With the integrated\napplication of blockchain technology and\
    \ intelligent man-\nufacturing, the distributed network of intelligent production\n\
    will be formed to promote the service-oriented transfor-\nmation of the manufacturing\
    \ industry dominated by the\nneeds of end customers [168]. In addition, it can\
    \ improve\nthe efﬁciency of enterprise through integrated and intelli-\ngent production,\
    \ and reduce the production cost of enter-\nprises through standardized and networked\
    \ production.\n6.1.3 Intelligent management of manufacturing supply\nchain\nBlockchain\
    \ technology can effectively break through the\ndata island of each link to the\
    \ manufacturing supply chain,\nrealize information sharing after data is connected\
    \ to the\nchain, and realize intelligent decision-making based on big\ndata analysis.\
    \ Furthermore, the traceability of blockchain is\nconducive to tracing fake and\
    \ shoddy products and\nrecalling problematic products [169]. And smart contract\n\
    technology can optimize the operational efﬁciency of\nmanufacturing business,\
    \ reduce transaction costs and avoid\ntransaction risks. In addition, smart contracts\
    \ can also\nrealize the innovative application of enterprises audits, so\nthat\
    \ enterprises can not only reduce the cost of reviewing\ntheir own data and processes,\
    \ but also share data with\nauditors. Due to the ﬁnancial attribute of blockchain,\
    \ it can\nhelp to manufacture enterprises to further intelligentize\nRealize the\

    \ of global value chain.\nThe integration of intelligent manufacturing and block-\n\
    chain technology is still in its infancy, but many industrial\ninstitutions have\
    \ begun to pay attention to and participate\nin its application exploration [171].\
    \ In the future, the new\necology of effective integration of blockchain and intelli-\n\
    gent manufacturing will bring creative changes to the\nworld’s information technology\
    \ and industrial develop-\nment. The ecological platform with blockchain as the\n\
    underlying technology, information oriented and demand\ndata directly driving\
    \ the manufacturing terminal will\nreconstruct the traditional manufacturing industry.\
    \ And\nproducts will be greatly improved on a globalized and open\necological\
    \ environment, so as to liberate productivity to the\ngreatest extent and lead\
    \ the global manufacturing industry\nto create revolutionary and brand-new production\
    \ relations.\n6.2 Food industry\nWith the rapid development of the global food\
    \ industry, the\nfood industry has gradually evolved into today’s trend\ntowards\
    \ intelligence from the initial mechanization to\nautomation. However, due to\
    \ the acceleration of the ver-\ntical extension and horizontal expansion of the\
    \ food\nindustry chain, the food industry system has gradually\nimproved, and\
    \ the integrated whole industry chain opera-\ntion of production, purchase, storage,\
    \ processing and\nmarketing has become a more popular business model\n[172]. Nevertheless,\
    \ for the complex production lines in the\nfood industry, the resulting food quality\
    \ and safety cannot\nbe ignored. The food industry Internet can be roughly\ndivided\
    \ into three parts: agricultural production supply\nchain, food processing chain\
    \ and product sales chain, as\nshown in Fig. 19.\n6.2.1 Agricultural production\
    \ supply chain\nThis part is mainly composed of raw material suppliers and\npurchasers,\
    \ involving the production process of planting,\nﬁshing and animal husbandry.\
    \ In the operation process of\nthe supply chain, suppliers mainly produce raw\
    \ materials\nfor agricultural products, record the speciﬁc production\ndata onto\
    \ raw materials and package them. After reaching a\ntransaction consensus with\
    \ the purchaser, raw materials are\ntransported through the food logistics service\
    \ industry until\nthe purchaser conﬁrms the receipt then completes the\ntransaction.\
    \ The intellectualization of agricultural produc-\ntion supply chain is mainly\
    \ divided into two aspects: the\nintellectualization of production process and\
    \ the intellec-\ntualization of raw material supply.\nThe intellectualization\
    \ of production process refers to\nthe use of emerging IT technology and IoT equipment\
    \ to\nguide the prediction and implementation of production\nprocess, mainly focusing\
    \ on agricultural expert system\n[173, 174]. There are three main indicators of\
    \ the intel-\nlectualization of production process: the intellectualization\n\
    of\nproduction\nequipment,\nthe\nintellectualization\nof\nModern Food Industry\
    \ System\nAgricultural Production \nSupply Chain\nFood Processing \nChain\nProduct\

    production process optimization and management, and the\nintellectualization of\
    \ production prediction and quality\nclassiﬁcation identiﬁcation. Among them,\
    \ the intellectual-\nization of production equipment is the key to the devel-\n\
    opment of the food industry and the only way to change\nfrom automation to intelligence\
    \ [175]. In addition, by\nadding sensors to production equipment and using edge\n\
    computing and other technologies, remote control and\nautomatic operation can\
    \ be realized. The automatic exe-\ncution characteristics of blockchain smart\
    \ contract help to\nimprove the control efﬁciency, alleviate the load of agri-\n\
    cultural producers, and reduce labor demand. Besides,\nspeciﬁc production environment\
    \ data and raw material\ngrowth status data can be obtained through the detection\n\
    device, and use blockchain to save the data can assist the\nexpert system in data\
    \ analysis and decision-making, which\neffectively improves the production quality\
    \ and production\nefﬁciency, achieve accurate operation, and reduce pro-\nduction\
    \ cost and resource waste. Production environment is\na key factor affecting the\
    \ growth quality and yield of crops\nand livestock crops [176, 177]. Therefore,\
    \ by analyzing all\nlinks in the production process and using technologies such\n\
    as artiﬁcial intelligence, big data, blockchain and machine\nlearning, it can\
    \ realize accurate production decision-mak-\ning, solve the problems of natural\
    \ disaster, disease pre-\nvention and cost-effectiveness in the production process,\n\
    and reduce production risks. The feedback information\nabout different links can\
    \ be obtained in real time through\nthe blockchain smart contract, which can further\
    \ optimize\nthe management process of agricultural production and\nprovide a basis\
    \ of maximizing the beneﬁts of agricultural\nproduction.\nHowever, there are still\
    \ complex risks of the intellec-\ntualization of agricultural production supply\
    \ chain: poor\ntraceability owing to uncontrollable factors such as cli-\nmate;\
    \ the complex production line leads to low transaction\nefﬁciency; the existence\
    \ of a large number of intermedi-\naries in supply chain transactions leads to\
    \ information\nasymmetry and data opacity; continuous suppliers are often\nlarge-scale\
    \ producers with good reputation, while weak\nsuppliers have a single channel,\
    \ which is not conducive to\neconomic development [178]. The decentralization\
    \ of\nblockchain technology can remove intermediaries in the\nagricultural value\
    \ chain, reduce transaction risks and\nimprove efﬁciency. Blockchain smart contract\
    \ can reduce\nuncertainty, improve interoperability and product trace-\nability,\
    \ promote the trust building among market players,\nand provide more inclusive\
    \ opportunities of market par-\nticipation for vulnerable suppliers [179]. The\
    \ main appli-\ncation advantages of blockchain smart contract technology\nin agricultural\
    \ production supply chain are as follows:\n1.\nProvide distributed database to\
    \ track products, digital\nassets and transactions, integrate each process and\n\
    transaction in the supply chain in real time, and\nimprove the transaction efﬁciency.\n\
    2.\nProvide product traceability to ensure the authenticity\nof products. It can\
    \ store transparent and tamper proof\ndata, and has the potential to create efﬁciency\
    \ gains for\neach participant.\n3.\nReduce the difﬁculty of monitoring and control,\
    \ and\nreduce the frequency of fraud and misplaced transac-\ntions [178].\n4.\n\
    Remove intermediaries, and achieve direct interaction\nbetween\nsuppliers\nand\n\
    acquirers\nthrough\ndata\nintegration.\n5.\nThe integration of blockchain technology\
    \ and intelli-\ngent devices can provide high product quality, data\nsecurity\
    \ and sustainable development.\n6.\nCombine with artiﬁcial intelligence and other\
    \ tech-\nnologies to further improve automation and intelli-\ngence of the control\
    \ system.\n7.\nImplementing the GS1 (globe standard 1) standard in\nblockchain\
    \ can meet the new regulations of the\ngovernment and the business traceability\
    \ requirements\nof industry regulators, and facilitate the veriﬁcation of\nproducts\
    \ [180].\n6.2.2 Food processing chain\nThe food processing chain is mainly responsible\
    \ for deal-\ning with raw materials, processing and packaging them into\nproducts,\
    \ and then transporting them to major sales points\nthrough the food logistics\
    \ service industry. However, there\nare still two major problems with the food\
    \ processing\nindustry: one is the processing cost is high and consumes a\nlot\
    \ of resources and energy, resulting in low resource uti-\nlization; but the most\
    \ important problem is food safety\nissue. The distributed ledger, transparency,\
    \ traceability and\nother characteristics of blockchain technology had great\n\
    potential in solving food safety and resource management.\nIn terms of resource\
    \ management, it can promote\ncoordination and interaction among enterprises by\
    \ clarify-\ning the data format and interaction requirements of the\nresource\n\
    information\nchain\n[181].\nAnalyze\nthe\nbest\nresource utilization decision\
    \ through data sharing and data\nintegration, which promotes the digitization\
    \ of resource\nutilization and reduce the resource waste rate. In addition,\n\
    due to the decentralization of blockchain, business expen-\nses can be further\
    \ saved. The multi chain architecture, cross\nchain technology and slicing technology\
    \ of blockchain can\noptimize the resource allocation scheme, and automatically\n\
    execute the process through smart contract to make the\nprocessing process more\
    \ intelligent.\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n673\n123\nIn terms of food\
    \ safety, food safety incidents have\noccurred frequently all over the world in\
    \ recent years. How\nto ensure food traceability and tracking has become an\n\
    urgent problem to be solved. The information storage of\nthe traditional food\
    \ traceability system often uses a single\ndatabase for centralized storage, which\
    \ leads to the coun-\nterfeiter can tamper with the database. The existence of\n\
    false data makes it difﬁcult for the government to quickly\ncheck the source of\
    \ food in case of health emergencies. The\nasymmetry of traceability information\
    \ leads to low trace-\nability efﬁciency, and the identiﬁcation of false data\
    \ has\nalso become a major difﬁculty [182]. The opacity of food\nprocessing leads\
    \ to consumers’ inability to understand the\nsource of food, which increases consumers’\
    \ safety risks.\nThe quality supervision and testing of the food industry had\n\
    become the main force to control the food safety problems.\nThe emergence of blockchain\
    \ technology is expected to\nsolve the weak points of the traditional food traceability\n\
    system [183–185], and reﬂect the applied value of block-\nchain in reshaping a\
    \ new information circulation and\ntamper proof traceability system.\nBlockchain\
    \ has two advantages for food safety trace-\nability. The ﬁrst is the whole process\
    \ sharing of informa-\ntion, and the second is the easy traceability. Speciﬁc\n\
    application advantages are as follows:\n1.\nBy adding raw material suppliers,\
    \ processing enter-\nprises, sales enterprises, equipment manufacturing\nenterprises\
    \ and logistics service enterprises to block-\nchain, and taking advantage of\
    \ the characteristics of\nblockchain, such as the tamper proof, data consistency\n\
    and traceability, it can effectively build a consortium\nblockchain of government\
    \ regulators, enterprise enti-\nties and third-party regulators, so as to realize\
    \ the\nwhole process sharing for all kinds of food related\nproduct information,\
    \ and solve the problem of multi\nparticipant trust in the food traceability system.\n\
    2.\nThe blockchain system can save the tamper proof\nrecords of the data processing\
    \ process, and the\nauthenticity of the data is guaranteed. Using the IoT,\nblockchain\
    \ smart contract and encryption technology,\nthe traceability information from\
    \ food production to\nsales is presented to consumers. Anyone can easily\ntrace\
    \ the food information in his hand on the chain,\nwhich easily solves the problem\
    \ of consumer trust.\n3.\nUsing the blockchain system to process the testing\n\
    process of food testing institutions can make the testing\nresults open and transparent,\
    \ and further promote the\nsupervision of bad behaviors in food testing.\nFood\
    \ safety is not only related to personal health, but also\nrelated to the stability\
    \ of the whole society [186]. Although\nwe may never be able to completely remove\
    \ food-borne\nsafety issues [187], blockchain technology will certainly\nbring\n\
    us\ncost-effective\ntransparency,\nand\nimprove\naccountability to a new level.\n\
    6.2.3 Product sales chain\nThe product sales chain is mainly responsible for the\n\
    business activities of processed products. In the era of the\ndigital economy,\
    \ sales business is increasingly transferred\nto the digital market. How to create\
    \ the trust and data\nsecurity of business partners and consumers, reduce oper-\n\
    ating costs and greatly improve the transaction efﬁciency\nhas become the key\
    \ to enterprise competition [188–190].\nBlockchain has become a key factor of\
    \ enterprise compe-\ntition and can empower the innovation and development of\n\
    enterprises. How to give full play to the great potential for\nblockchain in solving\
    \ problems such as enterprise trusts,\nefﬁciency, cost controls, risk management\
    \ and data secu-\nrity has become a research hotspot of digital commercial\ntrade.\
    \ The application advantages of blockchain smart\ncontract technology in product\
    \ sales chain are as follows:\n1.\nBlockchain technology provides high security\
    \ on\nbusiness processes that store and transmit data. It can\nnot only process\
    \ digital asset transactions in real time,\nbut also ensure security and accuracy.\n\
    2.\nThe monetary characteristics can realize the digitiza-\ntion of assets, use\
    \ smart contract to save the attributes\nand use standards of each asset, track\
    \ the ownership\nand transfer of assets, and help the digital intelligence\neconomy\
    \ realize the value of token [191, 192].\n3.\nDecentralization creates great transparency\
    \ for every\ntransaction in the sales chain, and each transaction can\nbe quickly\
    \ and conveniently added to the blockchain at\nmarginal cost. At the same time,\
    \ it reduces the\ntransaction risk of sales.\n4.\nThe integration of blockchain\
    \ and IoT can ensure the\ncredibility, security and integrity of ofﬂine real logis-\n\
    tics to data collection and transmission, optimize the\nﬁlling efﬁciency and reduce\
    \ the risk of cheating.\n5.\nImprove the current situation of extensive management\n\
    of commodity circulation process and shorten the cycle\nof commodity circulation.\n\
    6.\nP2P technology enables the information ﬂow between\nsellers, accurately master\
    \ the loss or damage of goods,\nand reduce the loss rate of goods.\n7.\nThe use\
    \ of traceability can provide vouchers for traded\ngoods, avoid deceptive transactions,\
    \ and help to\nestablish trust between sellers and consumers.\nThe digital asset\
    \ trading system based on blockchain\ntechnology is still in the continuous improvement\
    \ stage. In\nthe future, blockchain can carry out research from eight\naspects:\
    \ basic theoretical innovation, core technology\nbreakthrough,\nestablishment\n\
    of\nthe\nstandard\nsystem,\n674\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\npromotion\

    \ on talent training, intro-\nduction of policy guarantee and jointly construction\
    \ of\ngood ecology, so as to help the high-quality development\nof digital and\
    \ intelligent economy.\n6.3 Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0\nIndustrial\
    \ Internet refers to networks that enable industrial\ninterconnection, including\
    \ not only the upgrading of\nindustry, but also the upgrading of the Internet\
    \ [150]. After\nthe deep integration of industry and the Internet, a new\nindustrial\
    \ ecology using Internet thinking and information\ntechnology will be formed [193].\
    \ This ecology focuses on\ndemand leading, innovation driven and manufacturing\n\
    upgrading. Industry 4.0 refers to the fourth industrial rev-\nolution dominated\
    \ by intelligent manufacturing, which\naims at transforming the manufacturing\
    \ industry to intel-\nligence by making full use of the combination of infor-\n\
    mation communication technology and cyberspace virtual\nsystem (such as CPS) [194].\
    \ It should be noted that\nIndustry 4.0 emphasizes methodology, which indicates\
    \ the\nstage of industrial development and points out that the\ndevelopment trend\
    \ of manufacturing industry is intelli-\ngence [195]. The Industrial Internet\
    \ covers the IIoT, which\nis the speciﬁc implementation of industry 4.0 [193].\
    \ If it\nwants to realize intelligent manufacturing and achieve the\npersonalization\
    \ and customization of industrial production,\nit must rely on the IIoT. As a\
    \ new technology, under the\nbackground of Industry 4.0, how to use blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology to give full play to its potential application potential\nand\
    \ solve the key challenges in intelligent manufacturing\nand system security had\
    \ become the key research direction\nof various industrial departments [196].\n\
    This Section will introduce the applied potential for\nblockchain in IIoT, and\
    \ further analyze the guiding sig-\nniﬁcance of blockchain in Industry 4.0.\n\
    6.3.1 Industrial Internet of Things\nThe speciﬁc deﬁnition of IIoT is that machines,\
    \ computers\nand personnel use the advanced data analysis results\nobtained by\
    \ business transformation to achieve intelligent\nindustrial operation. By applying\
    \ perception technology,\ncommunication technology, transmission technology, data\n\
    processing technology and control technology to the\nindustrial production process,\
    \ comprehensively collect the\nbasic data of bottom and conduct deeper data analysis\
    \ and\nmining, so as to build a new service driven industrial\necosystem [197].\
    \ The IIoT has six characteristics: intelli-\ngent perception, ubiquitous connectivity,\
    \ accurate control,\ndigital modeling, real-time analysis and iterative opti-\n\
    mization [198]. What’s more, the use of IIoT can achieve\nintelligent equipment,\
    \ intelligent system and intelligent\ndecision-making. However, the operation\
    \ of the IIoT still\ndepends on the centralized architecture, which will lead\
    \ to\nproblems with security and system performance. The IIoT\nstill faces the\
    \ following challenges [151, 199–201]:\n1.\nThe disadvantages caused by centralized\
    \ architecture\n(such as SPOF), and the huge number of equipment\nlead to poor\
    \ robustness of the system.\n2.\nPoor visibility of equipment and endpoints, and\
    \ the\ndifﬁculty of segmentation of networking environment.\n3.\nPoor traceability\
    \ of information, and inefﬁcient data\nsecurity strategy.\n4.\nReal-time requirements,\
    \ and the problem of edge\ntraining and cloud edge cooperation [202].\n5.\nThe\n\
    equipment\nresource\nis\nconstrained,\nand\nthe\nconnection\nbetween\nequipment\n\
    is\nunstable\nand\nunpredictable.\n6.\nPrivacy and interoperability between heterogeneous\n\
    devices, as well as deception and false authentication\nin data sharing.\n7.\n\
    The difﬁculty of peer-to-peer interaction caused by\npersonalized service requirements\
    \ and the standardiza-\ntion of complex protocols.\n8.\nInformation security in\
    \ cross system interaction, and\nthe problem of security and efﬁciency for the\
    \ control\nsystem.\n9.\nEnsure trust between devices and participants.\nIn view\
    \ of the above challenges, in order to improve the\nIndustrial Internet environment,\
    \ the integration of block-\nchain technology into IIoT network has become a new\n\
    research hotspot. Blockchain technology provides a new\nsolution to solve the\
    \ problems of standardization, trace-\nability, auditability, interoperability,\
    \ security and trust of\nIIoT:\n1.\nIn terms of standardization, many automation\
    \ devices\nin IIoT use various protocols in the operation process,\nbut these\
    \ protocols do not have a set of speciﬁed\nstandard management, that’s why it\
    \ is difﬁcult to\nensure interoperability between devices. The dis-\ntributed\
    \ ledger technology and smart contract for\nblockchain contributed to the implementation\
    \ of stan-\ndardized management. Speciﬁcally, by formulating the\ncorresponding\
    \ protocol identiﬁcation for each protocol\nand storing it in the smart contract,\
    \ it can be called\nduring heterogeneous communication, so as to further\nimprove\
    \ the interoperability between devices.\n2.\nIn terms of traceability and auditability,\
    \ all nodes in the\nblockchain network hold a transaction record ledger\nwith\
    \ timestamp, and users can use the corresponding\ntimestamp to verify and track\
    \ historical data records.\nMoreover, the tamper proof of blockchain can ensure\n\
    Wireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n675\n123\nthe authenticity of data, which\
    \ it can easily detect and\neliminate these bad data when the data is modiﬁed.\n\
    These features provide traceability and auditability for\nthe IIoT and promote\
    \ the sharing of stored data.\n3.\nIn terms of interoperability, due to the application\
    \ of\ninterconnected heterogeneous devices in the IIoT, a lot\nof data will be\
    \ generated, which has high requirements\nfor interoperability. How to reduce\
    \ the operation cost\nand complexity of deployment when improving inter-\noperability,\
    \ and further improve the bridging of shared\ndata is a huge challenge. Blockchain\
    \ technology can\npotentially meet this challenge. Speciﬁcally, the data\ntypes\
    \ of heterogeneous devices in IIoT are stored in the\nblockchain after data processing\
    \ such as formats\nconversion, processing, presentation and compression,\nand\
    \ the corresponding data access rules and other\ninformation are stored in the\
    \ blockchain. According to\nthe same standards formulated by different entities,\n\
    blockchain can also ensure the interoperability of data\nexchanges processes between\
    \ different entities.\n4.\nIn terms of security, blockchain is based on cryptog-\n\
    raphy and can use advanced encryption methods to\nensure data security and privacy.\
    \ And the decentralized\nnature of blockchain can resist security threats brought\n\
    by third parties and enhance credibility. In addition, by\nstoring the privacy\
    \ protection policy and access control\npolicy into the smart contract, which\
    \ is automatically\nexecuted according to the trigger conditions, the user’s\n\
    data security and ownership were ensured.\n5.\nIn terms of trust, the interaction\
    \ between entities in the\ntraditional IoT depends on the centralized architecture,\n\
    which cannot guarantee the trust in entities. However,\nblockchain technology\
    \ uses distributed ledger technol-\nogy and the consensus protocol to improve\
    \ the\ntransparency of data exchange. In addition, the data\ninvariance and traceability\
    \ of blockchain technology\nmade it possible to solve the failure problems existing\n\
    on the interaction between heterogeneous devices and\ncomplex information providers.\
    \ The use of smart\ncontract can achieve autonomous interaction without\nany third\
    \ party, saving operating costs. The above\nfunctions contribute to ensuring the\
    \ trust in entities in\nIIoT and to achieve direct interaction between entities.\n\
    In the future, IIoT technology will continue to develop with\nthe trend of intelligent\
    \ terminal, ubiquitous connection,\nmarginalized computing, ﬂat network and service\
    \ platform,\nand the application potential for blockchain technology in\nthe development\
    \ trend above will continue to be tapped\n[200]. How to integrate and innovate\
    \ blockchain technol-\nogy, IIoT, 5G and other new generation digital technolo-\n\
    gies will be a major challenge, we will discuss it in\nSect. 6.3.2.\n6.3.2 Industry\
    \ 4.0\nIndustry 4.0 is speciﬁcally deﬁned as a collective term of\ntechnologies\
    \ and concepts used by the organizations of\nvalue chain, and it also is a trend\
    \ of using information to\nsimplify processes and integrate automation in new\
    \ tech-\nnology development [203]. Its theoretical basis is the\ndynamic optimization\
    \ of production resources within and\nbetween highly interconnected factories,\
    \ and its technical\nbasis is CPS, which aims at improving the degree of\nindustrial\
    \ autonomy and reduce the waste of human capital\n[204, 205]. Industry 4.0 can\
    \ be roughly divided into three\ndevelopment stages [206–209], and the digital\
    \ thinking\nused can be divided into three generations, as shown in\nFig. 20.\n\
    The ﬁrst stage of Industry 4.0 is industrial manufactur-\ning automation. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ industrial robots and indus-\ntrial automation are technical power, which main\
    \ purpose\nis to reduce human investment and ﬁnally make unmanned\nfactories come\
    \ true. At present, most factories are still in\nthis stage. The second stage\
    \ of Industry 4.0 is data ﬂow\nautomation. IoT, IIoT, cloud computing, big data\
    \ and\nartiﬁcial intelligence are its technical power. Among them,\nIoT, as the\
    \ main power, can establish digital twins [210]\nwith the help of industrial software,\
    \ such as ERP, MES,\nPLM and other information systems. However, only by\ncombining\
    \ cloud computing technology, big data analysis\ntechnology and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ technology can real-\nize real data ﬂow automation and present the complete\n\
    form of intelligent manufacturing. At present, Siemens, GE\nand other enterprises\
    \ have basically realized digitization.\nThe third stage of Industry 4.0 is economic\
    \ operation\nautomation, and blockchain is its driving force. Blockchain\ntechnology\
    \ can effectively improve the persistence and\nsecurity of IoT applications, and\
    \ its smart contract can\nfurther ensure automation. In addition, blockchain tech-\n\
    nology helps to realize data monetization and further pro-\nmote the development\
    \ of industrial economy automation.\nFurthermore, in the development of Industry\
    \ 4.0, it is also\ninseparable from the application of digital thinking. As the\n\
    third generation of digital thinking, blockchain technology\nmainly realizes the\
    \ integration of data and programs\nthrough blockchain smart contracts. If the\
    \ data has its own\nprogram, it has the function of identiﬁcation. The data can\n\
    be used to determine the authority, and then transformed\ninto digital assets\
    \ to promote the development of digital\neconomy. In addition, the consensus among\
    \ humans,\nmachines and different network organizations made the\nbottom industrial\
    \ blockchain possible to support complex\nsocio-economic operation. In the future,\
    \ the digital econ-\nomy with blockchain as the core will run through various\n\
    application ﬁelds.\n676\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\nApplication\

    \ can execute heterogeneous commu-\nnication protocols of the value chain of intelligent\n\
    manufacturing, and automatically perform access\ncontrols, authentication and\
    \ other editable logic\nfunctions. In addition, all transaction protocols can\n\
    be automatically executed by smart contract, so that\nthe transaction can be executed\
    \ with the character-\nistics of low cost and high efﬁciency, ensuring the\ncredibility\
    \ and authenticity of the transaction.\n9.\nSmart contract can provide speciﬁc\
    \ storage space for\napplications, and smart contracts can call each other,\n\
    which providing system ﬂexibility and providing a\nlot of personalized manufacturing\
    \ services.\n10.\nIt helps to improve the ﬁnancial and trades part of\nindustrial\
    \ 4.0 ecology, provide democratic data\nmonetization, and allow users to conduct\

    \ cloud\nplatform, it can achieve distributed storage on and\noff the chain, and\
    \ improve the robustness of system\nstorage.\n12.\nWith the integration of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence algo-\nrithm, cognitive conﬁguration and operation can be\nrealized.\
    \ Using smart contract to save interaction\nrules can standardize cooperation\
    \ and credit mech-\nanisms between manufacturing resources. Taking\nblockchain\
    \ as one of the additional digital twins of\nmanufacturing process can protect\
    \ the data of shared\nprocess, which promotes the development of open\nmanufacturing\
    \ ecosystem.\nBlockchain smart contract technology can trigger exe-\ncution when\
    \ conditions are met, which reduces human\nintervention, making applications for\
    \ IIoT more powerful\nand secure. Its data security will also bring additional\n\
    advantages to 5G technology, big data and artiﬁcial intel-\nligence [211–213].\
    \ However, how to integrate and innovate\nblockchain technology with other information\
    \ technologies\nand give full play to its potential value of application is the\n\
    biggest challenge at present. The challenges faced by the\nintegration of blockchain\
    \ technology and IIoT are as fol-\nlows [214–217]:\n1.\nResource energy consumption:\
    \ blockchain is a tech-\nnology with high performance requirements, such as\n\
    mining, which requires very high energy consumption.\nThere is a great contradiction\
    \ between the high energy\nconsumption demand of blockchain and the low\nprocessing\
    \ capacity of IoT equipment. In addition,\nthe blockchain requires each node to\
    \ store a sub ledger,\nwhich leads to the storage pressure caused by data\nexpansion.\
    \ Moreover, the device node itself does not\nhave large storage capacity. Although\
    \ many solutions\nusing the cloud platform or IPFS as off-chain storage\nhas been\
    \ proposed, they cannot well solve the problem\nof storage pressure [154, 218,\
    \ 219]. The performance\nof blockchain will also affect the efﬁciency after\n\
    integration. To solve these problems, using Merkel tree\nfor the data compression,\
    \ improvement of consensus\nmechanism, chip technology and IOTA are the main\n\
    solutions.\n2.\nPartition tolerance problem: due to the relatively cheap\nIIoT\
    \ equipment, there is a problem of equipment node\nloss caused by equipment idle\
    \ or discarding. In order to\nensure data consistency, it takes longer to update\
    \ all\nnode data, which results in reduced availability. At\npresent, the main\
    \ method to solve this problem is the\nsimultaneous trading mechanism on and off\
    \ the chain\n[220].\n3.\nScalability: the blockchain provides a certain degree\
    \ of\ndecentralization, security and fault tolerance at the cost\nof scalability.\
    \ With the growth of the chain and the\nimprovement of consensus algorithm, the\
    \ demand for\nstorage, bandwidth and computing power are also\nincreasing. In\
    \ IIoT, massive devices will generate huge\namounts of data in real time, resulting\
    \ in the aggrava-\ntion of low throughput and scalability problems. At\npresent,\
    \ the main solutions include slicing technology,\nside-chain technology, storage\
    \ and processing of data\non off-chain, and limiting the scope of consensus for\n\
    the blockchain network.\n4.\nSecurity issues: the blockchain encrypts data with\n\
    complex cryptography, which limits auditability and\nsharing governance. In addition,\
    \ blockchain is still\nvulnerable to 51% attacks, DoS attacks and eclipse\nattacks\
    \ [221], which hinders the progress of consensus.\nTherefore, the improvement\
    \ of consensus mechanism\nis still an urgent problem to be solved. In addition,\
    \ in\norder to prevent attackers from exploiting smart\ncontract vulnerabilities,\
    \ it is also very important to\nformulate security standards without security\
    \ threats.\n5.\nCommunication and delay problem: blockchain tech-\nnology takes\
    \ P2P network as the underlying commu-\nnication infrastructure, and equipment\
    \ nodes need to\ncontinuously transmit and exchange data, which puts\nforward\n\
    high\nrequirements\nfor\nthe\ncapacity\nand\nefﬁciency of wireless communication.\
    \ In addition,\ndue to the mobility of IIoT devices, the performance of\nblockchain\
    \ protocol will be reduced, making it more\ndifﬁcult to ensure the synchronization\
    \ of data between\nmobile nodes. The high delay of consensus mechanism\nhinders\
    \ the development of industrial applications\nrequiring high real-time performance.\n\
    6.\nIntegration standard problem: at present, the integra-\ntion of blockchain\
    \ and IIoT is still in the primary stage,\nwhile there are many development platforms\
    \ of\nblockchain, and the architecture and protocol existing\n678\nWireless Networks\
    \ (2022) 28:635–690\n123\nindependently, which increases the difﬁculty of inte-\n\
    gration. If integration standards are not formulated,\npotential collaboration\
    \ between different platforms will\nbe limited, resulting in serious compatibility\
    \ problems.\nTherefore, in order to standardize the integration\nprocess, it should\
    \ focus on technical details such as\nnon-standard heterogeneous communication\
    \ protocol,\nequipment integration and conﬁguration, service set-\ntings and payment,\
    \ so as to build a general functional\narchitecture of IIoT based on blockchain.\n\
    After the integration of blockchain and IIoT, the horizontal\napplications are\
    \ mainly to open-up the whole IIoT indus-\ntrial chain, improve data quality and\
    \ utilization value,\nachieve efﬁcient data collection and sharing, and establish\n\
    a good IIoT ecology. The vertical applications are mainly\nin the ﬁeld of intelligent\
    \ manufacturing to realize the\nreliable, safe and efﬁcient management of equipment\n\
    identity and data. Blockchain is the digital cornerstone of\nthe in-depth intelligent\
    \ scene of IIoT. It can realize the\ndigital\nintegration\nchannel\nof\nthe\n\
    industrial\nchain,\nstrengthen the ecological consensus, promote the in-depth\n\
    integration between the chain and the chain, and achieve\nthe sustainable development\
    \ of the distributed intelligent\nnetwork.\n7 Future research direction\n7.1 Challenges\
    \ for smart contract\nWith the popularity and application of blockchain tech-\n\
    nology, emerging smart contract technology has attracted\nextensive attention\
    \ in academia and industry. However, on\naccount of smart contract is limited\
    \ by the performance of\nblockchain system itself at present, it is unable to\
    \ process\ncomplex logic and high-throughput data, as well as lack\nprivacy protection\
    \ to a certain extent. Furthermore, it is\nstill some difﬁculties to achieve the\
    \ cross chain. Therefore,\nsmart contracts are facing four challenges now [222]:\
    \ pri-\nvacy, performance, the design and security of mechanism,\nand formal veriﬁcation,\
    \ and the speciﬁc explanation for\nthem is as follows:\n1.\nAccording to the operation\
    \ mechanism of smart\ncontract, the privacy issues of smart contract can be\n\
    divided into trusted data source privacy issues and\ncontract data privacy issues,\
    \ and involve the infras-\ntructure layer and the contract layer in the infrastruc-\n\
    ture model [223]. In addition, the anonymity of\nblockchain does not completely\
    \ solve the privacy\nproblem of smart contract, that is because they need to\n\
    ask the blockchain system to query external cred-\nitable sources when some smart\
    \ contracts are executed,\nand these requests are usually open, and user privacy\n\
    will be threatened. Consequently, it is urgent to solve\nthe privacy security\
    \ problem of smart contract, as a\nresult of these problems of privacy may lead\
    \ to\nanonymous attacks on blockchain or smart contract.\n2.\nThe performance\
    \ problems of smart contract can be\ndivided into two categories: the performance\
    \ problems\nof contract caused by the design of contract layer, and\nthe blockchain\
    \ system performance problems caused\nby the infrastructure layer. On the one\
    \ hand, the\nmechanism design of contract and the smart contract to\nbe optimized\
    \ will increase the execution cost and\nreduce the execution efﬁciency. On the\
    \ other hand, the\nperformance problems of blockchain system, such as\nlow throughput,\
    \ transaction delay, high energy con-\nsumption, capacity and bandwidth constraints,\
    \ will also\nlimit the performance of smart contract to a certain\nextent. Taking\
    \ the throughput limit of blockchain\nsystem as an example, for smart contracts\
    \ are executed\nserially in sequence in the current blockchain system,\nthe number\
    \ of contracts that can be executed per\nsecond is very limited. Moreover, smart\
    \ contracts are\nalso not compatible with the popular multi-core and\ncluster\
    \ architecture, thus difﬁcult to meet the needs of\nmulti-domain applications\
    \ [224].\n3.\nThe security problem in the execution-layer is the main\nproblem\
    \ that restricts the development of smart\ncontract. This is due to smart contract\
    \ deployed on\nthe chain is irreversible, furthermore, its problems of\npotential\
    \ security will be difﬁcult to repair if triggered,\nwhich the resulting economic\
    \ losses will be irreparable.\nAt the same time, the anonymity of the blockchain\
    \ may\nprovide convenience for malicious users, and then\nresult in real-world\
    \ application security problems.\n4.\nFormal veriﬁcation in the operation and\
    \ maintenance\nlayer is an important method to address the security\nproblem of\
    \ smart contract, and also an important\nresearch direction of it [225]. The formal\
    \ veriﬁcation\nof smart contract refers to the use of precise mathe-\nmatical\
    \ means and powerful analysis tools, to verify\nwhether the smart contract meets\
    \ the expected key-\nproperties of fairness, boundedness, correctness, real-\n\
    izability and non-ambiguity in the process of contract\ndesign, development and\
    \ testing. Thereby to regulate\nthe generation and execution of contracts and\
    \ improve\nthe reliability and execution, and further scale the\nefﬁcient generation\
    \ of smart contracts. Thus, it is an\nimportant way to address the security problem\
    \ of smart\ncontract. In addition, formal veriﬁcation before con-\ntract deployment\
    \ can avoid some common security\nvulnerabilities. There are some security checking\
    \ tools\nfor static or dynamic analysis of contracts at present,\nsuch as Oyente\
    \ and Porosity. But most of these\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n679\n\
    123\nveriﬁcation tools are still in the experimental stage, and\ntheir reliability\
    \ has not been veriﬁed in real systems.\nAs a consequence, there is still an urgent\
    \ need for a\ncomplete, standardized and instructive formal veriﬁca-\ntion framework\
    \ in the market, and it will make formal\nveriﬁcation an important development\
    \ direction of\nsmart contracts in the future [32].\nBesides the issues of smart\
    \ contract itself, it also faces\ndifferent challenges in the application process\
    \ of different\nplatforms, as shown below:\n1.\nIn the Ethereum platform, smart\
    \ contract mainly faces\nthe following challenges: ﬁrst, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd\
    \ out\nwhere the transaction went wrong for the process of\ndebugging a smart\
    \ contract is very complicated;\nsecond, Ethereum needs manual operation to connect\n\
    with other software, which will increase the burden of\ndevelopers; third, Ethereum\
    \ developers must build the\ninfrastructure of Ethereum nodes individually, and\
    \ it\nmay lead to hidden risks; fourth, the update of smart\ncontract has become\
    \ an urgent problem, because the\ncode incorporated into Ethereum that is a decentralized\n\
    platform cannot be modiﬁed; Finally, building a future\nproof architecture is\
    \ also one of the challenges must\nface [226].\n2.\nIn the Hyperledger platform,\
    \ although the emergence\nof blockchain smart contract technology has a signif-\n\
    icant impact on the business model of enterprises, it\nalso faces two challenges\
    \ [227]: One is the poor\nscalability of the system. For the consortium block-\n\
    chain system adopts efﬁcient consensus protocol to\nimprove the efﬁciency of system\
    \ data processing, it\nleads to the limitation of system scale scalability. For\n\
    instance, when the number of nodes exceeds a certain\nlevel, the system using\
    \ BFT consensus protocol\ntransmits a lot of messages between nodes, and it will\n\
    result in a signiﬁcant decline in the throughput of\nsystem; the other is the\
    \ cost of deployment and\nmaintenance is high. Despite the blockchain system\n\
    that is geared to the needs of the consortium blockchain\napplication design,\
    \ it has a high degree of technical\nmaturity. There are few related third-party\
    \ support\ntools for this kind of system is not as open as the public\nblockchain.\
    \ In addition, if they want to implement the\nspecial function of data management,\
    \ consortium\nmembers require developing tools by themselves, and\nit\nwill\n\
    increase\nthe\ncost\nof\ndeployment\nand\nmaintenance.\n3.\nFor EOSIO platform,\
    \ EOS has a developing space in\nthe long run. As the carrying capacity of EOS\
    \ is\nstrengthened and the development threshold is getting\nlower and lower,\
    \ EOS has more large-scale application\nspace. At the same time, the growth of\
    \ currency price\nalso has development space with the demand for EOS\nincreases\
    \ [228]. What’s more, once the goal that the\nEOS virtual machine can make DApp\
    \ run smoothly is\nrealized, EOS will carry large-scale commercial appli-\ncations,\
    \ but the rigid demand for EOS in blockchain\nhas not been obvious now. However,\
    \ the governance of\nEOS ecosystem is the most difﬁcult problem to address\nfor\
    \ the EOS program needs the master node to run.\nNamely, if the master node refuses\
    \ to run, the program\ncan’t be executed even if it is approved by the whole\n\
    people. Therefore, the complete off-chain governance\ncannot solve the problem\
    \ of governance. Making\nchanges in the code, such as the referendum system\n\
    written into the code that the referendum to determine\nthe branch of the program\
    \ operation, may play a certain\nrole in solving the EOS governance problem.\n\
    The\ntamper\nproof,\nconsistency,\nauditability\nand\nautomation of blockchain\
    \ smart contract can facilitate the\ndevelopment of DApp. With the development\
    \ of smart\ncontract technology, the application of blockchain smart\ncontract\
    \ has been extended to IIoT, intelligent manufac-\nturing, value chains and other\
    \ ﬁelds, but its loopholes and\ntechnical problems will pose potential security\
    \ threats:\n1.\nPerformance: in order to improve the performance of\nsmart contract\
    \ that limited by the performance of the\nblockchain system itself, the proposed\
    \ Layer 2 scaling\nsolution [229] is a feasible method to greatly improve\nthe\
    \ performance of smart contract. It creates an isolated\noff-chain execution environment\
    \ for smart contract\nthrough cloud platforms, IPFS and other storage\nplatforms,\
    \ separating the implementation of smart\ncontract from the consensus mechanism\
    \ of the public\nblockchain, which achieving some on-chain operations\nand off-chain\
    \ management, so as to conducive the\nrealization of smart contract with high-performance,\n\
    high privacy and cross chains.\n2.\nSecurity: the security issues of smart contract\
    \ are\nmainly divided into code, operating environment and\nthe blockchain platform.\
    \ There are many security\nproblems in the contract code (integer overﬂow\nvulnerability,\
    \ the restriction of gas, etc.), which is\nmainly solved by vulnerability detection\
    \ scheme. The\nsecurity problems of the operating environment mainly\nrefer to\
    \ the security vulnerabilities of the virtual\nmachine, the docker container and\
    \ image itself. The\nsecurity problem of blockchain platform mainly refers\nto\
    \ the vulnerability of encryption algorithms (reuse\nproblem) and consensus algorithms\
    \ (replay attack). To\nsolve these problems, the security audit strategy of\n\
    smart contract can be effectively solved.\n3.\nQuantum attack: since the blockchain\
    \ platform is based\non cryptography, but Grover and Shor algorithms\n680\nWireless\
    \ Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n123\nposed an important threat to public key cryptography\n\
    and hash functions [230], and affect the security of\nsmart contract. Therefore,\
    \ it is necessary to design an\nanti-quantum blockchain system to withstand potential\n\
    quantum attacks. At present, the InterValue project has\nproposed a new anti-quantum\
    \ attack cryptographic\nalgorithm, but the development of anti-quantum attack\n\
    blockchain is still of great signiﬁcance to the security\nand future extended\
    \ application of blockchain.\n4.\nStandardization problem: at the legal level,\
    \ the authen-\nticity of the smart contract is insufﬁcient (Oracle needs\nto provide\
    \ real data), which leads to the problem that\nthe contract is irrevocable in\
    \ case of major misunder-\nstanding. And the smart contract is not predictable,\
    \ so\nit is impossible to predict the trend of the situation.\nEstablishing and\
    \ improving contract legal audit, com-\nbining with artiﬁcial intelligence to\
    \ achieve pre-\ndictability\nand\nintelligent\ndecision-making\nare\npotential\
    \ solutions. In addition, when blockchain is\nintegrated with IIoT, it is necessary\
    \ to formulate\nintegration standards through smart contracts.\n5.\nIntelligence:\
    \ the current smart contract only realizes\nthe function of automation and does\
    \ not have intelli-\ngence. With the continuous advancement of the\napplication\
    \ of blockchain in Industry 4.0, its distributed\narchitecture and digital assets\
    \ makes it possible for the\ninteraction between the physical world and the virtual\n\
    network, and put forward the requirements of intelli-\ngent cooperation for smart\
    \ contract. The integration of\nartiﬁcial intelligence technologies such as deep\
    \ learn-\ning and cognitive computing with smart contract\nprovides a potential\
    \ possibility for the further intellec-\ntualization of smart contract.\n6.\n\
    Improvement of DAG-based blockchain smart con-\ntract: the unique DAG ledger structure\
    \ of DAG-based\nblockchain not only improves the consensus efﬁciency,\nbut also\
    \ brings difﬁculties in system state migration\nand consistency maintenance, which\
    \ brings challenges\nto the realization of Turing’s complete smart contract.\n\
    Realizing Turing complete smart contract on DAG\nledger structure is facing the\
    \ severe challenge that the\naccount status may be modiﬁed by new transactions\n\
    during the contract execution. At present, the main\nsolutions are pre prevention\
    \ mechanism (Vite project)\nand ex post rollback mechanism (InterValue project).\n\
    Although the ISCP proposed by IOTA is committed to\nrealizing functions similar\
    \ to Ethereum smart contract,\nit is still in its infancy.\n7.2 Sustainable development\
    \ of blockchain\nsmart contract\nWith the advent of the Industrial Internet era,\
    \ Internet\ntechnology will be fully embedded in the industrial system,\nand will\
    \ break the traditional production process, the pro-\nduction mode, and the management\
    \ mode. As a new engine\nfor the development of the digital economy, Industrial\n\
    Internet continues to expand the new space for the devel-\nopment of the digital\
    \ economy [231]. Artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence, 5G technology and blockchain, as the\
    \ three major\nscientiﬁc and technological ﬁelds in the world, to promote\nthe\
    \ innovation and progress of industrial Internet. Among\nthem, artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ is an important driving tech-\nnology of Industry 4.0, and blockchain, as the\
    \ main force to\nchange data storage, has the potential to reshape the\nInternet\
    \ and IoT. The signiﬁcance of blockchain smart\ncontract technology to the Industrial\
    \ Internet is that it is\nexpected to improve the intelligent conﬁguration ability\
    \ of\nproduction factors in all links of industrial manufacturing\n[210],\nstrengthen\n\
    the\nnetwork\ncollaboration\nbetween\nupstream and downstream of the industrial\
    \ chain, and\nachieve man–machine collaboration based on certain rules\nor protocols\
    \ through smart contract. Blockchain can per-\nfectly help the Industrial Internet\
    \ connect the physical\nworld and the virtual world, and provide basic guarantee\n\
    for intelligence, but its biggest bottleneck lies in how the\noff-chain physical\
    \ world goes on-chain, which is also the\ntechnical difﬁculty for the further\
    \ sustainable development\nof blockchain smart contract. In order to realize the\
    \ large-\nscale application of blockchain smart contract technology,\nits future\
    \ development direction is as follows:\n1.\nImprove the execution efﬁciency: using\
    \ WASM virtual\nmachine to develop smart contracts can improve the\nsecurity and\
    \ performance of trusted execution envi-\nronment, facilitate the implementation\
    \ of customized\nservices, and signiﬁcantly improve the execution\nefﬁciency.\
    \ However, it is difﬁcult to learn the devel-\nopment language based on WASM,\
    \ so use of WASM\nvirtual machine coverage still needs to be further\nimproved.\n\
    2.\nCross chain support: combined with the cloud platform\nand edge technology\
    \ to realize on-chain management\nand off-chain storage, which can improve the\
    \ efﬁ-\nciency of automatic process execution and reduce the\nstorage pressure\
    \ of the system.\n3.\nOptimization\nof\nencryption\nalgorithm:\nencryption\nalgorithm\
    \ is not only an important factor affecting\nthe contract performance, but also\
    \ a technical difﬁ-\nculty.\nThe\noptimization\nof\nencryption\nalgorithm\nfocuses\
    \ on anti-quantum attack.\nWireless Networks (2022) 28:635–690\n681\n123\n4.\n\
    Blockchain is deeply integrated with artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence, so that the equipment\
    \ nodes can interact and\ncooperate through smart contract, and improve the\n\
    robustness and ﬂexibility of the blockchain system.\n5.\nCombined with ACP (artistic\
    \ systems, computational\nexperiments, parallel execution) method [232] to\nrealize\
    \ parallel organization and social management\ndriven by smart contract.\n6.\n\
    Realize the deep interaction with Blockchain Oracle,\nbut the security and credibility\
    \ of the data source\nprovided by Oracle still needs to be further improved.\n\
    However, in order to achieve the sustainable development\nof blockchain smart\
    \ contract, it is necessary to solve the\nproblems of social resources and energy\
    \ consumption and\nenvironmental pollution caused by the mining mechanism.\nThe\
    \ basic principle of mining mechanism is PoW con-\nsensus mechanism [233]. Due\
    \ to the mining machines used\nin mining (the ASIC mining machine of Bitcoin and\
    \ the\ngraphics card mining machine of Ethereum), it often needs\nto consume huge\
    \ power resources. In addition, the main-\ntenance cost of mining chips and graphics\
    \ cards is also\nhigh. Obviously, energy consumption caused by mining\ncannot\
    \ be ignored. Although the Bitcoin mining industry is\ntransforming to clean energy,\
    \ most of the power consumed\nby the Bitcoin network still comes from non-renewable\n\
    energy, such as coal-ﬁred power plants. As we all know,\nburning fossil fuels\
    \ such as coal will release a large amount\nof carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,\
    \ which is also one of\nthe main factors of climate change. This means that the\n\
    more mining computing devices join the bitcoin network,\nthe greater the demand\
    \ for the energy generation and\nconsumption and the greater the impact on the\
    \ environment\n[234]. At present, in order to solve the problem of energy\nconsumption,\
    \ in addition to controlling the mining scale\nand avoiding disorderly competition,\
    \ the purpose of energy\nconservation and environmental protection can also be\n\
    achieved by optimizing the mining mechanism.\nBTC adopts mining based on PoW mechanism,\
    \ which\nconsumes a lot of computing power and power, and has\n51% of the potential\
    \ security risks of attack. The mining of\nETH adopts PoW ? PoS mechanism. Although\
    \ the power\nconsumption is low, the monetary value is not high. By\nimproving\
    \ PoS consensus, Filecoin realizes mining based\non POST (proof of space time)\
    \ mechanism, which is\nmining by putting into a lot of storage space and bandwidth\n\
    resources, which is environmentally friendly and efﬁcient.\nThe disadvantage of\
    \ PoS based mechanism lies in low\nsecurity and low degree of decentralization.\
    \ In addition, the\nprime currency proposed by Sunny King is also one of the\n\
    solutions [235], which is to ﬁnd the prime chain in the\nmining process, so that\
    \ a large amount of energy consumed\nin the mining process can produce value cryptocurrency\n\
    and improve the value of energy. For the problem of high\nenergy consumption caused\
    \ by mining, the use of renew-\nable energy is the best solution, but it is difﬁcult.\
    \ Another\nsolution is to realize the multi-user of energy on the basis\nof maintaining\
    \ security.\nIn the future, blockchain technology will be deeply\nintegrated with\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, which means that\nproductivity and production relations\
    \ will change. The\ndevelopment of artiﬁcial intelligence, 5 g, Internet of\n\
    things and other technologies will lead to security problems\nand public governance\
    \ problems caused by the increase in\nthe number of agents. Smart contract can\
    \ deal with the\ntransaction behavior of agents, authorize and supervise\nagents,\n\
    and\nintegrate\nfragmented\nindividual\ninterests\neffectively and at low cost.\
    \ Blockchain can quantify and\nimprove the cognitive level of nodes, provide solutions\
    \ for\nnetwork security, provide new impetus for overcoming\ncollective action\
    \ problems in intelligent society, and ensure\nthe credibility and security of\
    \ industrial Internet. In addi-\ntion, blockchain helps to eliminate the structural\
    \ holes\ncaused by information asymmetry, establish direct links\nbetween producers\
    \ and consumers, weaken the role of\nintermediary platform, and directly participate\
    \ in economic\ndistribution through frameworks such as deliberative\ndemocracy\
    \ and agent mechanism, so as to promote the\ndevelopment of global value chain\
    \ [236].\n8 Conclusions\nThis paper introduces the research status of application,\n\
    existing problems and solutions for blockchain smart\ncontract. Firstly, we systematically\
    \ introduce the model\nand operation principle of blockchain smart contract, ana-\n\
    lyzes the deployment process of smart contract based on\nEthereum, Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric and EOSIO, and compares\nthe advantages and disadvantages of developing\
    \ smart\ncontract on the three platforms. In addition, we compare\nand analyze\
    \ the blockchain with DAG-based blockchain,\nand introduces the deployment process\
    \ of DAG-based\nsmart contract by taking Byteball, InterValue and IOTA\nplatforms\
    \ as examples. Secondly, we summarize the\napplication research of blockchain\
    \ smart contract in the\nworld, and further discusses the research of Blockchain\n\
    Oracle, to promote the further integration of smart contract\ninto practical application.\

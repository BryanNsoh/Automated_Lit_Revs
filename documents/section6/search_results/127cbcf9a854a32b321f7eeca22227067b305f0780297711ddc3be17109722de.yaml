    • Big Data is expected to have a large impact on Smart Farming and involves the
    whole supply chain. • Smart sensors and devices produce big amounts of data that
    provide unprecedented decision-making capabilities. • Big Data is expected to
    cause major shifts in roles and power relations among traditional and non-traditional
    players. • Governance (incl. data ownership, privacy, security) and business models
    are key issues to be addressed in future research. Abstract Smart Farming is a
    development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology
    in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet
    of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce
    more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the
    phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be
    captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight
    into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify
    the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured
    approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used
    for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing
    the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights
    in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business
    processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest
    that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different
    players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits
    an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often
    small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions
    that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be
    guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme
    scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly
    integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer
    and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business
    partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further
    development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards)
    and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between
    these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give
    research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable
    business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios. Previous

    As smart machines and sensors crop up on farms and farm data grow in quantity
    and scope, farming processes will become increasingly data-driven and data-enabled.
    Rapid developments in the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are propelling
    the phenomenon of what is called Smart Farming (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). While
    Precision Agriculture is just taking in-field variability into account, Smart
    Farming goes beyond that by basing management tasks not only on location but also
    on data, enhanced by context- and situation awareness, triggered by real-time
    events (Wolfert et al., 2014). Real-time assisting reconfiguration features are
    required to carry out agile actions, especially in cases of suddenly changed operational
    conditions or other circumstances (e.g. weather or disease alert). These features
    typically include intelligent assistance in implementation, maintenance and use
    of the technology. Fig. 1 summarizes the concept of Smart Farming along the management
    cycle as a cyber-physical system, which means that smart devices - connected to
    the Internet - are controlling the farm system. Smart devices extend conventional
    tools (e.g. rain gauge, tractor, notebook) by adding autonomous context-awareness
    by all kind of sensors, built-in intelligence, capable to execute autonomous actions
    or doing this remotely. In this picture it is already suggested that robots can
    play an important role in control, but it can be expected that the role of humans
    in analysis and planning is increasingly assisted by machines so that the cyber-physical
    cycle becomes almost autonomous. Humans will always be involved in the whole process
    but increasingly at a much higher intelligence level, leaving most operational
    activities to machines. Download : Download high-res image (142KB) Download :

    Farming enhanced by cloud-based event and data management (Wolfert et al., 2014).
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential, reciprocal role in this development:
    machines are equipped with all kind of sensors that measure data in their environment
    that is used for the machines'' behaviour. This varies from relatively simple
    feedback mechanisms (e.g. a thermostat regulating temperature) to deep learning
    algorithms (e.g. to implement the right crop protection strategy). This is leveraged
    by combining with other, external Big Data sources such as weather or market data
    or benchmarks with other farms. Due to rapid developments in this area, a unifying
    definition of Big Data is difficult to give, but generally it is a term for data
    sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications
    are inadequate (Wikipedia, 2016). Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies
    with new forms of integration to reveal insights from datasets that are diverse,
    complex, and of a massive scale (Hashem et al., 2015). Big Data represents the
    information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity and variety to
    require specific technology and analytical methods for its transformation into
    value (De Mauro et al., 2016). The Data FAIRport initiative emphasizes the more
    operational dimension of Big Data by providing the FAIR principle meaning that
    data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (Data FAIRport,
    2014). This also implies the importance of metadata i.e. ‘data about the data’
    (e.g. time, location, standards used, etc.). Both Big Data and Smart Farming are
    relatively new concepts, so it is expected that knowledge about their applications
    and their implications for research and development is not widely spread. Some
    authors refer to the advent of Big Data and related technology as another technology
    hype that may fail to materialize, others consider Big Data applications may have
    passed the ‘peak of inflated expectations’ in Gartner''s Hype Cycle (Fenn and
    LeHong, 2011, Needle, 2015). This review aims to provide insight into the state-of-the-art
    of Big Data applications in relation to Smart Farming and to identify the most
    important research and development challenges to be addressed in the future. In
    reviewing the literature, attention is paid to both technical and socio-economic
    aspects. However, technology is changing rapidly in this area and a state-of-the-art
    of that will probably be outdated soon after this paper is published. Therefore
    the analysis primarily focuses on the socio-economic impact Big Data will have
    on farm management and the whole network around it because it is expected that
    this will have a longer-lasting effect. From that perspective the research questions
    to be addressed in this review are: 1. What role does Big Data play in Smart Farming?
    2. What stakeholders are involved and how are they organized? 3. What are the
    expected changes that are caused by Big Data developments? 4. What challenges
    need to be addressed in relation to the previous questions? The latter question
    can be considered as a research agenda for the future. To answer these questions
    and to structure the review process, a conceptual framework for analysis has been
    developed, which is expected to be useful also for future analyses of developments
    in Big Data and Smart Farming. In the remainder of this paper the methodology
    for reviewing the literature (Section 2) and the framework will be described (Section
    3). Then the main results from the analysis will be presented in Section 4. Section
    5 concludes the review and provides recommendations for further research and actions.
    2. Methodology To address the research questions as outlined in the Introduction,
    we surveyed literature between January 2010 and March 2015. The choice of the
    review period was a practical one and took into consideration the fact that Big
    Data is a rather recent phenomenon; it was not expected that there would be any
    reference before 2010. Beside the period of publication, we used two inclusion
    criteria for the literature search: 1) full article publication; 2) relevance
    to the research question. Two exclusion criteria were used: 1) articles published
    in languages other than English or Chinese; 2) articles focussing solely on technological
    design. The literature survey followed a systematic approach. This was done in
    three steps. In the first step we searched two major bibliographical databases,
    Web of Science and Scopus, using all combinations of two groups of keywords of
    which the first group addresses Big Data (i.e. Big Data, data-driven innovation,
    data-driven value creation, internet of things, IoT) and the second group refers
    to farming (i.e. agriculture, farming, food, agri-food, precision agriculture).
    The two databases were chosen because of their wide coverage of relevant literature
    and advanced bibliometric features such as suggesting related literature or citations.
    From these two databases 613 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved. These were
    scanned for relevance by identifying passages that were addressing the research
    questions. In screening the literature, we first used the search function to locate
    the paragraphs containing the key words and then read the text to see whether
    they can be related to the research questions. The screening was done by four
    researchers, with each of them judging about 150 articles and sharing their findings
    with the others through the reference management software EndNote X7. As a result,
    20 were considered most relevant and 94 relevant. The remaining articles were
    considered not relevant as they only tangentially touch upon Big Data or agriculture
    and therefore excluded from further reading and analysis. We found the number
    of relevant peer-reviewed literature not very high which can be explained because
    Big Data and Smart Farming are relatively new concepts. Especially the applications
    are rapidly evolving and expected not to be taken into account in peer-reviewed
    articles which are usually lagging behind. Therefore we decided to also include
    grey literature into our review. For that purpose we have used Google Scholar
    and the search engine LexisNexis for reports, magazines, blogs, and other web-items
    in English. This has resulted in 3 reports, 225 magazine articles, 319 blogs and
    19 items on twitter. Each of the 319 blogs was evaluated on relevance based on
    its title and sentences containing the search terms. Also possible duplications
    were removed. The result was a short list containing 29 blogs that were evaluated
    by further reading. As a result, 9 blogs have been considered as presenting relevant
    information for our framework. Each of the 225 magazine articles was similarly
    evaluated on their relevance based on its title and sentences containing the search
    terms. After removing duplicates, the result is a short list of 25 articles. We
    then read these 25 articles through for further evaluation. Consequently 9 articles
    have been considered as containing relevant information for further analysis.
    In the second step, we read the selected literature in detail to extract the information
    relevant to our research questions. Additional literature that had not been identified
    in the first step was retrieved in this step as well if they were referred to
    by the ‘most relevant’ literature. This ‘snow-ball’ approach has resulted in 11
    additional articles and web-items from which relevant information was extracted
    as well. In the third step, the extracted information was analysed and synthesized
    following the conceptual framework as described in Section 3. 3. Conceptual framework
    For this review a conceptual framework was developed to provide a systematic classification
    of issues and concepts for the analysis of Big Data applications in Smart Farming
    from a socio-economic perspective. A major complexity of such applications is
    that they require collaboration between many different stakeholders having different
    roles in the data value chain. For this reason, the framework draws upon literature
    on chain network management and data-driven strategies. Chain networks are considered
    to be composed of the actors which vertically and horizontally work together to
    add value to customers (Christopher, 2005, Lazzarini et al., 2001, Omta et al.,
    2001). An important foundation of chain networks is the concept ‘value chain’,
    which is a system of interlinked processes, each adding value to the product of
    service (Porter, 1985). In big data applications, the value chain refers to the
    sequence of activities from data capture to decision making and data marketing
    (Chen et al., 2014, Miller and Mork, 2013). The often-cited conceptual framework
    of Lambert and Cooper (2000) on network management comprises three closely interrelated
    elements: the network structure, the business processes, and the management components.
    The network structure consists of the member firms and the links between these
    firms. Business processes are the activities that produce a specific output of
    value to the customer. The management components are the managerial variables
    by which the business processes are integrated and managed across the network.
    The network management component is further divided into a technology and organization
    component. For our purpose the framework was tailored to networks for Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming as presented in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res
    image (306KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Conceptual framework
    for the literature analysis (Adapted from Lambert and Cooper (2000)). In this
    framework, the business processes (lower layer) focus on the generation and use
    of Big Data in the management of farming processes. For this reason, we subdivided
    this part into the data chain, the farm management and the farm processes. The
    data chain interacts with farm processes and farm management processes through
    various decision making processes in which information plays an important role.
    The stakeholder network (middle layer) comprises all stakeholders that are involved
    in these processes, not only users of Big Data but also companies that are specialized
    in data management and regulatory and policy actors. Finally, the network management
    layer typifies the organizational and technological structures in the network
    that facilitate coordination and management of the processes that are performed
    by the actors in the stakeholder network layer. The technology component of network
    management (upper layer) focuses on the information infrastructure that supports
    the data chain. The organizational component focuses on the governance and business
    model of the data chain. Finally, several factors can be identified as key drivers
    for the development of Big Data in Smart Farming and as a result challenges can
    be derived from this development. The next subsections provide a more detailed
    description of each subcomponent of the business processes layer and network management
    layer of the framework. 3.1. Farm processes A business process is a set of logically
    related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome (Davenport and Short,
    1990). Business processes can be subdivided into primary and supporting business
    processes (Davenport, 1993, Porter, 1985). Primary Business Processes are those
    involved in the creation of the product, its marketing and delivery to the buyer
    (Porter, 1985). Supporting Business Processes facilitate the development, deployment
    and maintenance of resources required in primary processes. The business processes
    of farming significantly differ between different types of production, e.g. livestock
    farming, arable farming and greenhouse cultivation. A common feature is that agricultural
    production is depending on natural conditions, such as climate (day length and
    temperature), soil, pests, diseases and weather (Nuthall, 2011). 3.2. Farm management
    Management or control processes ensure that the business process objectives are
    achieved, even if disturbances occur. The basic idea of control is the introduction
    of a controller that measures system behaviour and corrects if measurements are
    not compliant with system objectives. Basically, this implies that they must have
    a feedback loop in which a norm, sensor, discriminator, decision maker, and effector
    are present (Beer, 1981, in ''t Veld, 2002). As a consequence, the basic management
    functions are (Verdouw et al., 2015) (see also Fig. 1): • Sensing and monitoring:
    measurement of the actual performance of the farm processes. This can be done
    manually by a human observer or automated by using sensing technologies such as
    sensors or satellites. In addition, external data can be acquired to complement
    direct observations. • Analysis and decision making: compares measurements with
    the norms that specify the desired performance (system objectives concerning e.g.
    quantity, quality and lead time aspects), signals deviations and decides on the
    appropriate intervention to remove the signalled disturbances. • Intervention:
    plans and implements the chosen intervention to correct the farm processes'' performance.
    3.3. Data chain The data chain refers to the sequence of activities from data
    capture to decision making and data marketing (Chen et al., 2014, Miller and Mork,
    2013). It includes all activities that are needed to manage data for farm management.

    Data applications, based on Chen et al. (2014). Being an integral part of business
    processes, the data chain consists necessarily of a technical layer that captures
    raw data and converts it into information and a business layer that makes decisions
    and derives value from provided data services and business intelligence. The two
    layers can be interwoven in each stage and together they form the basis of what
    has come to be known as the ‘data value chain’ (Dumbill, 2014) (Table 1). Table

    Network management organization The network management organization deals with
    the behaviour of the stakeholders and how it can be influenced to accomplish the
    business process objectives. For the uptake and further development of Big Data
    applications, two interdependent aspects are considered relevant: governance and
    business model. Governance involves the formal and informal arrangements that
    govern cooperation within the stakeholder network. Important arrangements for
    the management of big data include agreements on data availability, data quality,
    access to data, security, responsibility, liability, data ownership, privacy and
    distribution of costs. Three basic forms of network governance can be distinguished
    (Lazzarini et al., 2001): managerial discretion, standardization and mutual adjustment.
    These forms correspond with the three forms of network governance presented by
    Provan and Kenis (2008): lead organization-governed network, network administrative
    organization, and shared participant-governed network. The choice of a particular
    network governance structure aims at mitigating all forms of contractual hazards
    found between the different contracting parties in such a way that transaction
    costs are minimized (Williamson, 1996). When studying hybrid forms of organization
    such as supply chain networks, two main dimensions should be identified: the allocation
    of decision rights, i.e., who has the authority to take strategic decisions within
    the supply chain network, and the inter-organizational mechanisms aiming at rewarding
    desirable behaviour and preventing undesirable behaviour (risk and rewarding mechanisms).
    Despite agreement on the importance of business model to an organization''s success,
    the concept is still fuzzy and vague, and there is little consensus regarding
    its compositional facets. Osterwalder (2004) defines business model as “… a conceptual
    tool that contains a set of elements and their relationships and allows expressing
    a company''s logic of earning money”. It is a description of the value a company
    offers to one or several segments of customers and the architecture of the firm
    and its network of partners for creating, marketing and delivering this value
    and relationship capital, in order to generate profitable and sustainable revenue
    streams.” This definition reflects a so-called firm-centric view of business model.
    Another view on business model is the network-centric business model which builds
    upon value network theories (Al-Debei and Avison, 2010). The value network theories
    consider both financial and non-financial value of business transactions and exchanges.
    Both views are relevant to the network management of Big Data applications. 3.5.
    Network management technology The network management technology includes all computers,
    networks, peripherals, systems software, application packages (application software),
    procedures, technical, information and communication standards (reference information
    models and coding and message standards) etc., that are used and necessary for
    adequate data management in the inter-organizational control of farming processes
    (van der Vorst et al., 2005). Components to be mentioned here encompass: • Data
    resources stored in shared databases and a shared understanding of its content
    (shared data model of the database). • Information systems and services that allow
    us to use and maintain these databases. An information system is used to process
    information necessary to perform useful activities using activities, facilities,
    methods and procedures. • The whole set of formalised coding and message standards
    (both technically and content-wise) with associated procedures for use, connected
    to shared databases, which are necessary to allow seamless and error-free automated
    communication between business partners in a food supply chain network. • The
    necessary technical infrastructure. None of the above can work if we don''t have
    the connected set of computers (workstations of individual associates or people
    employed by or interested in the network and the database, communication and application
    servers and all associated peripherals) that will allow for its usage. In conclusion,
    this framework now provides a coherent set of elements to describe and analyse
    the developments of Big Data in Smart Farming. The results are provided in the
    next section. 4. Results 4.1. Drivers for Big Data in Smart Farming There has
    been a significant trend to consider the application of Big Data techniques and
    methods to agriculture as a major opportunity for application of the technology
    stack, for investment and for the realisation of additional value within the agri-food
    sector (Noyes, 2014, Sun et al., 2013b, Yang, 2014). Big data applications in
    farming are not strictly about primary production, but play a major role in improving
    the efficiency of the entire supply chain and alleviating food security concerns
    (Chen et al., 2014, Esmeijer et al., 2015, Gilpin, 2015a). Currently, big data
    applications discussed in the literature are taking place primarily in Europe
    and North America (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Considering the growing attention
    and keen interest shown in the literature, however, the number of applications
    is expected to grow rapidly in other countries like China (Li et al., 2014, Liu
    et al., 2012). Big data is the focus of in-depth, advanced, game-changing business
    analytics, at a scale and speed that the old approach of copying and cleansing
    all of it into a data warehouse is no longer appropriate (Devlin, 2012). Opportunities
    for Big Data applications in agriculture include benchmarking, sensor deployment
    and analytics, predictive modelling, and using better models to manage crop failure
    risk and to boost feed efficiency in livestock production (Faulkner and Cebul,
    2014, Lesser, 2014). In conclusion, Big Data is to provide predictive insights
    to future outcomes of farming (predictive yield model, predictive feed intake
    model, etc.), drive real-time operational decisions, and reinvent business processes
    for faster, innovative action and game-changing business models (Devlin, 2012).
    Decision-making in the future will be a complex mix of human and computer factors
    (Anonymous, 2014b). Big data is expected to cause changes to both the scope and
    the organization of farming (Poppe et al., 2015). While there are doubts whether
    farmers'' knowledge is about to be replaced by algorithms, Big Data applications
    are likely to change the way farms are operated and managed (Drucker, 2014). Key
    areas of change are real-time forecasting, tracking of physical items, and reinventing
    business processes (Devlin, 2012). Wider uptake of Big Data is likely to change
    both farm structures and the wider food chain in unexplored ways as what happened
    with the wider adoption of tractor and the introduction of pesticides in the 1950s.
    As with many technological innovations changes by Big Data applications in Smart
    Farming are driven by push-pull mechanisms. Pull, because there is a need for
    new technology to achieve certain goals. Push, because new technology enables
    people or organizations to achieve higher or new goals. This will be elaborated
    in the next subsections. 4.1.1. Pull factors From a business perspective, farmers
    are seeking ways to improve profitability and efficiency by on the one hand looking
    for ways to reduce their costs and on the other hand obtaining better prices for
    their product. Therefore they need to take better, more optimal decisions and
    improve management control. While in the past advisory services were based on
    general knowledge that once was derived from research experiments, there is an
    increasing need for information and knowledge that is generated on-farm in its
    local-specific context. It is expected that Big Data technologies help to achieve
    these goals in a better way (Poppe et al., 2015, Sonka, 2015). A specific circumstance
    for farming is the influence of the weather and especially its volatility. Local-specific
    weather and climate data can help decision-making a lot (Lesser, 2014). A general
    driver can be the relief of paper work because of all kind of regulations in agri-food
    production (Poppe et al., 2015). From a public perspective global food security
    is often mentioned as a main driver for further technological advancements (Gilpin,
    2015b, Lesser, 2014, Poppe et al., 2015). Besides, consumers are becoming more
    concerned about food safety and nutritional aspects of food related to health
    and well-being (Tong et al., 2015). In relation to that, Tong et al. (2015) mention
    the need for early warning systems instead of many ex-post analyses that are currently
    being done on historical data. 4.1.2. Push factors A general future development
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) in which all kinds of devices – smart objects
    – are connected and interact with each other through local and global, often wireless
    network infrastructures (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014). Precision agriculture can
    be considered as an exponent of this development and is often mentioned as an
    important driver for Big Data (Lesser, 2014, Poppe et al., 2015). This is expected
    to lead to radical changes in farm management because of access to explicit information
    and decision-making capabilities that were previously not possible, either technically
    or economically (Sonka, 2014). As a consequence, there is a rise of many ag-tech
    companies that pushes this data-driven development further (Lesser, 2014). Wireless
    data transfer technology also permits farmers to access their individual data
    from anywhere – whether they are at the farmhouse or meeting with buyers in Chicago
    – enabling them to make informed decisions about crop yield, harvesting, and how
    best to get their product to market (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Table 2 provides
    an overview and summarizes the push and pull factors that drive the development
    of Big Data and Smart Farming. Table 2. Summary of push and pull factors that

    (Ishii, 2014, Li et al., 2014). The heterogeneity of data concerns for example
    the subject of the data collected (i.e., what is the data about) and the ways
    in which data are generated. Data collected from the field or the farm include
    information on planting, spraying, materials, yields, in-season imagery, soil
    types, weather, and other practices. There are in general three categories of
    data generation (Devlin, 2012, UNECE, 2013): (i) process-mediated (PM), (ii) machine-generated
    (MG) and (iii) human-sourced (HS). PM data, or the traditional business data,
    result from agricultural processes that record and monitor business events of
    interest, such as purchasing inputs, feeding, seeding, applying fertilizer, taking
    an order, etc. PM data are usually highly structured and include transactions,
    reference tables and relationships, as well as the metadata that define their
    context. Traditional business data are the vast majority of what IT managed and
    processed, in both operational and business information systems, usually structured
    and stored in relational database systems. MG data are derived from the vast increasing
    number of sensors and smart machines used to measure and record farming processes;
    this development is currently boosted by what is called the Internet of Things
    (IoT). MG data range from simple sensor records to complex computer logs and are
    typically well-structured. As sensors proliferate and data volumes grow, it is
    becoming an increasingly important component of the farming information stored
    and processed. Its well-structured nature is suitable for computer processing,
    but its size and speed is beyond traditional approaches. For Smart Farming, the
    potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been well-recognized (Faulkner
    and Cebul, 2014, Holmes, 2014). Drones with infrared cameras, GPS technology,
    are transforming agriculture with their support for better decision making, risk
    management (Anonymous, 2014c). In livestock farming, smart dairy farms are replacing
    labour with robots in activities like feeding cows, cleaning the barn, and milking
    the cows (Grobart, 2012). On arable farms, precision technology is increasingly
    used for managing information about each plant in the field (Vogt, 2013). With
    these new technologies data is not in traditional tables only, but can also appear
    in other formats like sounds or images (Sonka, 2015). In the meantime several
    advanced data analysis techniques have been developed that trigger the use of
    data in images or other formats (Lesser, 2014, Noyes, 2014). HM data is the record
    of human experiences, previously recorded in books and works of art, and later
    in photographs, audio and video. Human-sourced information is now almost entirely
    digitized and stored everywhere from personal computers to social networks. HM
    data are usually loosely structured and often ungoverned. In the context of Big
    Data and Smart Farming, human-sourced data have rarely been discussed except in
    relation to the marketing aspects (Verhoosel et al., 2016). Limited capacity with
    regard to the collection of relevant social media data and semantic integration
    of these data from a diversity of sources is considered to be a major challenge
    (Bennett, 2015). Table 3 provides an overview of current Big Data applications
    in relation to different elements of Smart Farming in key farming sectors. Table

    2013) Satellite data, (European Space Agency, 2016) From the business perspective,
    the main data products along the Big Data value chain are (predictive) analytics
    that provide decision support to business processes at various levels. The use
    or analysis of sensor data or similar data must somehow fit into existing or reinvented
    business processes. Integration of data from a variety of sources, both traditional
    and new, with multiple tools, is the first prerequisite. 4.2.2. Farm management
    As Big Data observers point out: big or small, Big Data is still data (Devlin,
    2012). It must be managed and analysed to extract its full value. Developments
    in wireless networks, IoT, and cloud computing are essentially only means to obtain
    data and generate Big Data. The ultimate use of Big Data is to obtain the information
    or intelligence embodied or enabled by Big Data. Agricultural Big Data will have
    no real value without Big Data analytics (Sun et al., 2013b). To obtain Big Data
    analytics, data from different sources need to be integrated into ‘lagoons of
    data’. In this process, data quality issues are likely to arise due to errors
    and duplications in data. As shown in Fig. 4, a series of operations on the raw
    data may be necessary to ensure the quality of data. Download : Download high-res
    image (170KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. The flowchart of intelligent
    processing of agricultural Big Data. (Source: Li et al., 2014) Since the advent
    of large-scale data collections or warehouses, the so-called data rich, information
    poor (DRIP) problems have been pervasive. The DRIP conundrum has been mitigated
    by the Big Data approach which has unleashed information in a manner that can
    support informed - yet, not necessarily defensible or valid - decisions or choices.
    Thus, by somewhat overcoming data quality issues with data quantity, data access
    restrictions with on-demand cloud computing, causative analysis with correlative
    data analytics, and model-driven with evidence-driven applications (Tien, 2013).
    Big data on its own can offer ‘a-ha’ insights, but it can only reliably deliver
    long-term business advantage when fully integrated with traditional data management
    and governance processes (Devlin, 2012). Big Data processing depends on traditional,
    process-mediated data and metadata to create the context and consistency needed
    for full, meaningful use. The results of Big Data processing must be fed back
    into traditional business processes to enable change and evolution of the business.
    4.2.3. Data chain As often discussed in the literature, a wide range of issues
    need to be addressed for big data applications. Both technical and governance
    issues can arise in different stages of the data chain, where governance challenges
    become increasingly dominant at the later stages of the data chain. Table 4 summarizes
    the state-of-the-art features of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and the
    key issues corresponding to each stage of the Big Data chain that were found in
    literature. At the initial stages, technical issues concerning data formats, hardware,
    and information standards may influence the availability of big data for further
    analysis. At the later stages, governance issues such as achieving agreements
    on responsibilities and liabilities become more challenging for business processes.

    by Big Data and Smart Farming, we seek to understand the stakeholder network around
    the farm. The literature suggests major shifts in roles and power relations among
    different players in existing agri-food chains. We observed the changing roles
    of old and new software suppliers in relation to Big Data and farming and emerging
    landscape of data-driven initiatives with prominent role of big tech and data
    companies like Google and IBM. In Fig. 5, the current landscape of data-driven
    initiatives is visualized. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The landscape of the Big Data network with
    business players. The stakeholder networks exhibits a high degree of dynamics
    with new players taking over the roles played by other players and the incumbents
    assuming new roles in relation to agricultural Big Data. As opportunities for
    Big Data have surfaced in the agribusiness sector, big agriculture companies such
    as Monsanto and John Deere have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technologies
    that use detailed data on soil type, seed variety, and weather to help farmers
    cut costs and increase yields (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014). Other players include
    various accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and corporate venture
    funds (Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, Bayer, DOW etc.) (Lane, 2015). Monsanto has
    been pushing big-data analytics across all its business lines, from climate prediction
    to genetic engineering. It is trying to persuade more farmers to adopt its cloud
    services. Monsanto says farmers benefit most when they allow the company to analyse
    their data - along with that of other farmers - to help them find the best solutions
    for each patch of land (Guild, 2014). While corporates are very much engaged with
    Big Data and agriculture, start-ups are at the heart of action, providing solutions
    across the value chain, from infrastructure and sensors all the way down to software
    that manages the many streams of data from across the farm. As the ag-tech space
    heats up, an increasing number of small tech start-ups are launching products
    giving their bigger counterparts a run for their money. In the USA, start-ups
    like FarmLogs (Guild, 2014), FarmLink (Hardy, 2014) and 640 Labs challenge agribusiness
    giants like Monsanto, Deere, DuPont Pioneer (Plume, 2014). One observes a swarm
    of data-service start-ups such as FarmBot (an integrated open-source precision
    agriculture system) and Climate Corporation. Their products are powered by many
    of the same data sources, particularly those that are freely available such as
    from weather services and Google Maps. They can also access data gathered by farm
    machines and transferred wirelessly to the cloud. Traditional agri-IT firms such
    as NEC and Dacom are active with a precision farming trial in Romania using environmental
    sensors and Big Data analytics software to maximize yields (NEC, 2014). Venture
    capital firms are now keen on investing in agriculture technology companies such
    as Blue River Technology, a business focusing on the use of computer vision and
    robotics in agriculture (Royse, 2014). The new players to Smart Farming are tech
    companies that were traditionally not active in agriculture. For example, Japanese
    technology firms such as Fujitsu are helping farmers with their cloud based farming
    systems (Anonymous, 2014c). Fujitsu collects data (rainfall, humidity, soil temperatures)
    from a network of cameras and sensors across the country to help farmers in Japan
    better manage its crops and expenses (Carlson, 2012). Data processing specialists
    are likely to become partners of producers as Big Data delivers on its promise
    to fundamentally change the competitiveness of producers. Beside business players
    such as corporates and start-ups, there are many public institutions (e.g., universities,
    USDA, the American Farm Bureau Federation, GODAN) that are actively influencing
    Big Data applications in farming through their advocacy on open data and data-driven
    innovation or their emphasis on governance issues concerning data ownership and
    privacy issues. Well-known examples are the Big Data Coalition, Open Agriculture
    Data Alliance (OADA) and AgGateway. Public institutions like the USDA, for example,
    want to harness the power of agricultural data points created by connected farming
    equipment, drones, and even satellites to enable precision agriculture for policy
    objectives like food security and sustainability. Precision farming is considered
    to be the “holy grail” because it is the means by which the food supply and demand
    imbalance will be solved. To achieve that precision, farmers need a lot of data
    to inform their planting strategies. That is why USDA is investing in big, open
    data projects. It is expected that open data and Big Data will be combined together
    to provide farmers and consumers just the right kind of information to make the
    best decisions (Semantic Community, 2015). 4.4. Network management 4.4.1. Organization
    Data ownership is an important issue in discussions on the governance of agricultural
    Big Data generated by smart machinery such as tractors from John Deere (Burrus,
    2014). In particular, value and ownership of precision agricultural data have
    received much attention in business media (Haire, 2014). It has become a common
    practice to sign Big Data agreements on ownership and control data between farmers
    and agriculture technology providers (Anonymous, 2014a). Such agreements address
    questions such as: How can farmers make use of Big Data? Where does the data come
    from? How much data can we collect? Where is it stored? How do we make use of
    it? Who owns this data? Which companies are involved in data processing? There
    is also a growing number of initiatives to address or ease privacy and security
    concerns. For example, the Big Data Coalition, a coalition of major farm organizations
    and agricultural technology providers in the USA, has set principles on data ownership,
    data collection, notice, third-party access and use, transparency and consistency,
    choice, portability, data availability, market speculation, liability and security
    safeguards (Haire, 2014). And AgGateway, a non-profit organization with more than
    200 member companies in the USA, have drawn a white paper that presents ways to
    incorporate data privacy and standards (AgGateway, 2014). It provides users of
    farm data and their customers with issues to consider when establishing policies,
    procedures, and agreements on using that data instead of setting principles and
    privacy norms. The ‘Ownership Principle’ of the Big Data Coalition states that
    “We believe farmers own information generated on their farming operations. However,
    it is the responsibility of the farmer to agree upon data use and sharing with
    the other stakeholders (...).” While having concerns about data ownership, farmers
    also see how much companies are investing in Big Data. In 2013, Monsanto paid
    nearly 1 billion US dollars to acquire The Climate Corporation, and more industry
    consolidation is expected. Farmers want to make sure they reap the profits from
    Big Data, too. Such change of thinking may lead to new business models that allow
    shared harvesting of value from data. Big data applications in Smart Farming will
    potentially raise many power-related issues (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014). There
    might be companies emerging that gain much power because they get all the data.
    In the agri-food chain these could be input suppliers or commodity traders, leading
    to a further power shift in market positions (Lesser, 2014). This power shift
    can also lead to potential abuses of data e.g. by the GMO lobby or agricultural
    commodity markets or manipulation of companies (Noyes, 2014). Initially, these
    threats might not be obvious because for many applications small start-up companies
    with hardly any power are involved. However, it is a common business practice
    that these are acquired by bigger companies if they are successful and in this
    way the data still gets concentrated in the hands of one big player (Lesser, 2014).
    Gilpin (2015b), for example, concluded that Big Data is both a huge opportunity
    as a potential threat for farmers. 4.4.2. Technology To make Big Data applications
    for Smart Farming work, an appropriate technological infrastructure is essential.
    Although we could not find much information about used infrastructures in literature
    it can be expected that the applications from the AgTech and AgBusiness companies
    in Fig. 5 are based on their existing infrastructure that is usually supplied
    by large software vendors. This has resulted in several proprietary platforms
    such as AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deere''s FarmSight or Monsanto''s FieldScripts.
    Initially these platforms were quite closed and difficult to connect to by other
    third parties. However, they increasingly realize to be part of a system of systems
    (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014) resulting in more open platforms in which data is
    accessible through open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The tech- and
    data start-ups mainly rely on open standards (e.g. ISOBUS) through which they
    are able to combine different datasets. Moreover, Farmobile recently introduced
    a piece of hardware, the passive uplink communicator (PUC), which captures all
    machine data into a database that can be transmitted wirelessly (Young, 2016).
    In North America, several initiatives are undertaken to open up data transfer
    between several platforms and devices. The ISOBlue project facilitates data acquisition
    through the development of and open-source hardware platform and software libraries
    to forward ISOBUS messages to the cloud and develop applications for Android smartphones
    (Layton et al., 2014). The Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK) endeavours to provide a specialized
    Farm Management Information System incorporating low-cost, widely available mobile
    computing technologies, internet-based cloud storage services, and user-centred
    design principles (Welte et al., 2013). One of the internet-based cloud storage
    services that is candidate in the OpenATK is Trello, which is also advocated by
    Ault et al. (2013). They emphasize the capability to share data records easily
    between several workers within the farm or stakeholders outside the farm and the
    guarantee of long-term ownership of farmer''s data. In Europe, much work to realize
    an open infrastructure for data exchange and collaboration was done within the
    Future Internet programme. The focus of this programme was to realize a set of
    Generic Enablers (GEs) for e.g. cloud hosting, data and context management services,
    IoT services, security and Big Data Analysis which are common to all Future Internet
    applications for all kind of different sectors, called FIWARE (Wolfert et al.,
    2014). The SmartAgriFood proposed a conceptual architecture for Future Internet
    applications for the agri-food domain based on these FIWARE GEs (Kaloxylos et
    al., 2012, Kaloxylos et al., 2014). The FIspace project implemented this architecture
    into a real platform for business collaboration which is visualized in Fig. 6
    (Barmpounakis et al., 2015, Wolfert et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res
    image (167KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. A high-level picture
    of the FIspace architecture based on FIWARE GEs. Further explanation in text.
    FIspace uses FIWARE Generic Enablers (GEs) but has two particular extensions for
    business collaboration: the App Store and the Real-Time B2B collaboration core.
    These key components are connected with several other modules to enable system
    integration (e.g. with IoT), to ensure Security, Privacy and Trust in business
    collaboration and an Operating Environment and Software Development Kit to support
    an ‘ecosystem’ in which Apps for the FIspace store can be developed. The FIspace
    platform will be approachable through various type of front-ends (e.g. web or
    smartphone), but also direct M2M communication is possible. Because all mentioned
    open platforms are result from recent projects, their challenge is still how they
    could be broadly adopted. For the FIspace platform, a first attempt was made in
    the FIWARE accelerator programme1 in which several hundreds of start-ups were
    funded to develop apps and services and also received business support. Some of
    them were already successful in receiving further funding from private investors,
    but it is too early to determine the final success rate of this programme. 4.5.
    Challenges The challenges for Big Data and Smart Farming found in literature can
    be broadly classified into technical and organizational ones of which the latter
    category is considered the most important (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014, Sonka, 2015).
    Moreover, most technical challenges will be solved if enough business opportunities
    for Big Data in Smart Farming can be created, so there needs to be a clear return
    on investment (Lesser, 2014). On the revenue side, there is a challenge to make
    solutions affordable for farmers, especially for those in developing countries
    (Kshetri, 2014). If there will be more users of Big Data applications it will
    lead in its turn to more valuable data, often referred to as the reciprocal value
    of Big Data (Van ''t Spijker, 2014). This is a very important feature that needs
    to be carefully implemented in companies'' strategies. On the costs side, the
    challenge is to automate data acquisition in such a way that there are virtually
    no costs (Sonka, 2015). Because on-farm data will generally remain in the hands
    of individual companies, investments are needed in a common pool infrastructure
    to transfer and integrate data and finally make applications out of it. Poppe
    et al. (2015) refer to this as Agricultural Business Collaboration and Data Exchange
    Facilities (ABCDEFs). An important question concerning these ABCDEFs is if these
    will be closed, proprietary systems such as currently Monsanto''s FieldScripts
    or if these will be more open as proposed by e.g. the OpenATK or the FIspace platform.
    Finally, another business-related challenge of Big Data is how the potential of
    information across food systems can be utilized (Sonka, 2015). One of the biggest
    challenges of Big Data governance is probably how to ensure privacy and security
    (Lesser, 2014, Orts and Spigonardo, 2014, Sonka, 2014, Van ''t Spijker, 2014).
    Currently this is sometimes inhibiting developments when data are in silos, guarded
    by employees or companies because of this issue. They are afraid that data fall
    into the wrong hands (e.g. of competitors) (Gilpin, 2015b). Hence privileged access
    to Big Data and building trust with farmers should be a starting point in developing
    applications (Van ''t Spijker, 2014). Therefore new organizational linkages and
    modes of collaboration need to be formed in the agri-food chain (Sonka, 2014).
    In other words, it means the ability to quickly access the correct data sources
    to evaluate key performance/core processes and outcome indicators in building
    successful growth strategies (Yang, 2014). All aforementioned challenges make
    that the current amounts of farm data is currently underutilized (Bennett, 2015).
    Another problem is that the availability and quality of the data is often poor
    and needs to be ensured before you can make use of it (Lesser, 2014, Orts and
    Spigonardo, 2014). A lack of integration is also reported as an important problem
    (Yang, 2014). Anonymization of data, so that it cannot be traced back to individual
    companies can also be a problem sometimes (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014). There are
    also attempts to include more open, governmental data (cf. the GODAN initiative),
    but a problem can be that the underlying systems were never designed for that
    or they contain many inconsistent, incompatible data (Orts and Spigonardo, 2014).
    5. Conclusions and recommendations In this paper a literature review on Big Data
    applications in Smart Farming was conducted. In Section 2 it was concluded that
    currently there are not many references in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
    Therefore, a reliable, quantitative analysis was not possible. Furthermore, findings
    from grey literature may lack scientific rigor as can be expected from peer-reviewed
    journal articles. However, as articles from grey literature are publicly available,
    they can be seen as being subject to public scrutiny and therefore reasonably
    reliable. As such, we consider that the knowledge base was enriched by articles
    from grey literature. Besides, much effort was put into developing a framework
    for analysis that can be used for future reviews with a more quantitative approach.
    Based on the findings in this paper several conclusions can be drawn on the state-of-the-art
    of Big Data applications in Smart Farming. First of all, Big Data in Smart Farming
    is still in an early development stage. This is based on the fact there are only
    limited scientific publications available on this topic and much information had
    to be derived from ‘grey literature’. The applications discussed are mainly from
    Europe and Northern America, with a growing number of applications expected from
    other countries as well. Considering the scope of the review, no geographic analysis
    was performed in this study. Further conclusions, drawn as answers to the research
    questions we formulated in the Introduction, are elaborated below. What role does
    Big Data play in Smart Farming? Big Data is changing the scope and organization
    of farming through a pull-push mechanism. Global issues such as food security
    and safety, sustainability and as a result efficiency improvement are tried to
    be addressed by Big Data applications. These issues make that the scope of Big
    Data applications extends far beyond farming alone, but covers the entire supply
    chain. The Internet of Things development, wirelessly connecting all kind of objects
    and devices in farming and the supply chain, is producing many new data that are
    real-time accessible. This applies to all stages in the cyber-physical management
    cycle (Fig. 1). Operations and transactions are most important sources of process-mediated
    data. Sensors and robots producing also non-traditional data such as images and
    videos provide many machine-generated data. Social media is an important source
    for human-sourced data. These big amounts of data provide access to explicit information
    and decision-making capabilities at a level that was not possible before. Analytics
    is key success factor to create value out of these data. Many new and innovative
    start-up companies are eager to sell and deploy all kind of applications to farmers
    of which the most important ones are related to sensor deployment, benchmarking,
    predictive modelling and risk management. What stakeholders are involved and how
    are they organized? Referring to Fig. 5, there are first of all the traditional
    players in agriculture such as input suppliers and technology suppliers for which
    there is a clear move towards Big Data as their most important business model.
    Most of them are pushing their own platforms and solutions to farmers, which are
    often proprietary and rather closed environments although a tendency towards more
    openness is observed. This is stimulated by farmers - organized in cooperatives
    or coalitions - that are concerned about data privacy and security and also want
    to create value with their own data or at least want to benefit from Big Data
    solutions. Beside the traditional players we see that Big Data is also attracting
    many new entrants which are often start-ups supported by either large private
    investors or large ICT or non-agricultural tech companies. Also public institutions
    aim to open up public data that can be combined with private data. These developments
    raise issues around data ownership, value of data and privacy and security. The
    architecture and infrastructure of Big Data solutions are also significantly determining
    how stakeholder networks are organized. On the one hand there is a tendency towards
    closed, proprietary systems and on the other hand towards more open systems based
    on open source, standards and interfaces. Further development of Big Data applications
    may therefore likely result in two extremes of supply chain scenarios: one with
    further integration of the supply chain in which farmers become franchisers; another
    in which farmers are empowered by Big Data and open collaboration and can easily
    switch between suppliers, share data with government and participate in short
    supply chains rather than integrated long supply chains. In reality, the situation
    will be a continuum between these two extremes differentiated by crop, commodity,
    market structure, etc. What are the expected changes that are caused by Big Data
    developments? From this review it can be concluded that Big Data will cause major
    changes in scope and organization of Smart Farming. Business analytics at a scale
    and speed that was never seen before will be a real game changer, continuously
    reinventing new business models. Referring to Fig. 1, it can be expected that
    farm management and operations will drastically change by access to real-time
    data, real-time forecasting and tracking of physical items and in combination
    with IoT developments in further automation and autonomous operation of the farm.
    Taking also the previous research question into account, it is already visible
    that Big Data will also cause major shifts in power relationships between the
    different players in the Big Data farming stakeholder network. The current development
    stage does however not reveal yet towards which main scenario Smart Farming will
    be developed. What challenges need to be addressed in relation to the previous
    questions? A long list of key issues was already provided in Table 4, but the
    most important ones are • Data-ownership and related privacy and security issues
    – these issues have to be properly addressed, but when this is applied too strictly
    it can also slow down innovations; • Data quality – which has always been a key
    issue in farm management information systems, but is more challenging with big,
    real-time data; • Intelligent processing and analytics – for Big Data this is
    also more challenging because of the large amount of often unstructured, heterogeneous
    data which requires a smart interplay between skilled data scientists and domain
    experts; • Sustainable integration of Big Data sources – integration of many different
    data sources is challenging but because this is crucial for your business model
    this has to be done in a sustainable manner; • Business models that are attractive
    enough for solution providers but that also enable a fair share between the different
    stakeholders; • Openness of platforms that will accelerate solution development
    and innovation in general but also empower farmers in their position in supply
    chains. The framework for analysis was developed from a chain network perspective
    with specific attention to network management between the stakeholders that are
    involved. In future research it could also be valuable to look at this subject
    from a wider innovation perspective (Busse et al., 2015, Klerkx et al., 2010,
    Lamprinopoulou et al., 2014). The same holds for ethical aspects of an innovation
    such as Big Data that could be addressed in future research (Carolan, 2016, Driessen
    and Heutinck, 2015, Wigboldus et al., 2016). The promise of Big Data in agriculture
    is alluring, but the challenges above have to be addressed for increased uptake
    of Big Data applications. Although there are certainly technical issues to be
    resolved we recommend to focus first on the governance issues that were identified
    and design suitable business models because these are currently the most inhibiting
    factors. References AgGateway, 2014 AgGateway Data privacy and use white paper

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\
    \ interoperability; security and\nprivacy; reliability; scalability\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [1],\
    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n2 of 18\n\
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\
    \ reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability\n\
    in terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;\
    \ real-time\ndata processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection\
    \ of infrastructure\nand smart farming assets (privacy and security); and ﬁnally,\
    \ compliance with policies and\nregulation. The proposed approach facilitates\
    \ cooperation among different parties in smart\nfarming ecosystems and enables\
    \ these actors to make the most use of available data sources.\nThe rest of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data\nprocessing\
    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\
    \ processing functions can be assigned to both layers.\nThe data processing layer\
    \ components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical\nmodeling, statistical\
    \ methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge\nfrom farm\
    \ data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to\
    \ make\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n4 of 18\nautomated decisions with limited human\
    \ involvement. Machine learning can perform\nrapid optimizations, classiﬁcations\
    \ [30], predictions, and recommendations and add value\nto the entire system [31].\
    \ For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes machine\nlearning\
    \ for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors the cows to detect\n\
    disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at milking stations on dairy\
    \ farms.\nAs another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an open-source analytic platform\
    \ that uses machine\nlearning to categorize iceberg lettuces to improve the actual\
    \ yield and crop marketability\nbefore harvesting [32]. Model deployment in the\
    \ context of machine learning refers to\nthe application of generalizing a model\
    \ to predict new items in the system. Prediction is\naccording to estimating the\
    \ outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.\nFor example,\
    \ the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest time\n\
    and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction about\
    \ the future\nusing time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming\
    \ is weather forecasting\nusing temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].\n\

    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\
    \ also the need to set\nstandards for data-sharing practices and to apply policies\
    \ to determine accountability and\npenalties in the case of possible disputes.\
    \ Other regulations related to food safety, supply\nchain management, disease\
    \ monitoring, and other applications can also impact agriculture\ndata management\
    \ and processing. These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new\nand emerging\
    \ agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded\ninto\
    \ technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability purposes.\nAgriculture\

    \ consideration of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for\
    \ smart farming data processing. These\nrequirements enable seamless integration\
    \ of data, system, and processes with the end-user\nin mind. They include interoperability\

    \ can be \nembedded into technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability\

    \ of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for smart farming\

    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n13 of 18\nfarming applications, including trust management [100,101],\
    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    Abstract\nAccording to the United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals are framed\
    \ for improving rural health, hunger, poverty \nissues, environmental conditions,\
    \ and illiteracy globally. With the upcoming technology, there have been many\
    \ advances \nin the lifestyle of people all around the world. Comparatively, more\
    \ emphasis has been given to the development of urban \nareas than rural. The\
    \ sustainable development of a country depends on the growth of its rural areas.\
    \ Countless technologi-\ncal and theoretical models, projects, and frameworks\
    \ have been proposed and implemented to help overcome sundry issues \nand challenges\
    \ faced by rural people in quotidian life. New technological methods are deemed\
    \ to be the future of livability, \ntherefore; a technologically advanced solution\
    \ for sustainable rural development is called for. Blockchain Technology is the\
    \ \nnext step for innovation and development and it has far many applications\
    \ in sustainable rural development that are yet to \nbe discovered. The objective\
    \ of this paper is to explicitly review research conducted in rural development\
    \ to fill the undone \nwork in the future with better research ideas, to make\
    \ rural areas a livable and advanced place while also maintaining their \nintegrity\
    \ leading to sustainable development. To conduct such a review, a systematic research\
    \ methodology is applied follow-\ning regulations in the conduction of standardized\
    \ but explorative analysis. Within the timeline of 2010–2021, 112 papers are \n\
    carefully selected to perform the systematic review. This review will provide\
    \ a comprehensible as well as concise research \ncompendium for all applications\
    \ proposed, implemented, and possible in the future to realize the concept of\
    \ smart villages \nfor the development of rural areas using blockchain technology.\n\

    \ of a country partly depends on how well \nconnected are its rural areas to the\
    \ global chain and how \ntechnologically advanced they are. Rural areas as we\
    \ know \nof are geographical locations sited outside town or cities \nwith fewer\
    \ populations. Essentially, we also know it as a \nplace unprivileged of vital\
    \ necessities, stricken by poverty \n[1], and unemployment. For many years, rural\
    \ areas have \nbeen developing consecutively in Technology, Education, \nHousing,\
    \ Governance, Human rights. Accordingly, the \nworld’s rural population has dropped\
    \ from 66.389 percent \nin 1960–44.286 [2] percent in 2019 due to various trans-\n\
    formations. Years ago, people in rural areas were deprived \nof necessities such\
    \ as water, electricity, and education. \nEven getting a reliable source of electricity\
    \ was a strenuous \neffort. Moreover, female rights, reliable healthcare and sub-\n\
    sequently securing a job were more of a dream. According \nto the United Nations,\
    \ there can be seen a steady drop in \nthe percentage of people residing in rural\
    \ areas from 1960 \nto 2019 [3]. What was the core reason behind it? A general\
    \ \nexample of the reason can be migration, rural decline, demo-\ngraphic qualities,\
    \ natural disasters, and infrastructure: trans-\nportation or socio-economic.\
    \ These can further be exploited \ninto many explanations as to what leads to\
    \ those choices. \nRural–Urban migration itself directs catastrophic changes \n\
    in the environment and economy. Rural Decline is another \nconsequence of migration\
    \ that drains the area of services, \nbusinesses, and social capital forcing the\
    \ development of the \nFig. 1  Issues in rural areas\n2419\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ or probably diminish [4]. Even then, almost \nhalf of the world’s population\
    \ comes under rural areas and it \nconsists of many more issues than resolvable.\n\
    1.1  Background\nThis section explores the interdependent backdrops of the \n\
    rural area and a feasible solution through the concept of \nsmart villages. Sustainable\
    \ development goals with respect \nto Blockchain Technology are discussed in sub-Sect. 1.1.2\
    \ \nand a brief introduction on Blockchain Technology and \ndevelopment techniques\
    \ are mentioned in sub-Sect. 1.1.3.\n1.1.1  Rural Development\nSustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs) were framed for \nimproving rural health, hunger, poverty issues,\
    \ environ-\nmental conditions, and illiteracy globally. The present situ-\nation\
    \ of rural areas brings us to a list of issues (Fig. 1) that \ncan further promote\
    \ the eradication of rural areas from the \nglobal chain if not technologically.\
    \ Beginning with pov-\nerty which has been an issue unresolved regardless of the\
    \ \nvarious monetary schemes provided by the government \ndrives the young generation\
    \ out of the community to find \njobs to sustain daily needs. Many of them fail\
    \ to finish \neven high school, which leads to securing menial jobs in \nurban\
    \ regions. This brings us to the second issue in the \nrural community, illiteracy\
    \ [5]. Education that plays a vital \nrole in the overall development of humans,\
    \ as well as the \ncommunity, is often disregarded to fulfill contemporary \n\
    requirements such as money. In many cases, the parents \nexploit their children\
    \ into working on the farm or small \nfamily businesses.\nTypical issues in a\
    \ rural school can be enumerated as \nteacher’s absenteeism, unhygienic school\
    \ premises, and dis-\ntant schools, technologically backward, absence of school\
    \ \nrecords, inexperienced teachers, and teachers with false \ndegrees. Those\
    \ who get themselves educated, consider it \nbetter to get a job in urban areas\
    \ because of job opportunities \nand better pay which is at times difficult since\
    \ most villages \nlack communication between employees and job availability \n\
    [6]. Basic hygiene and pollution are other issues in rural \nareas that deplete\
    \ life expectancy and give birth to numer-\nous diseases. Many rural communities\
    \ do not have proper \nsanitation facilities, dumping grounds, or recycling plants.\
    \ \nNot having the basic facilities drives people into a lack of \npersonal hygiene\
    \ such as bathing, washing, and cleanliness \n[7]. Pollution of land and soil\
    \ is prevalent due to unhealthy \nsanitary practices. Hundreds of people still\
    \ live without \nwashing their hands leading to diarrhea, cholera, and the \n\
    death of children [8]. Acknowledging the fact that medical \npractitioners, physicians\
    \ are scarce on top of that reaching \na nearby multispecialty hospital takes\
    \ a lot of time [9]. The \nprimary activity of rural people is said to be agriculture.\
    \ \nIt is considered to be the basic source of income for the \ndwellers. Farmers\
    \ in many areas remain uninformed about \nthe recent advancements in agro-technologies.\
    \ The core \nreason for this incomprehension is the lack of broadband \nconnection\
    \ and incentives. Even though the Government \nprovides various monetary as well\
    \ as agricultural schemes, \nmore than half of the farmers fail to enroll in one\
    \ [10]. In \naddition to that from the consumer’s point, there is a whole \nheap\
    \ of issues relating to the certification of quality produce, \nimproper monitoring\
    \ of crops, traceability of farm produce, \nand unsustainable agro-activities.\
    \ Besides, the involvement \nof middlemen leaves the farmers with the minimal\
    \ price \nof agricultural produce [11]. Further, given the aspects of \ndaily\
    \ needs, approximately 940 million [12] people around \nthe world live without\
    \ access to electricity, most of which \nbelong to rural areas. In a generation\
    \ where electricity is \nthe basic need in every household, industry, medical\
    \ center \nwithout which the whole institution of Earth would come \nto a halt,\
    \ there are still people who do their daily activi-\nties without it [8, 9]. About\
    \ 1.7 billion [13] people in the \nworld are still unbanked. The banking facility\
    \ is essential \nfor financial assistance especially much needed to financially\
    \ \nexcluded dwellers of the rural community. However, due \nto unreachable banking\
    \ locations, time-consuming Banking \nprocesses, and in many cases lacking identity\
    \ proof con-\nstrains the adults from applying for a bank account further \nreducing\
    \ the chances of obtaining a loan or funding from \ngovernment schemes [14].\n\
    The concept of a smart village [15] is to develop a rural \narea using technology\
    \ as a medium. The biggest problems \nin rural areas are financial exclusion,\
    \ poverty, hygiene, and \neducation [16]. All the issues are interconnected and\
    \ co-\ndependent, such as due to poverty, children in rural areas fail \nto get\
    \ an education [17]. Due to illiteracy, the villagers do \nnot come to know about\
    \ various financial schemes. People \nseem to care very less about hygiene. Not\
    \ only the waste \nis disposed of incorrectly, but it is also burnt giving rise\
    \ to \nenvironmental pollution. Most of the time people do not \nfind encouragement\
    \ to learn how to properly discard waste \nmaterial, to get educated, or find\
    \ a solution to their financial \nproblems [18].\n1.1.2  Sustainable Development\
    \ and Blockchain\nThe development of an economically backward area without \n\
    jeopardizing the natural assets or future necessities is termed \nsustainable\
    \ development. According to the United Nations, \nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDG) [19] were adopted \nin 2015 for improving rural health, hunger, poverty\
    \ issues, \nenvironmental conditions, and illiteracy globally (Fig. 2). \nThe\
    \ sustainable development goals that balance the socio-\neconomic and environmental\
    \ factors are:\n2420\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nFor rural development, World\

    \ Development Goals \n(SG’s) in rural areas can be elucidated in terms of different\
    \ \nregions. As per the research [22], in Ukraine, control over \nthe large businesses\
    \ and their impact over the agribusiness \nstructures in addition to shrinking\
    \ the number of farms, \njeopardizing rural population, poverty, and fewer efforts\
    \ in \nsocial cohesion improvements or remote development are \nthe principal\
    \ challenges of achieving SDG.\nSimilarly, as per the methodology applied by the\
    \ author in \n[23], the major challenges faced by Romania over achieving \nSDG\
    \ are the Socio economic discrepancy among the rural \ndwellers’ lives as well\
    \ as the Environmental incongruity.\nA few of the Sustainable Development challenges\
    \ faced \nby the Iranian Rural communities as per the authors [24] \nare economic\
    \ setbacks, improper management, and under-\nplanned developments, environmental\
    \ factors, social con-\ncerns, and infrastructural challenges were determined.\
    \ \nOverall implications of the studies provide us with a con-\ncise picture of\
    \ significant challenges of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment goals in rural\
    \ areas.\nSustainability and blockchain both are the call for the \nfuture to\
    \ reduce cost, increase productivity, improving \nhealth, better environmental\
    \ state, and availability of food, \nwater, and sanitation. Blockchain holds the\
    \ ability for long-\nterm and inclusive progress in sustainable development and\
    \ \nto achieve SDGs.\n1.1.3  Blockchain Technology\nIn 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto\
    \ [25] (pseudonym) proposed \nBitcoin, its expansion was doubted. The rise of\
    \ Blockchain \nwas such unforeseen that some enthusiasts asserted it as the \n\
    biggest invention since the Internet [26]. Although W Scott \nStornetta and Stuart\
    \ Haber described the first cryptographi-\ncally secured chain of blocks in 1991,\
    \ it wasn’t until 2009 \nthat Blockchain was implemented as the public ledger\
    \ for \nbitcoin transactions by Nakamoto. For a substantial amount \nof time,\
    \ Blockchain technology was only preferred for a \ncryptocurrency (Fig. 3). However,\
    \ after the introduction of \nscripting language into the blocks by Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ \nto work as bonds, which are now known as Smart Contracts \nthe inventory of\
    \ applications widely opened. In his paper \nNakamoto proposed to create a peer-to-peer\
    \ form of elec-\ntronic cash that did not require a financial institution as an\
    \ \nintermediary and would be transferred directly between \none party and another.\
    \ He improved the double-spending \nFig. 2  Sustainable development \ngoals\n\

    \ and hashing them onto the ongoing chain \nof hash-based proof-of-work which\
    \ changed the proof-of-\nwork if tampered with hence forming an immutable record.\n\
    Blockchain, even though it uses pseudonyms as account \nidentifiers, has four\
    \ key trust characteristics that eliminate \nthe need for third-party authenticators.\
    \ Firstly, a ledger in \nwhich after successful verification and authentication\
    \ the \ntransaction details are stored. Secondly, it is Secure since \nits transactions\
    \ are time-stamped and hashed to the previ-\nous blocks; it makes the blockchain\
    \ cryptographically secure \n(Fig. 4). Thirdly, the shared characteristic of involving\
    \ mul-\ntiple users provides transparency amongst all participants \nin the distributed\
    \ ledger. Lastly, its property of being dis-\ntributed eliminates operational\
    \ inefficiencies, provides more \nsecurity as the more the number of nodes the\
    \ more resilient \nit is towards attacks [27].\nThe complexity of the working\
    \ of blockchain can be \nsimplified by exploring the components that make up its\
    \ \narchitecture [28]. The main components can be enumer-\nated as Node, Cryptographic\
    \ hash functions, Transactions, \nAsymmetric-key cryptography, Ledgers, Blocks,\
    \ Miners, \nand Consensus (Fig. 5).\nNode: A device possibly a computer forming\
    \ the structure \nof a blockchain. A node is where the blockchain exists. Cop-\n\
    ies, as well as original records of the blockchain, are stored \nin a node. Classified\
    \ as Full node and Light nodes, where \nFull node is a server in a decentralized\
    \ network that contains \nthe Block chain’s block history, and Light nodes are\
    \ used for \nsimple payment verification such as a wallet that queries the \n\
    current status of a block.\nLedgers: A decentralized blockchain uses a ledger\
    \ for \nrecord-keeping. As it is decentralized, it keeps many copies \nof the\
    \ transaction including providing a copy to each user \nof their transaction.\n\
    Blocks: A block resembles a page in a record book \n(ledger). The first block\
    \ is called the generic block. A block \ncomprises a block header and block data\
    \ where the block \nheader consists of the history of the blockchain (previous\
    \ \nhash value, timestamp, size of the block, and nonce) and \nminers perform\
    \ hashing to validate the block, and block data \nkeeps the record of recent transactions\
    \ that are yet to enter \nthe blocks.\nCryptographic hash functions: A digest\
    \ or an algorithm \nthat takes up an arbitrary amount of data and produces a \n\
    hash value or hash which is an output of fixed size. It elimi-\nnates the use\
    \ of a password, instead uses enciphered text that \nprovides more security from\
    \ attackers.\nTransactions: A transaction is what the components work \nabout.\
    \ When two parties interact in blockchain, a transaction \ntakes place. Authorization\
    \ is required to approve a transac-\ntion between two parties. In a public blockchain,\
    \ the trans-\naction is inserted by consensus which happens when the \nmajority\
    \ of nodes validate the transaction.\nAsymmetric-key cryptography: It is public-key\
    \ cryptogra-\nphy that is used to enable certitude between the transacting \n\
    parties who are unsure about each other’s integrity. Asym-\nmetric-key cryptography\
    \ uses mathematically related keys to \nensure safety as well as the secrecy of\
    \ data. The public key \nand Private key, even though relative is used for decryption\
    \ \nand encryption, respectively.\nMiners: When two users create a transaction,\
    \ the miners \nvalidate that transaction in the block data before putting it \n\
    on the ledger. The average time it takes for a miner to mine a \nblock is 10 min.\
    \ Since miners use their energy and hardware \nto solve a block, they also require\
    \ an incentive for their work \nwhich is mostly paid in cryptocurrency.\nConsensus:\
    \ A consensus can be identified as a decision-\nmaking criterion. It makes sure\
    \ that all the nodes validate a \nblock and no such duplicity exists in the ledger\
    \ that hasn’t \nbeen agreed upon. The discussion involved in consensus is \nFig.\

    \ viewpoint between the participants by applying \na set of rules.\nEthereum:\
    \ introduced by Vitalik Buterin [29] addressed \nvarious limitations of the scripting\
    \ language in the block-\nchain. The platform is used to build and publish distributed\
    \ \napplications by using a programming language. It is said \nto be an improvement\
    \ over the blockchain structure. It pro-\nvides data-friendly services to all\
    \ and sundry no matter their \nlocation or background. Ethereum consists of full\
    \ nodes that \nrun the Ethereum Virtual machine to deploy distributed pro-\ngrams\
    \ such as smart contracts. Application development in \nblockchain can be done\
    \ through Ethereum which can also \ncall multiple other blockchain, protocols,\
    \ and cryptocurren-\ncies [30]. Ethereum uses the chain of global computers to\
    \ \noperate and runs smart contracts that are free of intermediar-\nies or third-party\
    \ censorships. Ethereum uses an incentive \nmechanism [31] to encourage programmers\
    \ who run the \nFig. 4  Blockchain technology diagram\n2423\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ to compensate for hardware and energy \nused in running decentralized digital\
    \ applications (dapps). \nThese incentives are called Ether which is a cryptocurrency\
    \ \nin the Ethereum protocol.\n1.1.4  Blockchain Development Platforms and Tools\n\
    To simplify the blockchain processes and to ease the devel-\nopment various tools\
    \ and programming languages have been \nintroduced.\n1.1.4.1 Ethereum Virtual\
    \ Machine (EVM) The executing \ncode and the Executing machine consist of an abstraction\
    \ \nwhich is referred to as virtual machines, and Ethereum vir-\ntual machines\
    \ increase the intended code execution chances, \nand the consensus is maintained\
    \ on it [32].\n1.1.4.2 Remix IDE Remix Integrated Development Envi-\nronment is\
    \ open-source software for web or desktop devel-\nopment. An intuitive and appealing\
    \ interface remix allows \nsmart contract development and Ethereum interaction\
    \ [33]. \nRemix IDE has multiple plugin options such as Web3 inte-\ngration, embedded\
    \ Web3, and Javascript for running the \ncontract locally. Solidity smart contract\
    \ programming lan-\nguage is used for development in Remix IDE.\n1.1.4.3 Smart\
    \ Contracts Simple programs stored on the \nblockchain comprise some predefined\
    \ conditions [34]. \nUpon meeting the conditions the contract is self-executed\
    \ \ngiving the edge of non-intermediary processes as well as \ntime efficiency.\
    \ Multiple programming languages are used \nto develop smart contracts for blockchain;\
    \ a few of them \nhave been discussed below:\n• Solidity [35]: A highly preferred\
    \ object-oriented design-\nbased, high-level language conveniently made for \n\
    developing smart contracts. Most of the solidity syntax \ninspiration came from\
    \ C ++ , Javascript, and Python pro-\ngramming languages. Solidity, along with\
    \ being the top \nsmart contract language focusing on EVM in certain also \nsupports\
    \ inheritance and user-defined types.\n• Vyper [36]: Highly influenced by python\
    \ and the sec-\nond-best after Solidity, vyper is based on three important \n\
    principles namely auditability to ensure the readability \nand understandability\
    \ of the code for the user, Security \nto ensure secure smart contracts, and Simplicity\
    \ of the \nlanguage and the implementation.\n• Yul [37]: An intermediate smart\
    \ contract development \nlanguage that includes the bytecode compilation accord-\n\
    ing to different backend needs. The main focuses of Yul \nare simplicity in bytecode\
    \ translation, understandability, \nand readability of the scripted programs.\
    \ Yul supports \nstack machines and is specifically tailored for them, \nwhole-program\
    \ optimization, and static type reference \nand value nature.\n1.1.4.4 Hyperledger\
    \ A Linux framework for blockchain \ndevelopment that provides standards and tools\
    \ for open-\nsource blockchain applications [38]. Hyperledger enterprise \nhelps\
    \ build permissioned blockchain solutions for busi-\nnesses and services. Under\
    \ the Hyperledger Framework, \nmultiple projects have been introduced:\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric: A modular permissioned and private \nframework for blockchain technology\
    \ used for develop-\ning solutions for businesses and private enterprises. Fab-\n\
    ric has a well updated smart contract interaction, faster \ntransactions, and\
    \ efficient data sharing.\n• Hyperledger Explorer: Explorer is a user-friendly\
    \ block-\nchain development web application tool. The interface \nprovides detailed\
    \ information about the blocks, trans-\nactions, network nodes, and the state\
    \ of the blocks. \nHyperledger Explorer uses visualization tools for repre-\n\
    senting the blockchain data in a user-friendly and read-\nable manner.\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Sawtooth: By separating the core system, \nthat is, specifying the business\
    \ rules without interact-\ning with the application domain is the main task of\
    \ \nhyperledger sawtooth. It supports the Practical Byzantine \nFault Tolerance\
    \ (PBFT) as well as the Proof of Elapsed \nTime (POET). The smart contracts can\
    \ be developed and \nrun on the platform without actually knowing the core \n\
    system’s design.\nFig. 5  Blockchain components\n2424\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\n• Hyperledger Caliper: A blockchain benchmark tool, the \ncaliper used\
    \ pre-defined uses cases to test the blockchain \nsolutions along with a test\
    \ result of its performance. Cali-\nper has a very proficient success rate for\
    \ testing the suc-\ncessful and failed transactions, provides the maximum, \n\
    minimum, and average latency of transaction and read \ndata for the test cycle.\n\
    Limitations of Blockchain are limited but cannot be disre-\ngarded [39]. From\
    \ the creation of the node to the validation \nby miners, Blockchain consumes\
    \ a lot of energy. Splitting of \nthe chain is another problem where a node does\
    \ not accept \nthe transactions in a new chain if it is operating to the old \n\
    software. The computing requirements increase as the block-\nchain grows. Since\
    \ all the nodes cannot provide the neces-\nsary capacity, the node breaks, and\
    \ the immutability and \ntransparency of the blockchain cease to exist.\n1.1.5\
    \  Blockchain for Smart Village Applications\nThe scenario in a typical village\
    \ is such, in terms of the \ninfrastructure most of it is inadequately built,\
    \ there exists \nschools and colleges but poorly maintained, poorly built \nhouses\
    \ with no constraints for disaster management. In \nterms of necessities, normal\
    \ villages lack stable electricity \nsupplies, or a secure income to support electricity\
    \ bills, and \nnon-purified water. People in villages are often neglected \nand\
    \ most of the dwellers don’t have any personal or national \nidentity. The healthcare\
    \ system in villages is simple and inef-\nficient which does not help during major\
    \ problems. Normal \nvillages lack any technological advancement and people \n\
    there live in history because of the lacking development. \nSustainable development\
    \ with the concept of smart villages \ncan give a secure and feasible future to\
    \ the villages.\nBeyond the conventional use of blockchain in finance \nusing\
    \ cryptocurrency, numerous applications can change the \nway we perceive digitization.\
    \ According to Kandaswamy \n[40], blockchain can have four types of initiatives:\
    \ block-\nchain disruptor, digital asset, efficiency play, and record-\nkeeper\
    \ (Fig. 6). With similar inventiveness some of the \nblockchain applications with\
    \ the concept of a smart village \ncan be enumerated as:\nHealthcare: Blockchain\
    \ with its record-keeping charac-\nteristics and smart contract with its privacy\
    \ and security has \ngreatly assisted the medical area by providing a solution\
    \ \nfor publicly or semi-private sharing of the medical data of \npatients. This\
    \ can help the researchers and students to elicit \na new solution or use it for\
    \ clinical trials [41]. The solution \nfor missing health documents or previous\
    \ clinic visit records \ncan be improved through blockchain. The potential of\
    \ Block-\nchain to store patient’s record on the ledger make it possible \nto\
    \ get treatment across the globe. Furthermore, the problem \nof counterfeit drugs\
    \ in the market can be resolved through \nthe traceability solution from blockchain\
    \ through which fake \nmedicines can be traced and removed from the supply chain.\n\
    International payments and insurance: Accelerated pay-\nment to international\
    \ locations is possible through block-\nchain technology. Several Bitcoin-operated\
    \ services make it \neasier to transfer money cross-border. The process includes\
    \ \nconverting the payer’s local currency into Bitcoin bypass-\ning the existing\
    \ banking infrastructure and then converting \nthat Bitcoin into the receiver’s\
    \ local currency. This saves the \ntrade cost and speeds up the transaction. Apart\
    \ from that, \nthe insurance industry can also be benefitted from block-\nchain\
    \ technology [42]. Blockchain can provide a transparent \nand trustworthy system\
    \ to overcome the challenges of the \ninsurance industry. Fraudulent claims, intermediary\
    \ payment \ntransactions, and big data handling are some of the many \nissues\
    \ faced by insurance companies. Blockchain can resolve \nthe issues through its\
    \ security and transparency provided by \nthe distributed ledger which also furnishes\
    \ the authentic-\nity of the participants. Besides, its characteristic of record-\n\
    keeping comes in handy with the huge amount of customer \ndata that is immutable\
    \ in the blockchain ledger. Additionally, \nby using the smart contracts real-time\
    \ data of the claims, \nreimbursements or payments can be fetched from multiple\
    \ \nsystems in no time.\nPersonal Identity Record-keeping: Identity is an integral\
    \ \npart of society that provides a unique character and sense \nof acceptability\
    \ in a country. However, physical forms of \nnational identity are not accessible\
    \ to many people around \nthe world. The absence of identity makes it difficult\
    \ for \npeople to participate in voting, banking, employment and \nlimits the\
    \ chances of access to the financial system. Here \nblockchain steps in by providing\
    \ identity solutions through \nFig. 6  Blockchain elements\n2425\nA Systematic\
    \ Literature Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\ndigital\
    \ identity. Additionally, self-sovereign identity arranges \noptions to store\
    \ one's identity on devices accessible across \nthe world [43].\nSupply chain\
    \ and logistics: Blockchain can bring great \nusability to supply chain management.\
    \ Procurement, trace-\nability, digital payments, and logistics are some areas\
    \ that \nhave benefitted from blockchain technology. The distributed \nledger\
    \ can reduce the sharing of operational data by provid-\ning a full view of the\
    \ sale/purchase data, accessible from \nany device. Fraud in the food supply chain\
    \ is prevalent in \nmany countries. Counterfeit products selling in the market\
    \ \nprove hazardous to the consumer. The Block chain’s QR \ntracking system along\
    \ with digitized physical products can \nbe used to track products from production\
    \ to delivery [44]. \nThis technology has started benefiting the agricultural\
    \ sec-\ntor to develop food safety and smart farming increasing the \nincome of\
    \ small farms and food producers.\nEducation: Keeping physical records and transcripts\
    \ can \nbe a hassle. This blockchain provides a solution for digitiz-\ning student\
    \ records, transcripts, and payment receipts [45]. \nDigital record-keeping can\
    \ benefit a student as it will be \nacceptable by universities across the globe,\
    \ free of manipula-\ntion, and handy. Blockchain can also be used to incentivize\
    \ \nstudents through a course credit system. The credit can be \ntranslated to\
    \ cryptocurrency, which can be further used as \nfee payment.\nBlockchain with\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT): Powerful \nunion of two futuristic technologies\
    \ makes machine-to-\nmachine transactions easier. The decentralized authority\
    \ \nof blockchain combined with the smart devices run by IoT \nallows a function\
    \ to autonomously execute without a central \nauthority [46]. Smart IoT run devices\
    \ can be implemented \non edge devices, reducing data transfer costs, and security\
    \ \nissues with the blockchain collaboration [47]. Blockchain \nintegration with\
    \ IoT can highly change the agricultural sec-\ntor. Supply chain traceability\
    \ could benefit the farmers in \neliminating the intermediaries through traceability\
    \ and RFID \ntag-based applications. Water, soil, climate, and other sen-\nsory-type\
    \ IoT devices can help in monitoring the agricultural \nactivities and gathering\
    \ the farm data and activities such as \ncultivation and livestock data in the\
    \ blockchain ledger. IoT \nwith blockchain will certainly revolutionize and transform\
    \ \nmany rural and urban sectors.\n1.2  Motivation and Major Contributions\nSustainable\
    \ Rural development starts with the participation \nof rural people in improving\
    \ their lifestyle. Without the peo-\nple working for their development, any implementation\
    \ or \nhelp is incomplete. Economic and technological sector links \nare important\
    \ for rural areas to develop. Along with that, a \nhealthy agricultural sector\
    \ improves the dweller’s linkage to \nthe global supply sector. By managing the\
    \ social, economic, \nenvironmental, and health objectives the development can\
    \ be \nfast-forwarded. There is a considerable amount of potential \nin rural\
    \ people which can be applied to employment issues, \nsocial disparities, E-governance,\
    \ women's rights etcetera. \nDeveloping rural areas can benefit nationally, economically,\
    \ \nand financially. This systematic literature review aims to pro-\nvide extensive\
    \ literature related to blockchain’s application \nin rural development and sustainable\
    \ living. A plethora of \nblockchain review papers available does not provide\
    \ a col-\nlective literature review of blockchain applications divided \ninto\
    \ different areas directed towards rural and sustainable \ndevelopment. Therefore,\
    \ clear and concise information can \nbe gained about blockchain’s work in improving\
    \ rural devel-\nopment providing scope for future research in this direction.\
    \ \nThe primary contributions are mentioned below:\n• A systematic review of relevant\
    \ literature for research \ntrends, key applications, and areas of implementing\
    \ \nBlockchain Technology for smart villages for sustain-\nable rural development.\n\
    • Identification of major issues in rural development and \nhow they can be addressed\
    \ using Blockchain Technology.\n• Exploration of the existing software, platforms,\
    \ and tools \nfor the implementation of Blockchain in Rural Develop-\nment.\n\
    • Identifications of the research gaps and future research \ndirections for applying\
    \ Blockchain Technology to Rural \nDevelopment.\nTo conduct a fair and precise\
    \ literature review, the stud-\nies have been selectively chosen after processing\

    \ Review on Blockchain \nTechnology for Sustainable Rural \nDevelopment\nThe literature\
    \ review consists of the collective work of \nblockchain in rural development.\
    \ A total of 6 areas of \napplication were identified after careful extraction\
    \ of data \nand transformation globally namely: Agriculture, Bank-\ning, Environment,\
    \ Energy, Employment, and Healthcare. A \ndetailed discussion on the related work\
    \ is discussed in the \nsubsections.\n4.1  Agriculture\nIn the agriculture sector,\
    \ most of the application areas \nincluded supply chain traceability, facilitation\
    \ of smart agri-\nculture, and incentivization of services (Fig. 14). A detailed\
    \ \nsummary is given in Tables 5, 6, and 7.\n4.1.1  Supply Chain Traceability\n\
    The author F. Tian, [51] studied the integration of RFID \n(Radio-frequency Identification)\
    \ and blockchain technology \nin building the agri-food supply chain traceability\
    \ system. \nWith the help of blockchain technology, the information \nshared and\
    \ traceability is guaranteed. Apart from the sup-\nply chain, it also regulates\
    \ food safety and quality supervi-\nsion. This system can enhance the credibility\
    \ and reliabil-\nity of agri-food safety information. With the depletion of \n\
    an application cost, this system can effectively change the \ncurrent supply chain\
    \ to be more quality-enhanced and safe. \nSimilarly, Hua et al. proposed an agriculture\
    \ [65] provenance \nsystem based on blockchain featured by decentralization, \n\
    collective maintenance, consensus trust, and reliable data \nto solve the trust\
    \ crisis in the product supply chain. The \nsystem’s Target is to record information\
    \ related to the pro-\nduction supply chain: production, processing, storage,\
    \ trans-\nportation, and distribution of agricultural products. It also \nfacilitates\
    \ Recordkeeping from basic planting information \nto provenance records. The proposed\
    \ work solved the issue \nof the credibility of data and the difficulty of integrating\
    \ the \nsubsystem of each company.\nThe paper by Casado-Vara et al., [58] addressed\
    \ the issues \nof the current supply chain such as communication gaps \nbetween\
    \ vendors or the opacity of the origin of the product. \nThe author has proposed\
    \ a new model of the supply chain \nvia blockchain where all the members of the\
    \ supply chain \nsave all their transactions in the blockchain to ensure higher\
    \ \nsecurity. This model also enables a circular economy that \nis a make-use-recycle\
    \ model. With this model, all products \ncan be traced from their origin to their\
    \ sale and subsequent \nrecycling.\nFurther, Caro et al., [70] presented AgriBlockIoT\
    \ which \nis a fully decentralized blockchain-based traceability solu-\ntion for\
    \ agricultural food supply chain management. The \nproposed architecture based\
    \ on API includes a controller to \nconvert high-level function calls to corresponding\
    \ for the \nblockchain layer and blockchain itself which is the main \nFig. 10\

    blockchain can create transparent, fault-tolerant, immuta-\nble, and auditable\
    \ agri-food traceability records. The authors \nLi and Wang, [85] characterized\
    \ the research applications \nof blockchain in food supply traceability. With\
    \ the help of \nblockchain technology and various radiofrequency devices \ncan\
    \ be integrated to collect data from farms, deploy sensors, \nand create intelligent\
    \ contracts to implement server logic. \nThe new system can change the traditional\
    \ food supply sys-\ntem by making it more convenient, efficient, and trustable.\
    \ \nKim et al., [54] presented a theoretical, end-to-end, vis a vie \n“farm-to-fork”,\
    \ food traceability application named Harvest \nNetwork with the integration of\
    \ Blockchain technology and \nInternet-of-things. The process includes tracing\
    \ the prod-\nucts from processing, grading, transportation, temperature, \nand\
    \ contractual payment all with blockchain, IoT, and smart \ncontracts. This can\
    \ help consumers gain field-level insight \ninto the products. Lin et al., [63]\
    \ proposed an IoT and block-\nchain integrated self-organized, open, and ecological\
    \ food \ntraceability system. The proposed model consisted of trade, \nlogistics,\
    \ delivery, and warehousing information as well as \ndata from IoT devices such\
    \ as soil humidity, soil pH, and soil \nFig. 11  Areas of blockchain application\

    \ \ninformation about the product they buy with the help of a \ntrusted, self-organized\
    \ smart agriculture ecosystem.\nGalvez et al., [78] review the potential of blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology in guaranteeing traceability and authenticity in the \nfood supply\
    \ chain. The review included blockchain solutions \nto traceability problems.\
    \ It explained the use of a chronologi-\ncal distributed database to coordinate\
    \ individual activities. \nBy using a probabilistic approach to enable transparency\
    \ \nand verifiability without a central authority, enabling con-\nsensus on a\
    \ transaction to secure legitimate transactions, \nand time-stamped blocks providing\
    \ immutable records to \npreserve records the traceability issues were solved.\
    \ The \npaper also discussed the Block chain’s concept on the food \nsupply chain\
    \ which provides transparency, efficiency, secu-\nrity, and safety to the food\
    \ produce. According to Kamble \net al., [55], the supply chain practitioners\
    \ found a lack of \nefficiency and transparency which leads to constant threats\
    \ \nto formers and consumers. The system deployed the ISM \nmethodology to identify\
    \ Blockchain technology enablers \nin the agriculture supply chain. The findings\
    \ implied the \nacceptance of blockchain technology as an innovative tool to \n\
    ensure an efficient agriculture supply chain by the practition-\ners. To achieve\
    \ further traceability the farmers could cap-\nture relevant information about\
    \ the agricultural events onto \nthe blockchain to enable transparent and trusting\
    \ sources of \ninformation for the farmers. Kamilaris et al., [60] explored \n\
    how the food supply chain and agriculture were impacted \nby blockchain technology.\
    \ The stages of the supply chain \nwith blockchain technology has been identified\
    \ as (1) the \nprovider (2) producer, (3) processing, (4) distribution, (5) \n\
    retailer, and (6) consumer where a web application or device \ncan be used to\
    \ scan the item’s QR code to view its detailed \ninformation. Along with this,\
    \ the author explored various \nchallenges and benefits of the agricultural supply\
    \ chain \nand Blockchain’s collaboration. Salah et al., [66] proposed \na solution\
    \ of eliminating the third parties and centralized \nauthorities in the food supply\
    \ chain along with a security \nsystem for food traceability, transparent records,\
    \ and gov-\nernance of interactions and transactions between the users. \nThe\
    \ model entities are related to providing secure tracking \nof the product and\
    \ payment with Ethereum smart contracts. \nThus, the presented model for traceability\
    \ can be used to \ntrace and track the soybean supply chain. S. Missineo, [75]\
    \ \nproposed a model to secure storage origin provenance for \nfood data. The\
    \ proposed system aims to certify the produc-\ntion and the supply chain concerning\
    \ food local products \nby using Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. The\
    \ \nauthor aimed to ensure the authenticity of typical Sardinian \nproducts and\
    \ to sell them online or offline. The platform \nensured the consumer to check\
    \ the authenticity of the prod-\nuct before the purchase giving details on both\
    \ the production \nchain and supply chain. Jaiswal et al., [86] proposed mul-\n\
    tiple smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain \nfor decentralized\
    \ trading of food grains. The framework \nincluded Peer-to-peer trading, the security\
    \ of food grain \ndata, transparency, user anonymity, trust, and incentives as\
    \ \nkey features. The design of the framework consisted of four \ncontracts namely\
    \ food grain supply, bidding, trading, and \nutilization for the supply chain\
    \ management. Dong et al., \n[56] proposed a collaborative model of blockchain\
    \ and IoT \nin the agriculture sector. The data collection and transmis-\nsion\
    \ can be distinguished through a unique identity card \ngiven to each agricultural\
    \ product. All the environmental \naspects of the agricultural process can be\
    \ gathered at the \nsource. Along with that crop growth information, circulation\
    \ \nof the product using an RFID tag and distribution process \ncan also be recorded\
    \ and stored on the distributed ledger. \nA QR code attached to the product can\
    \ be scanned by the \nconsumer to view product information in details.\nFig. 14\

    \ \n1 3\nWithal, Madumidha et al., [145] proposed the use of \nblockchain technology\
    \ to maintain tamper-proof records, \navoid intermediaries and provide security\
    \ to the transac-\ntions which in turn reduces transaction costs and improves\
    \ \nthe quality of the products. The food products are labeled \nwith RFID tags\
    \ to maintain the supply chain. The author \nexplained the revolutionary changes\
    \ blockchain technology \ncan bring to the supply chains and how it can increase\
    \ the \neconomic conditions of a country by reducing corruption \nrates and increasing\
    \ the satisfaction of producers and con-\nsumers. Paul et al., [83] proposed a\
    \ way to eliminate inter-\nmediaries between farmers and consumers to provide\
    \ the \nright amount for the farm produce. The proposed system \nconsists of blockchain\
    \ nodes namely Supply companies, \nlandowners, markets, and farmers. The farmer\
    \ node sets the \namount after the agreement period, the market node collects\
    \ \nand stores crops and stops intermediaries from manipulating \nthe prices,\
    \ the landlord node collects the money from the \nland on lease, and the supply\
    \ company node sells extra agri-\ncultural products to the farmers. This platform\
    \ named KHET \nwhere all the nodes are interconnected through Ethereum \nblockchain\
    \ is beneficial for farmers, landlords, and markets.\nMusah et al., [62] main\
    \ objective in proposing the role of \nblockchain in Ghana’s cocoa beans food\
    \ supply chain was \nto evaluate the contributions made by applications of block-\n\
    chain technology in the supply chain. The system provides \na global traceability\
    \ platform, supply chain intelligence and \nvisibility, Africa cocoa village;\
    \ impact the investing for \nsmallholder farmer and uses Bean tracker. The author\
    \ care-\nfully studied the tools and platforms benefiting the cocoa \nbean production\
    \ and supply chain processes.\nAdditionally, Baralla et al., [146] proposed a\
    \ blockchain-\nbased generic agri-food supply chain traceability system \nfor\
    \ implementing the farm-to-fork model. In this system, \na QR code scan can allow\
    \ the consumer to reconstruct the \nproduct history to verify product health and\
    \ quality. The \nmain contribution of this article was the authentication and\
    \ \nverification of shared data’s integrity in supply chain man-\nagement. With\
    \ the help of this system, the involved operators \ncould identify any new participants\
    \ along with the supply \nchain which increased the degree of trust between organiza-\n\
    tions and individuals. Dakshayini et al., [87] proposed an \nintegrated model\
    \ based on Blockchain, big data, and cloud \nto efficiently manage crops that\
    \ achieve effective demand-\nbased decision support, simplified, transparent,\
    \ and secure \nagricultural supply chain. The proposed model has a higher \npercentile\
    \ of achieving demand and supply of crops which \navoids the farmer’s loss, catering\
    \ to consumer’s needs, pro-\nvides sustainable agricultural practices, reducing\
    \ middlemen \ninvolvement, and reducing price inflation problems. Saji \net al.,\
    \ [88] proposed a model to enhance the supply chain \nperformance by using a blockchain\
    \ network. The proposed \nmodel provides security food safety, traceability, and\
    \ opens \nTable 5  (continued)\nS. no. References Source\nPaper type\nFocus\n\

    \ Villages \n1 3\nnew markets. The system improved farming profitability \nand\
    \ endorsed the financial stability of cultivators. It also \nprovided health benefits,\
    \ reduced food wastage, eliminated \nmanipulation, and adulteration, and supports\
    \ the supply \nchain of agro-products. Saurabh and Dey, [69] identified the \n\
    potential divers of blockchain concerning the grape wine \nsupply chain. The smart\
    \ contract-based module was con-\nstructed to ensure trust between participants\
    \ during trans-\nactions. The proposed model enhanced the customization, \ncompetitiveness,\
    \ and usability of the supply chain.\nIqbal and Butt, [84] proposed a model to\
    \ save the farm-\ner’s crops from animals at night. A repelling and notifying\
    \ \nsystem (RNS) is installed in the field that receives signals \nduring an animal\
    \ attack. Human-safe ultrasonic waves are \nproduced by this RNS which drives\
    \ the animals away. This \nproposal also consists of a farm management system\
    \ that \nreceives the report regarding the hazards caused in the fields. \nThis\
    \ system enabled timely data delivery, efficient multi-hop \ncommunication, dependable\
    \ data transmission, and low-cost \ntechnology. Chun-Ting et al., [73] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-\nbased agricultural traceability service platform for tamper-\n\
    proof data storing and backup. The system design consists of \nData collecting\
    \ layer where IoT sensors collect environmen-\ntal data, the blockchain layer\
    \ takes data from the formal layer \nand sends them to blockchain nodes and later\
    \ to blocks, and \nthe application layer handles the requests to access transac-\n\
    tion data based on the transaction hash. Hegde et al., [81] \npresented different\
    \ ways of implementing blockchain with \nthe agricultural supply chain. With the\
    \ use of blockchain, the \nproducers can get data and income security, and keep\
    \ track \nof environmental changes that affect the crops. The trace-\nability\
    \ option provides clarity in any damage that occurred \nto the product and an\
    \ overall increase in efficiency can be \nachieved by producing only required\
    \ products hence reduc-\ning wastage. Peña et al., [89] presented a systematic\
    \ review \non blockchain in food supply chain management in Ecua-\ndor. According\
    \ to the review, most of the work was done in \nHyperledger composer, models for\
    \ business interactions and \nhuman interactions, Traceability, Security, and\
    \ Blockchain \nInformation.\nAdditionally, M. Kumarathunga, [57] after reviewing\
    \ \npresented the way to reduce transaction costs and improve \nfarmer’s involvement\
    \ in agricultural supply chains. To \nreduce transaction costs farmers can participate\
    \ in Infor-\nmation sharing, goal congruence, decision synchronization, \nincentive\
    \ alignment, resource sharing, collaborative commu-\nnication, joint knowledge\
    \ creation. Xu et al., [80] reviewed \nthe working principle of blockchain technology\
    \ in the agri-\nfood sector. Blockchain technology provided data transpar-\nency,\
    \ data traceability, food safety, and quality monitoring, \nand agriculture finance.\
    \ Additionally, food safety and qual-\nity can be secured by digitizing products.\
    \ According to the \nreview, blockchain revealed a better approach to the future\
    \ \nof the agri-food supply chain which is safer, healthier, sus-\ntainable, and\
    \ reliable. Mirabelli and Solina, [71] collected \nand analyzed the applications\
    \ of blockchain technology and \nits contribution to agricultural food traceability\
    \ issues. The \nreview showed that the usability of blockchain technol-\nogy in\
    \ the agricultural sector was still in the early stage. \nThe review highlighted\
    \ three main aspects namely starting \nproblem, area of interest, and contribution.\
    \ Blockchain can \nbe a valid way to minimize fraud and errors in agricultural\
    \ \nsupply chains by increasing the quality and safety of food \nproducts. Shahid\
    \ et al., [53] have proposed a complete solu-\ntion to the blockchain-based agricultural\
    \ and food supply \nchain. The paper aimed to provide an end-to-end solution \n\
    to the growing blockchain-based agri-food supply chains. \nFurther, it achieved\
    \ the following properties: accountability, \ncredibility, auditability, autonomy,\
    \ and authenticity. The sys-\ntem also acted as a better alternative to the existing\
    \ supply \nchain system by enabling a scalable and auditable system. \nAwan et al.,\
    \ [79] proposed a smart agricultural model as a \ntransformation to the traditional\
    \ agricultural supply chain. \nThe system consists of Seed seller, Farmer, Crop\
    \ buyer, \nProcessor, Crop storage, Distributor, Retailer, Customer. \nTo improve\
    \ the food supply chain’s productivity and reli-\nability the smart model was\
    \ proposed. The model allowed \nfarmers to enter and monitor the data in the plant.\
    \ The main \nobjective of this model was to provide equal opportunities to \n\
    the participants of the agricultural food supply chain. The-\njaswini and Ranjitha,\
    \ [64] proposed a model that explores \nthe problems faced by people in agriculture\
    \ production and \nits solutions based on blockchain technology. Blockchain \n\
    solutions for traceability of crops, disclosure of data, clarity \nin food production,\
    \ and authentic agricultural products was \nproposed by the author. This proposed\
    \ model ensured food \nsafety, benefitted farmers, and stakeholders.\nYadav et al.,\
    \ [67] reviewed the blockchain adoption bar-\nriers in the Indian agricultural\
    \ supply chain. The barriers \ncan be enumerated as Lack of proper government\
    \ regulation \nand regularity uncertainty, Huge resource, and initial capital\
    \ \nrequirement, security and privacy concerns, lack of interop-\nerability and\
    \ standardization, etc. Further, the barriers were \nmodeled using an integrated\
    \ ISM-DEMATEL approach \nwhich provided limited interpretative logic. W. Lin,\
    \ [59] \nprovided a survey to study the techniques and applications \nof blockchain\
    \ technology. The application categories of \nblockchain in agriculture are Provenance\
    \ traceability and \nfood authentication, smart farming data management, trade\
    \ \nfinance in the supply chain management, and other informa-\ntion management\
    \ systems. The paper also indicated possible \nfuture developments and applications\
    \ of blockchain. Dutta \net al., [61] reviewed articles related to blockchain\
    \ technol-\nogy’s integration with various supply chain operations. The \nbenefits\
    \ of Blockchain in supply chains can be enumer-\nated as Data management, Improvement\
    \ in transparency, \n2444\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nImprovement in response\
    \ time smart contract management, \nOperational efficiency, and Disintermediation,\
    \ Immutabil-\nity, and Intellectual Property management. According to \nthe review,\
    \ the main supply chain functions were identified \nas supply chain provenance,\
    \ supply chain resilience, supply \nchain re-engineering, security enhancement,\
    \ business pro-\ncess management, and product management. The work also \nexamined\
    \ various challenges and impacts of blockchain in \nthe supply chain. Shahid et al.,\
    \ [77] proposed a solution for \na blockchain-based reputation system in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfood supply chain. The system model consisted of invoking \nsmart contracts\
    \ to provide reviews based on the services to \nthe providers. The reviews are\
    \ requested by buyers and the \nsellers’ review the transactions and perform other\
    \ transac-\ntions based on that. The system was proposed to maintain \nthe immutability\
    \ and integrity of the registered review. \nTorky and Hassanein, [82] presented\
    \ a comprehensive sur-\nvey on IoT and blockchain and their importance in devel-\n\
    oping smart applications. According to the review, crops \noverseeing, livestock\
    \ grazing, and food supply chain are a \nfew subsectors in precision agriculture\
    \ managed by block-\nchain platforms. Apart from that, a novel blockchain model\
    \ \nwas also proposed to use as an important solution for major \nchallenges in\
    \ IoT-based precision agricultural systems. The \nobjectives of Skender and Zaninović,\
    \ [74] in their paper \nwere to analyze blockchain technology’s overall perspec-\n\
    tive, investigate its potential in a sustainable supply chain \nto replace the\
    \ shortcomings in the traditional supply chain. \nThe traceability and transparency\
    \ in the agricultural supply \nchain can be improved with blockchain.\nTo better\
    \ understand the benefits and challenges and the \nperspective for sustainable\
    \ blockchain, the author provided \na conceptual framework. Borah et al., [68]\
    \ proposed a novel \nblockchain-based Farmer and Rely called FARMAR. The \nsystem\
    \ could provide fair prices and reduce duping by mid-\ndlemen. The assets can\
    \ be traced from farmers to consumers, \nreducing the artificial inflation of\
    \ prices. Ferrag et al., (2020) \n[76] reviewed the research challenges on IoT-based\
    \ agricul-\nture and its security and privacy issues. The rest of the paper \n\
    identified threat models against green IoT-based agriculture \nanalyzed the privacy-oriented\
    \ blockchain-based solutions \nand consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture.\
    \ \nEnescu and Ionescu, [52] proposed a model for farmers in \nthe agri-food sector\
    \ using blockchain. This system ensures a \ncredible supply chain for producers\
    \ and consumers, guaran-\nteed timely payments between the participants. The authors\
    \ \nproposed this system to provide transparency, security, and \ntrust in the\
    \ trading process. Chaudhari et al., [90] proposed \na framework for a secure\
    \ and transparent supply chain with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With\
    \ the help of this sys-\ntem, the farmers can get a fair price for their products.\
    \ This \ntransparent and tamper-proof supply chain system generates \na bill at\
    \ the end including the commissioning price as well as \nthe total price after\
    \ sold product hence benefiting the farm-\ners in knowing the selling and market\
    \ price. Xie et al., [91] \nproposed to construct a traceability framework For\
    \ fresh \nE-commerce agricultural product quality and safety based \non blockchain\
    \ technology. To access the key control points \nthe author used the FMECA (failure\
    \ model effect and key \nanalysis) to analyze the failure mode, impact, and hazards\
    \ \nin the traceability chain. This system can promote agricul-\ntural development\
    \ through decentralization, consensus trust, \nmaintenance, and reliable database\
    \ features.\nFurthermore, Li et al., [92] proposed a blockchain-based \nTraceability\
    \ of the fresh food supply chain With the help of \nbusiness process reengineering\
    \ (BPR). The overall traceabil-\nity architecture is based on key links’ product\
    \ quality data \nand participants’ transactions. The objective of this trace-\n\
    ability system was to ensure data integrity. Flores et al., [93] \nproposed a\
    \ model for decentralization of data and provide \ntraceability of agricultural\
    \ products with blockchain tech-\nnology. Using this method could guarantee transparency\
    \ of \nthe supply chain and other operations as well as the transac-\ntions involved.\
    \ Fernandez et al., [94] proposed a Blockchain-\nbased model to improve farmer’s\
    \ profits. The author aimed \nto improve the output primitives of the supply chain.\
    \ Farmer-\nto-consumer product tracking and cost were the main factors \nin improving\
    \ traceability in the supply chain. Cortez-Zaga \net al., [95] proposed a model\
    \ used in the Peruvian agricul-\ntural sector using blockchain. When using blockchain\
    \ it can \neliminate dependence on a central entity, provides integrity \nof the\
    \ process, transactions become irrevocable, secure, \nand private, and provides\
    \ transparency and immutability. \nG. Zhao, [96] presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that \nexplored the advances in the agri-food supply chain. The \npaper\
    \ also pointed out the challenge of the applications of \nblockchain technology\
    \ enumerated as storage capacity and \nscalability, privacy leakage, high-cost\
    \ problem, regulation \nproblem, throughput and latency issues, and lack of skills.\n\
    Land record maintenance using blockchain was also \nproposed by Bhorshetti et al.,\
    \ for easy maintenance of land \nrecords in real-time. The database proved to\
    \ be a non-failure \nsystem and the work provided intermediary-less land title\
    \ \ntransfer and processing between owners. This system pro-\nvided security,\
    \ transparency, and a broker-free land man-\nagement system [97]. The paper by\
    \ Thakur et al. presented \nthe issues related to land records maintenance, registration,\
    \ \nsettlements, and banks. The system ensured better land man-\nagement, lesser\
    \ fraudulent transactions while strengthening \nthe sustainable development goals\
    \ (SDG) and increasing the \nGDP of the country [98].\n4.1.2  Agriculture Security\
    \ System\nTse et al., [102] proposed food supply information security \nbased\
    \ on blockchain technology. The use of blockchain in \n2445\nA Systematic Literature\
    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nthis system can regain\
    \ the people’s trust in the food mar-\nket, the government can collect statistics\
    \ on various kinds \nof food, and adulterated and fake food in the market can\
    \ \nbe eliminated. This type of technology can benefit the cus-\ntomer, manufacturers,\
    \ and supervision departments of the \nfood supply chain. Wu and Tsai, [103] proposed\
    \ an intel-\nligent agriculture network security system by applying dark \nweb\
    \ technology to monitor packet transmission frequency in \norder to prevent DDOS\
    \ attacks. The system applied a dark-\nnet mechanism to identify anyone who attempts\
    \ to access \nblockchain data. It also incorporated IoT sensors to gather \ndata\
    \ regarding temperature, humidity, and soil. This model \nwas proposed to keep\
    \ track of the farms and cultivation fac-\ntors related to an environment and\
    \ to establish network secu-\nrity for IoT networks.\n4.1.3  Organic Farming\n\
    Reddy and Kumar, [101] presented the article based on the \nsustainability of\
    \ the food supply chain. The author's objec-\ntive was to achieve Fair Trading\
    \ and a circular economy with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With this framework,\
    \ the \nfollowing results but achieved: Automatic hashing for less \nelectricity\
    \ consumption, product malfunctioning and add \nalteration, the involvement of\
    \ middlemen, availability of \nfarming jobs, and facilitating development and\
    \ unity among \nfarmers. According to Basnayake and Rajapakse, [104], the \npurpose\
    \ of the research was to implement a Blockchain-\nbased solution to verify food\
    \ quality. The process included \nFarmers issuing a product contract to control\
    \ the quality of \neach product. For each deployment of the product contract,\
    \ \nit would return an address that was used to generate the QR \ncode to identify\
    \ the physical product. Lastly, Consumers \nwere also eligible to rate the product\
    \ quality to ensure trust.\n4.1.4  Smart Agriculture\nTo overcome remote monitoring\
    \ challenges and provide \nsecurity and privacy in agriculture, Patil et al.,\
    \ [105] pro-\nposed a lightweight architecture for smart greenhouse farm-\ning.\
    \ The model consisted of four groups showing the integra-\ntion of blockchain\
    \ with IoT namely (1) smart greenhouse, (2) \noverlay network, (3) Cloud storage,\
    \ and (4) End-user. This \nmodel can be used to successfully monitor the secure\
    \ trans-\nmission of greenhouse data. Umamaheshwari et al., [106] \nproposed a\
    \ model for Buying and selling crops and land. \nThe model used Ethers as a cryptocurrency.\
    \ According to \nthe paper, the recordkeeping of crops grown in the land was \n\
    useful to know the history of plantations in the land. With \nthe help of this\
    \ model, users were able to access real-time \ndata about crops, eliminate the\
    \ need for middlemen, and \nestablish a transparent and efficient system. Voutos\
    \ et al., \n[107] proposed the integration of IoT and smart contracts \nto develop\
    \ smart agriculture to deliver higher quality agri-\ncultural products. It also\
    \ focuses on improving the associ-\nated supply chain and logistics benefiting\
    \ the participants \ninvolved. The author discussed the factors of smart agri-\n\
    culture as soil factors, climate, sensors, research, supply \nchain, storage,\
    \ analytics, and smart contracts. Miloudi et al., \n[100] proposed IoT, Blockchain,\
    \ and Geospatial technology-\nbased Smart farming to manage the farming practices\
    \ more \nsmartly and sustainably. The system proposed smart farming \nmanagement\
    \ in 4 stages namely (1) Integrated blockchain \nwith IoT platform where various\
    \ IoT sensors apply analytics \nand sends data to the blockchain, (2) Blockchain\
    \ Working \nMethodology where data visibility is provided through smart \ncontracts,\
    \ (3) Integrating GIS with blockchain where the \ndata sent from IoT sensors are\
    \ improvised and accuracy is \nfacilitated through GIS geospatial tools, and (4)\
    \ certifying \nfarmers in blockchain stage facilitates authorities and privi-\n\
    leges to the farmers through smart contracts which could \ngreatly benefit farmers\
    \ and food production industry.\nFurthermore, Devi Et al., [108] Proposed a design\
    \ archi-\ntecture by merging IoT and BC for smart agriculture. The \nnodes involved\
    \ in the blockchain received the information \nfrom the sensors that were connected\
    \ to the things involved \nin the Smart Agriculture monitoring process. The design\
    \ \narchitecture enhanced the security and data transparency \nperformance of\
    \ smart agriculture. Vangala et al., [109] \nreviewed blockchain technology and\
    \ its information security \nschemes. The application areas covered by the authors\
    \ were \nagriculture monitoring, controlled agriculture/smart green-\nhouses,\
    \ food supply chain tracking, and precision farming/\nsmart farming. The review\
    \ also presented a thorough analy-\nsis of the security attributes, application\
    \ areas, advantages, \ndrawbacks, and competing schemes’ cost of computation \n\
    and communication. Branco et al., [110] proposed a con-\nceptual approach with\
    \ the integration of IoT and blockchain \nfor a mushroom farm distribution process\
    \ control system. \nThe proposed system allowed the collection of distributed\
    \ \ndata on the environmental factors contributing to mushroom \nproduction providing\
    \ collection, storage, and processing of \nmushroom farm data to be scalable,\
    \ immutable, transparent, \nauditable, and secure.\n4.1.5  Dairy Farming\nMisra\
    \ and Das, [111] presented a conceptual framework \nusing blockchain to bring\
    \ feasibility and efficiency in \nE-governance. The architecture consisted of\
    \ a service-\noriented architecture framework to store details of stake-\nholders\
    \ involved in user services on demand, a blockchain \narchitecture that would\
    \ allow stakeholders to authenticate \nand perform transactions on the ledger,\
    \ and digital identity \narchitecture to act as a regulator in the architecture.\
    \ With \na dairy farmer as a user or participant in the architecture \n2446\n\
    \ \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nwho would benefit from the transactions while\
    \ having vot-\ning rights and leadership entities in the system the author \n\
    conceptually explored the prototype of the dairy coopera-\ntive sector in India.\
    \ Similarly, Rambim and Awuor, [112] \nproposed a model for dairy farmers in Kenya\
    \ that explores \nthe potential use of blockchain technology in milk delivery\
    \ \nin rural areas. From the Naitiri Dairy farmers’ cooperative \n(NADAFA) in\
    \ Kenya, the author introduced a Milk Deliv-\nery Blockchain Manager (MDBM) which\
    \ is a decentralized \nplatform to automatically capture the quantity and quality\
    \ \nof milk delivered by the farmers. The delivery data stored \nin the blockchain\
    \ is immutable, cryptographically hashed, \nand digitally signed. The details\
    \ of delivery are accessible \nto the farmers. The NADAFA facilitates the system\
    \ and pro-\nvides payment to the dairy farmers on time. The consortium-\nbased\
    \ network provides leveraging blockchain solutions for \nfarmers.\n4.1.6  Livestock\n\
    Under Livestock monitoring, Alonso et al., [113] worked on \nimportant trends\
    \ in the applications of IoT and edge comput-\ning paradigms in the smart farming\
    \ field. This helps produc-\ners to optimize processes, provides the origin of\
    \ the product, \nand guarantees the quality to its consumers. The state of \n\
    dairy cattle and feed grain can be monitored in real-time by \nusing artificial\
    \ intelligence and blockchain technology. This \nis to ensure the traceability\
    \ and sustainability of different \nprocesses of farming. The implementation of\
    \ smart farm-\ning contributed to the reduction of data traffic and reliable \n\
    communications between IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. \nAccording to Hang et al.,\
    \ [114], the uncertain data qual-\nity of analysts’ data can be solved through\
    \ blockchain. The \nproposed structure brings scalability, off-chain storage,\
    \ pri-\nvacy, and high throughput as advancement to the previous \nversion. Various\
    \ IoT data is fetched from fish farms such \nas temperature, water level, oxygen,\
    \ and PH data. The data \nstorage can be a database or cloud and end-user can\
    \ view \nthe fish farm’s detailed information through smart devices. \nLeme et al.,\
    \ [147] proposed a novel infrastructure based on \nthe integration of cloud storage\
    \ and blockchain technology \nto monitor the overall health of livestock. The\
    \ components \nof the architecture can be named as (1) Administrator, (2) \nUsers,\
    \ (3) Cloud service, and (4) blockchain network. With \nthe help of RFID tags\
    \ attached to the cattle, various entities \ncan be monitored to ensure that cattle\
    \ go through necessary \nprocedures. Yang et al., [115] proposed a novel method\
    \ to \nensure traceability and authenticity in the livestock supply \nchain using\
    \ blockchain. The model uses RFID-sensor-based \nlivestock monitoring in the food\
    \ industry where the sen-\nsors augment the physical tracking and solved the RFID’s\
    \ \ninherent computational capacity limitation by using cloud \nservices. The\
    \ data is then made accessible to the end con-\nsumer through Block chain’s transparent\
    \ ledger.\n4.1.7  E‑Agriculture\nThe analysis proposed by Li et al., [116] Investigated\
    \ the \nconvenience of sustainable electronic agriculture based on \nBlockchain\
    \ technology and analyzed the application likeli-\nhood and challenges of Blockchain\
    \ in the agricultural field. \nThe authors selected 5 villages with similar development\
    \ \nrates in china and Blockchain technology was applied using \ndata statistics\
    \ to the sustainable e-agriculture for exploring \nits convenience. Results showed\
    \ that sustainable electronic \nagriculture based on Blockchain Technology brought\
    \ great \nconvenience to the farmer’s sales, increasing by 25% on \naverage compared\
    \ with traditional electronic agriculture. \nSong et al. [117], to improve the\
    \ biased point of view, higher \ninitial costs, and lack of transparency and trust\
    \ proposed a \nsystem for providing sustainability in the current agri-food \n\
    supply chain. The paper discussed blockchain adoption in \nrural areas and relative\
    \ energy consumption from supply and \ndemand perspectives.\n4.1.8  Agriculture\
    \ Monitoring\nArshad et al., [99] proposed a private blockchain-based \nsecure\
    \ access control for agriculture to monitor climatic \nparameters. Private Blockchain\
    \ access control (PBAC) was \nused to guarantee secure communications where a\
    \ user usu-\nally goes through initialization, authentication, and revo-\ncation.\
    \ The farms monitoring system consists of the login \nphase, system setup phase,\
    \ user/farm professional registra-\ntion phase, password authentication and session\
    \ key agree-\nment phase, update or change phase, and addition of node \nphase.\
    \ The whole system stores access records and lessen \nthe computational and communication\
    \ overhead. Forbye, \nN. Bore, [118] proposed a model to improve the shortcom-\n\
    ings of existing digitized farming models through the AG-\nWallet System (AGWS).\
    \ The AGWS design consisted of (1) \ndigitizing the far demand–supply, (2) The\
    \ farm information \npipeline was to ensure secure storage and validate events\
    \ \nreceived from IoT, and (3) data analytic services that make \nthe information\
    \ visible to the participants. The system pro-\nposed by Osmanoglu et al., [119]\
    \ uses a blockchain-based \nyield estimation solution. Farmers can share the farming\
    \ \nplans for the upcoming harvesting season with other par-\nticipants, or learn\
    \ from other’s plans to review their plans. \nSmart contracts can be employed\
    \ by participants to share \ntheir yield commitments. The author improvised a\
    \ censor-\nship-resistant, tamper-proof, and immutable public ledger of \ntime-stamped\
    \ transactions.\n2447\nA Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain Technology\
    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n4.1.9  Farmers\nTalreja et al., (2020) [121] proposed\
    \ a farmer’s portal with \nthe help of blockchain technology and python to preserve\
    \ the \ncontract of trade between farmers and consumers. The farm-\ner’s portal\
    \ is a way to access farm activities. The proposed \nwork enhanced the degree\
    \ of participation, reduced inter-\nmediary cost, simplified process, provided\
    \ ease of selling \ncrops, and greater efficiency. The immutability of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology fortified farmers for getting a fair price for their \ncrops and\
    \ reduced operational costs. Abraham and Kumar, \n[120] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ data security system to \npreserve farmer’s data. The proposed work was based\
    \ on a \nprivate-permissioned blockchain for controlled participation, \nhyper\
    \ ledger fabric to support smart contracts, and system \ndesign to safely store\
    \ farm data. The widened blockchain \ndata helps farmer’s data to be accessed\
    \ by other participants \nwhich can allow the government to sanction schemes based\
    \ \non farmer’s data. Topart et al., [122] proposed an interoper-\nable ecosystem\
    \ of farmer’s consent management. The model \nused a permissioned blockchain to\
    \ allow only a specific \ngroup of people to access the services. The immutability\
    \ of \nconsent allows the data to be non-manipulative, distributed, \nsigned transactions,\
    \ and transparent. The consent verifica-\ntion for each data allows only valid\
    \ users to request data. \nThe model was proposed to respect the privacy, security,\
    \ \ntransparency, and consent of the farmer’s data.\n4.1.10  Incentivization\n\
    Blockchain has been using incentive mechanisms since bit-\ncoin to incentivize\
    \ miners, but recently many authors have \npresented ways of promoting work for\
    \ a reward. Incentives \nto promote sustainable agricultural practices by Giaffreda\
    \ \net al., [123]. Objectives include savings and increasing \nmarket value plus\
    \ monitoring the use of water in the fields. \nFarmers have been relying on satellite\
    \ data as it is a cheap \nsource of agricultural services. With the use of LPWAN\
    \ net-\nworks, accuracy in fields is increased along with a tensiom-\neter-a sensing\
    \ unit that is used to wirelessly communicate \nthe data related to the humidity\
    \ of the soil and a mini-meteo \nstation that is used to measure temperature,\
    \ air humidity, and \nair pressure. Smart contracts record the transactions from\
    \ the \ncalculated results in the cloud and release the incentives to \nthe farmer\
    \ according to their deal with the stakeholder. The \nproposal includes EnvCoins\
    \ as the incentives, which can be \nfurther used to buy technologies for sustainable\
    \ agricultural \npractices, for cash, or investment. Esmaeilian et al., [124]\
    \ \nproposed an incentive mechanism for green behavior such \nas waste disposal,\
    \ using re-furbished products, purchasing \nenergy-efficient products, saving\
    \ energy, recover, repair, \nand maintain. The tokens gained from sustainable\
    \ behav-\nior can be further used to access services on blockchain. \nIncentivization\
    \ can ameliorate some of the environmental \nissues in rural areas with the help\
    \ of rural people by moti-\nvating them to clean the areas. OpenLitterMap by S.\
    \ Lynch, \n[125] uses geospatial analysis to geotag various types of \nlitter.\
    \ It uses LitterCoins as an incentive mechanism for the \nproof of work. This\
    \ is to motivate people to submit correct \ndata. It also rewards for uploading\
    \ litter images from a new \nlocation. Apart from plastic and other homogenous\
    \ litter, a \nproposal to eliminate solid waste from small municipalities \nin\
    \ return for a reward is given by França et al., [148]. The \nprovision was to\
    \ change the original system from attack risk, \ndata loss, power outage, and\
    \ other such problems. The new \ndigitized system proves to be a handier as it\
    \ is in the form of \na mobile application. The reward for selling solid waste\
    \ to \nthe collecting agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocurrency sent \nto the\
    \ seller’s virtual wallet. This initiative led to comput-\nerization gains, information\
    \ integrity, and the use of crypto-\ncurrency. Additionally, in [128] D. Zhang,\
    \ worked on a simi-\nlar solution to efficiently use rural waste in incentivizing\
    \ \nrural people. The process includes the installation of smart \nbins and when\
    \ they are full, the collection trucks will swap \nthe waste for a digital coupon\
    \ which the farmer can use to \neither get agricultural products from the waste\
    \ to the energy \nplant or cash them. Blockchain makes it an easier process to\
    \ \ntransfer and record data faster with maximum transparency. \nOther applications\
    \ of incentives for waste include Recereum, \nSwachhCoin, Plastic Bank, 4New,\
    \ and OILSC [129].\nThe motivational incentive mechanism can also transform \n\
    the way medical data is shared for research and diagnosis. In \nthe paper by Zhu\
    \ et al., [126], the authors gave a solution to \nactuate people into sharing\
    \ medical data by providing them \nrewards for doing so. The rewards system is\
    \ based on the \naccess provided by the owner of the medical file. Through \n\
    Smart contracts, a trusted payment money flow can be \ndevised between the third\
    \ party and the owner. The Shapley \nvalue was considered for the revenue distribution\
    \ of medi-\ncal data sharing and to study the impact of consensus on \nthe miner’s\
    \ income. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism \nfor the accident alert system,\
    \ proposed by Devi and Pamila, \n[127] is another blockchain-based medical application.\
    \ \nAccording to the authors, most of the accidents occurs near \nrural places\
    \ where medical help is unreachable on time. To \neliminate the privacy issue\
    \ of the nearby user who receives \nthe accident report, a blockchain-based incentive\
    \ method \nis implemented for the user who receives the accident alert \nto send\
    \ the location of the victim to a close-by emergency \nservice. Then the message\
    \ initiator gets rewarded incen-\ntives for alerting about the accident. A similar\
    \ report system \nmobile application for anonymous reporting is proposed by \n\
    Zou et al., [130] in which reporting any incident can earn \npeople rewards. The\
    \ design goal of the author was to imple-\nment an anonymous report system, to\
    \ provide privacy to the \nperson who reports, without having to give their personal\
    \ \n2448\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\ninformation to the system. This model\
    \ induces incentive \nnamed Rcoins to whoever published the report information,\
    \ \nthe repliers, and the consenting miners. The Blockchain and \nKudos by Sharples\
    \ and Dominigue, [131], a reward-based \npermanent solution as the digital record-keeping\
    \ model. The \nauthor proposed the use of blockchain to store digital certifi-\n\
    cates, achievements, and credits. Stored as a public record \nit can be accessed\
    \ by the institutions or the student online. \nThe model uses Kudos an educational\
    \ reputation currency \nas a reward. The reward can be earned through uploading\
    \ \ncertificates on the blockchain, passing a test, or on course \ncompletion.\
    \ Another application of blockchain-based incen-\ntive system is EduCTX by Turkanović\
    \ et al., [132] which \nis proposed to globally enable the higher education credit\
    \ \nplatform. For potential stakeholders such as educational \ninstitutions, companies,\
    \ and organizations a unified view \nof student’s higher education credits and\
    \ grading system \nis placed on the global ledger through blockchain. ECTX \n\
    tokens will be credited based on the completion of courses \nwhich will act as\
    \ proof of completed courses.\n4.2  Environment\nIn the environment sector, the\
    \ most emphasis was given \non blockchain applications in Natural hazards, Water,\
    \ and \nWaste management in rural areas (Fig. 15). A detailed sum-\nmary is given\
    \ in Table 8.\n4.2.1  Waste Management\nFrom the articles proposed, in D. Zhang,\
    \ [128] the author \nworked on a similar solution to efficiently use rural waste\
    \ \nin incentivizing rural people. This framework is based on \nChina’s Yitong\
    \ system which is waste to energy plant for \nagricultural waste and the use of\
    \ blockchain to provide digi-\ntal coupons or cryptocurrency in return for waste.\
    \ The author \nproposed the use of a web application to use a QR code \nscanner\
    \ when the waste is collected from a smart bin, also \nencouraging segregation\
    \ of agricultural waste and residential \nwaste. The serves receive the weight\
    \ of waste, lodges it on \nthe global ledger, and the coupon is rewarded based\
    \ on the \nweight. Apart from plastic and other homogenous litter, a \nproposal\
    \ to eliminate solid waste from small municipali-\nties in return for a reward\
    \ is given by França et al., [148]. \nThe provision was to change the original\
    \ system from attack \nrisk, data loss, power outage, and other such problems.\
    \ The \nnew digitized system proves to be a handier as it is in the \nform of\
    \ a mobile application. The reward for selling solid \nwaste to the collecting\
    \ agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocur-\nrency sent to the seller’s virtual wallet.\
    \ This initiative led to \ncomputerization gains, information integrity, and the\
    \ use of \ncrypto-currency.\nLatif et al., [133] have addressed the smart waste\
    \ manage-\nment system with the integration of IoT and blockchain. The \nproposed\
    \ model included identification of waste material, \ntrace location, send to trash,\
    \ categorize waste, transfer waste, \nrecycling, and decision-making process.\
    \ The sensor nodes \nin the model were used for waste identification, and adding\
    \ \nnew blocks and the admin and waste management offices \nwere responsible for\
    \ collecting, executing recycling, and \ndelivering products. The recyclable wastes\
    \ are transformed \ninto useful products and share with the customers and send\
    \ \nthe non-recyclable wastes to the trash.\nFig.15  Blockchain applications \n\

    \ \nIrrigation water companies release the water reports based \non which the\
    \ smart contracts execute the claims to the farm-\ners. Deployment of the system\
    \ can ensure water supply in \nrural areas and accessibility of insurance in case\
    \ of droughts \nor floods.\n4.2.3  Water Management\nThe intelligent smart watering\
    \ system proposed by Munir \net al., [135] is a blockchain-based system for the\
    \ smart \nconsumption of water. The system uses IoT for capturing \nreal-time\
    \ environment conditions such as soil moisture \nlevel, light intensity, air humidity,\
    \ and air temperature. The \nmain focus of the proposed system was to develop\
    \ a healthy \necosystem while efficiently using water in plantations and \ngardening.\
    \ Forbye, A water control system to efficiently \nmanage and coordinate the use\
    \ of water in irrigation com-\nmunities is proposed by Bordel et al., [136]. The\
    \ prosumer \nenvironment in the model is composed of a rule definition \nmodule\
    \ where users can create irrigation recipes using ECA \n(Event-Condition-Action)\
    \ rules. These rules are executable \nand easily transformed into other programming\
    \ languages. \nInputs are taken by a transformation engine, to create, com-\n\
    pile, and deploy a set of Smart Contracts coding all the irri-\ngation and management\
    \ logic. Finally, irrigation recipes are \nexecuted by an execution engine, which\
    \ invokes deployed \nSmart Contracts to interact with the infrastructure. From\
    \ \nthe perspective of Dogo et al., [137] proposed convergence \nof IoT and Blockchain.\
    \ Objectives of smart water solutions \ninclude smart measuring and monitoring\
    \ across the water \ndistribution, enhanced security, better analysis of the gener-\n\
    ated data, and enhanced revenue and efficiency.\nSimilarly, Hassija et al., [138]\
    \ proposed a drone-mounted \nbase station in the tactile internet environment\
    \ based on \nblockchain. The drone-mounted small cell station was based \non a\
    \ Permissioned peer-to-peer blockchain. To take strategic \ndecisions, a game\
    \ theory model was deployed. The deci-\nsion was based on user association; transmit\
    \ power level, \ndrone speed, and altitude. Additionally, smart contracts can\
    \ \nadd parameters and conditions based on requirements. The \nmodel’s results\
    \ showed that the low network areas can expe-\nrience better bandwidth with the\
    \ proposed system.\nFurther, the proposed model by Pincheira et al., [139] pre-\n\
    sented a trustless water management system-based software \narchitecture. The\
    \ system proposed presented a decentralized \nwater management system that could\
    \ incentivize virtuous \nbehavior in agricultural practices. Smart contracts were\
    \ used \nfor their intermediary-less characteristic. The authors also \nimplemented\
    \ a cross-platform software library to allow con-\nstrained devices to interact\
    \ with blockchain directly. The \nFig. 16  Blockchain applications \nin Smart\

    \ and the use of \nrenewable energy were mainly focused on in the articles. \n\
    Enescu et al., [140] proposed a study on the use of photovol-\ntaic energy. The\
    \ paper showed the use of photovoltaic panels \nto power a power plant for the\
    \ improvement of abandoned \nland. According to the authors, photovoltaic panels\
    \ can eas-\nily pump water and is a more appropriate use of solar energy. \nBlockchain\
    \ can help reduce the intermediary distributors \nhence making the selling and\
    \ buying of energy more profit-\nable. Additionally, Kulkarni and Kulkarni, [141],\
    \ consider-\ning the lack of electricity in rural India, proposed a model to \n\
    solve rural electrification problems. The model introduces \npeer-to-peer energy\
    \ trading through blockchain suitable for \nsmall and remote micro-grids. A reliable\
    \ and profitable elec-\ntricity supply can be obtained through micro-grids. Smart\
    \ \ncontract-based meters allow transparency in the daily usage \nof energy used\
    \ hence encouraging rural people into investing \nin blockchain-based electrification.\n\
    4.3.2  Renewable Energy\nLevi-Oguike et al., [142] have presented the challenges\
    \ and \nmodalities for the adoption of blockchain technologies and \nto ensure\
    \ energy efficiency as an advancement to the sub-\nSaharan Africa environment.\
    \ In the case study performed \nby the authors, the following factors affected\
    \ its use to a \nlarge extent in sub-Saharan Africa: Employment and edu-\ncation,\
    \ displacement and resettlement, financing the tech-\nnology, regulatory provisions,\
    \ operational modalities, and \nparanoia and wariness. The overall objective of\
    \ the paper \nwas to ensure that the sub-Saharan region was involved in \nthe\
    \ innovative and industrial revolution wave. From Krajna-\nkova et al., [143]\
    \ author’s perspective following Scientific \ninduction and deduction were made:\
    \ The proposed Bio-\nmass blockchain structure is based on the use of traditional\
    \ \nresources but the transactions are processed exclusively in a \ndigital environment.\
    \ The user can know the precise amount \nof energy and time when it is transferred\
    \ to the consumer \nalso ensuring real-time payment for the energy. According\

    \ in banking availability in rural areas, loan sanctions \nto under-documented\
    \ people, and methods of transferring \nmoney (Fig. 17). A detailed summary is\
    \ given in Table 10.\n4.4.1  Loan\nGuo et al., [151] proposed a novel poverty\
    \ alleviation loan \nmanagement called the Loan On Blockchain (LoC). In the \n\
    LoC, the participating roles can be named as the Financial \ndepartment to check\
    \ the identity and application informa-\ntion of the participants, bank to provide\
    \ loan to the cus-\ntomer, Customer to provide identity and apply for loan, civil\
    \ \naffairs department to audit the customer identity and loan \napplications,\
    \ Regulator to monitor fund flow and inspect \nledger. This digital account model\
    \ was proposed for decen-\ntralized and centralized transfer of assets. Similarly,\
    \ Jain \net al., [152] presented a solution named Bit-score for credit \nscoring\
    \ for underprivileged (rural) people with the help of \nblockchain. The authors’\
    \ model used a self-sovereign model \nfor identity, distributed ledger storage,\
    \ credit score calcula-\ntion without any extra charges, and non-financial factor\
    \ for \nacquiring credit score. With bit-score being an improvisation \nover traditional\
    \ credit scoring techniques it makes the \ntransactions more transparent, decentralized,\
    \ secure, and \nintermediary-free.\n4.4.2  Mobile Money\nY. Hu, [150] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based digital payment \nsystem to deliver reliable services on\
    \ unreliable network \nservices in rural areas. The system management contract\
    \ \nto record account types, user balances to avoid forks dur-\ning disconnection\
    \ with the help of smart contracts. True \ntransparency can be obtained through\
    \ digitization and eco-\nnomic growth can be boosted in poor countries. Ghatpande\
    \ \net al., [149] proposed a way of moving Secure, interoperable \nmobile money\
    \ in sub-Saharan Africa (SIGMMA) to sup-\nport semi-offline payments through blockchain.\
    \ The model \nprovides unreachable areas a monetary transaction solution \nwithout\
    \ having to provide any identity proof while ensuring \ntrust between parties\
    \ along with not having to physically \nvisit any bank.\n4.4.3  Cash Transfer\n\
    Another proposal is to provide banking solutions to rural \nareas where a chit\
    \ fund system has been designed by Kumar \nand Sangal, [154]. Chit fund being\
    \ a traditional saving \nscheme in India is an easier way to have access to credit.\

    \ To \nensure the privacy of medical data which contains most of \nthe private\
    \ information blockchain distributed data storage \nfor heterogeneous data was\
    \ proposed having a single source \nfor data storage and access while providing\
    \ high security \nand privacy to the users and researchers. Similarly, Zhang \n\
    et al., [158] proposed secure and scalable clinical data shar-\ning using FHIR\
    \ Chain, a blockchain-based system meeting \nONC (office of the national coordinator\
    \ for health informa-\ntion technology) requirements. The technical requirements\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based clinical data sharing were verifying \nidentity and authenticating\
    \ all participants, Storing and \nexchanging data securely, consistent Permissioned\
    \ access \nto data sources, applying consistent data formats, maintain-\ning modularity.\
    \ FHIRChain facilitates clinical data exchange \nwhile maintaining ownership.\n\
    4.5.2  Telemedicine\nGuo et al., [161] proposed an ABE scheme to achieve \ndynamic\
    \ authentication and authorization with higher flex-\nibility and efficiency for\
    \ the Medical on Demand services \nin the telemedicine system. The system uses\
    \ a Consor-\ntium Blockchain managed by multiple authorities. Medi-\ncal examinations\
    \ are uploaded to the database provided \nby Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The\
    \ medical results are \ndownloadable from Cloud only by Medical specialists. All\
    \ \nthe data is stored in Blocks of Blockchain hence prevent-\ning any manipulation\
    \ in health records. Through this system \nindependence of choice should be provided\
    \ to the patient \nwhether they want to enroll, leave, or change access poli-\n\
    cies. Nusrat et al., [160] proposed a model of a telemedicine \nsystem for medical\
    \ care and security of data of rural people \nby using blockchain technology.\
    \ The system consisted of sta-\ntions for primary treatment tests while storing\
    \ data directly \nin the blockchain. This system ensured communication and \n\
    data privacy to doctors and patients while also giving reli-\nable medical care\
    \ and benefits to underserved (rural) people.\nForbye, Yong et al., [159] have\
    \ proposed a blockchain \nand machine learning system for vaccine supply chain\
    \ trace-\nability. The novel intelligent system based on the blockchain \ncan\
    \ be used for vaccine supervision in the vaccine supply \nchain. Additionally,\
    \ using smart contracts for the vaccine \nsupply chain can provide the following\
    \ advantages: detection \nof expired vaccines, vaccine information, and vaccine\
    \ coin.\n4.5.3  Smart Healthcare System\nMachine Learning holds the power to change\
    \ the perception \nof understanding and analyzing data and decision-making in\
    \ \nmultifarious sectors. Since, the blockchain with its decen-\ntralized network\
    \ focus on secure data sharing, its integration \nwith machine learning would\
    \ provide a very meticulous out-\ncome. Few of the ways through which blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with machine learning and benefit the healthcare system \nare\
    \ [162]:\n(a) Blockchain ledger with legitimate data collection can \nfeed the\
    \ machine learning models with highly accurate \nand dependable data.\n(b) Real\
    \ data can be used to train machine learning models \nto increase efficiency and\
    \ precision, therefore, saving \ncost and time.\n(c) Models can be trained to\
    \ give the same health advice \nto multiple patients with alike symptoms.\n(d)\
    \ Models can also be trained to give better clinical solu-\ntions to doctors based\
    \ on the patient’s symptoms.\n(e) Training the models on the patient history and\
    \ storing \nthem on blockchain ledger can predict outbreaks.\nFor implementing\
    \ the integration, Jain et al., [156] pro-\nposed an integrated model of blockchain\
    \ and machine learn-\ning to detect diseases. These models can be implemented\
    \ \nin a hospital or rural medical camps. The proposed system \nconsisted of IoT,\
    \ blockchain, cybersecurity, and machine \nlearning. Various components measure\
    \ basic parameters of \nthe human body such as weight, pulse, blood pressure,\
    \ and \nautomatically saved the data in the ledger. The system has \nthe potential\
    \ to expand medical parameters while making it \n2456\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\nadaptive. The complete system can collect, store, and ana-\nlyze the\
    \ data of the patient and benefit the doctors, patients, \nand medical institutions.\n\
    Similarly, Tripathi et al., [155] have proposed a safe and \nconvenient use of\
    \ medical data and its user through block-\nchain technology. The proposed work\
    \ is an improvement \non issues and challenges faced regarding security and pri-\n\
    vacy. The clinical data are recorded in the blockchain ledger \nwith access to\
    \ legitimate users only. For a doctor to access \na patient’s data a request has\
    \ to be made and only when \nthe patient approves the request does the data become\
    \ vis-\nible. The goal of this model is to provide secure and reliable \nservices\
    \ to insurance companies, drug supply chains, and \nmedical researchers. Lastly.\n\
    4.6  Employment\nThis application area mainly focused on employment vis-\nibility\
    \ and temporary employment for rural job security \n(Fig. 19). Therefore, the\
    \ following related research articles \nwere identified and a detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 12.\n4.6.1  Temporary Employment\nPinna and Ibba, [163] proposed\
    \ a decentralized employment \nsystem to process employment contracts with a fully\
    \ auto-\nmated and fast procedure. The model consists of a new job \noffer event\
    \ in which awaiting employers apply for jobs, an \napplication event where a smart\
    \ contract acquires the appli-\ncation request, a hiring event where the applicant\
    \ worker \nmeets the employer, a relationship event to enable the work-\ners to\
    \ check working situation and details, the workday event \nwhich describes the\
    \ maturation of workdays, a payment \nevent where the employee gets paid. The\
    \ transparent ledger \ncan make sure that the employment contracts were deployed\
    \ \nwith unchangeable information.\n4.6.2  Employment Visibility\nSimilarly, the\
    \ paper’s proposal by M. et al., [164] ensures \nsupply chain visibility to seamlessly\
    \ connect all stakeholders \nof the supply chain network who are a part of the\
    \ Blockchain \necosystem. The paper defined two modules in BC design: the \nSupply\
    \ module and the demand module. Supply module to \ncollect worker's data and smart\
    \ contracts to perform transac-\ntions through an application interface and store\
    \ them on the \nledger. Demand module to implement job allocation. The \naggregators\
    \ are given direct access to help track worker’s \ninformation from the ledger.\n\
    4.7  Existing Systematic Literature Reviews\nA tabular representation of a few\
    \ major existing works of \nblockchain in rural development has been done in Table 13.\
    \ \nThis table communicates the area of literature reviews, and \ntheir main contributions\
    \ in the review regarding blockchain \nin rural or agriculture.\nAn extensive\
    \ literature review was done in this section \nwhich portrayed the enormous amount\
    \ of work done in \nblockchain technology pertaining to rural development. All\
    \ \nthe functional areas and sub-areas were compared and dis-\ncussed in tabular\
    \ form. Multiple novel ideas and theories \nwere identified during the literature\
    \ review. At last, a small \ntabular representation was made for the existing\
    \ systematic \nliterature reviews and surveys in a similar area to identify the\
    \ \ndepth of the work done. In the upcoming sections, critical \nanalysis and\
    \ detailed discussion have been done based on \nthe literature study, followed\
    \ by the limitations of the survey \nand conclusion.\nFig. 19  Blockchain applications\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n5  Critical Analysis Existing Technologies \nand Discussion\n\
    Blockchain Technology possesses much competence and \nfuturistic hold towards\
    \ rural development. In this review, \nall possible applications of blockchain\
    \ that facilitated rural \ndevelopment were found, reviewed, compared, and summa-\n\
    rized. With Agriculture being the predominant application \nof blockchain, various\
    \ areas under it were analyzed that \nworked on the relief of agricultural issues\
    \ in rural areas.\nStarting with Supply chain traceability, the study showed \n\
    integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things \n[51, 54, 56, 58,\
    \ 63, 64, 69, 70, 73, 76, 82, 84, 85, 89, 100, \n145], Cloud computing [65, 87],\
    \ Big Data [87], and Geo-\nspatial Technology [100]. Among the papers discussed,\
    \ this \narea consisted of papers pertinent to tracing agricultural \nproduce\
    \ from the beginning of the process till it reached \nthe consumer. The range\
    \ of traceability options comprised \nall agricultural products as well as specifically\
    \ certain prod-\nucts such as soybean [60], grape wine [69], and cocoa beans \n\
    [62]. Furthermore, blockchain’s integration with IoT pro-\nvided sensing and sharing\
    \ of private data with blockchain \nwithout intermediary support. Additionally,\
    \ some proposed \nwork used QR codes [56, 60, 146] for viewing data directly \n\
    related to the attached product. Articles supporting IoT \ndevices were implemented\
    \ for tracing agricultural produce, \nencouraging circular economy, fault-tolerant,\
    \ and immutable \nAPIs. A few were reviews on agriculture traceability [53, \n\
    58, 60, 61] barriers [67], challenges [59, 71, 76] contribu-\ntion [80], IoT based\
    \ solutions, and future scopes [78, 96]. \nSome agricultural prototypes included\
    \ AgriBlockIoT [70], \nKHET [83], and FARMAR [68]. A few land record manage-\n\
    ment articles were also discussed that implied security and \nbroker-free methods\
    \ for land titling and transferring [97, 98]. \nMost of the platforms used were\
    \ Ethereum Smart Contracts, \nHyperledger, REST, JavaScript (Web3, node, angular),\
    \ Truf-\nfle Framework APIs, and MySQL and MongoDB for cloud \nstorage.\nWhile\
    \ traceability of agricultural produce is important, \nthe agriculture security\
    \ system is also a necessity. In this \nreview, the articles for agriculture security\
    \ systems included \nprevention of farm data from cyber-attacks using IoT [103]\
    \ \nand supervision of agricultural products and food informa-\ntion [102]. In\
    \ both the works acquired, it used Smart con-\ntracts and Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ respectively, along with \nIoT-based sensors for farm monitoring.\nOrganic Farming\
    \ as a part of agriculture application for \nsustainable farming and quality food\
    \ production included \ntwo articles for analyzing the effectiveness of supply\
    \ chain \n[101], and identifying product quality and transparency of \norganic\
    \ food supply chain using decentralized applications \nand QR codes for tracing\
    \ product data [104].\nTable 12  Comparison of blockchain applications in Employment\n\

    Furthermore, using smart methods to enhance the agri-\ncultural process was discusses\
    \ in the smart agriculture \nSect. 3.1.4 where farm controlling, recordkeeping,\
    \ improved \nlogistics, farm managing and improvising, and monitoring \nusing\
    \ Blockchain Technology and IoT [106–110] as well \nas cloud computing [105] and\
    \ geospatial technology [100] \nin some articles were covered. Most emphases were\
    \ given \ntowards improving the quality of farming and its man-\nagement while\
    \ providing utmost security to data. Mostly \nused platforms to implement the\
    \ proposed work were \nJavaScript(Node, Ganache, Truffle), Ethereum Smart Con-\n\
    tracts, and IoT-based sensors.\nApart from the supply chain in farming, the dairy\
    \ sector \nwas one of the application areas covered in the review com-\nprising\
    \ of E-governance in the dairy sector implemented on \nsmart contracts [111],\
    \ and quality and quantity assurance \nof milk with a delivery platform [112]\
    \ using Blockchain \nTechnology. In addition to the dairy sector, blockchain appli-\n\
    cations in livestock management using Blockchain Technol-\nogy [114], IoT and\
    \ Cloud Computing [113, 115, 147] to \nmonitor livestock, observe cattle using\
    \ RFID tags, storing \ndetailed information on fishes, along with livestock trace-\n\
    ability were discussed in the review. Integration with IoT \nprovided real-time\
    \ monitoring and traceability of livestock \nand its by-products in the supply\
    \ chain.\nSimilarly, to share informative farming data and tech-\nniques a review\
    \ on convenience analysis of the blockchain \nin agriculture [116], and exploratory\
    \ data planning and \nmanagement of agricultural food supply chain for sustain-\n\
    able development [117] was given to explore the work done \nin E-agriculture using\
    \ blockchain technology. Since one \nof the main motives towards implementing\
    \ blockchain in \nagriculture is to monitor the faring process and products \n\
    till it reaches the consumer, therefore, agriculture monitor-\ning section covered\
    \ farm monitoring system[99], a yield \nestimation system to share farming plans\
    \ implemented on \nsmart contracts [119], and an IoT based AG Wallet system to\
    \ \ntrack farm activity implemented using IBM enterprise block-\nchain platform\
    \ [118]. Penultimately, the application area was \ndivided into farmer Sect. 3.1.9\
    \ where blockchain’s reviews \nto facilitate farmers such as farmer’s portal to\
    \ capture farm \nactivities using HTML and Python [121], farmer’s data stor-\n\
    age to provide transparency for government scheme using \nsmart contracts [120],\
    \ and farmer’s data accessing using \ntheir consent [122] were discussed.\nLastly,\
    \ an overall blockchain application area covering the \nuse of incentives for\
    \ numerous activities was discussed in \nSect. 3.1.10. The review included a reward-based\
    \ system in \nreturn for solid waste [148], rural waste [128], anonymously \n\
    reporting an activity [130], reporting an accident [127], stor-\ning educational\
    \ records in ledger [132], green behavior [123, \n124], geotagging litters [125],\
    \ and to safely share medical \ndata [126]. The incentive mechanism works when\
    \ an activ-\nity is performed, therefore in return for good behaviors or \nactivity,\
    \ cryptocurrency-based tokens are rewarded that can \nbe stored in a blockchain\
    \ wallet. Most of the platforms used \nwere smart contracts while some of the\
    \ systems also used \nARK Blockchain, Laravel PHP, and JavaScript.\nLooking through\
    \ the applications of blockchain in rural \nareas, usage of blockchain in reinforcing\
    \ environmental \nconditions and changing people's outlook on preserving the \n\
    environment was the outcome of factors affecting rural peo-\nple as they were\
    \ much likely also related to environmental \nconditions. From this view, the\
    \ environmental application \nareas were discovered and discussed to be Water\
    \ manage-\nment, Waste management, and Natural hazards.\nTo begin with, under\
    \ Sect. 3.2.3 water management, \nsmart measuring and monitoring [137], smart\
    \ consump-\ntion [135], management [139], and control system [136] \nof water\
    \ were discussed. These articles provided smart \nways of implementing blockchain\

    \ system in return for waste collection and selling \n[128, 148], and waste management\
    \ [133] using Blockchain \nTechnology were discussed. Covered under the integration\
    \ \nof Blockchain Technology, Cloud Computing, and IoT, the \nimplementation used\
    \ smart contracts in the first two propos-\nals and UML, TLA + for the latter.\n\
    Lastly, as per the research criteria, only one article con-\ntributing to the\
    \ environment and natural hazards was dis-\ncovered and reviewed explaining the\
    \ insurance system for \ndrought-affected farms based on the farm data stored\
    \ in the \nblockchain ledger [134]. The model was implemented on \nNEO virtual\
    \ machine, smart contracts, and used Oracle \nserver as database.\nSimilarly,\
    \ from the challenges faced by rural people \nacquiring an electric line, energy-efficient\
    \ methods, to \nsecure, and transparent payments issues were covered and \nreviewed\
    \ under the energy section. The blockchain applica-\ntion areas in the energy\
    \ sector were discovered to be Renew-\nable energy and the Energy grid. With blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with renewable energy a smart contract-based energy \ntransfer\
    \ credibility system of biomass energy grid [143], \nand a case study of sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa and its challenges \nand adoption of renewable energy access were discussed\
    \ \n[142]. Whereas in the energy grid section, the blockchain’s \napplication\
    \ in providing peer-to-peer electrification with \nsecure payments, transparent\
    \ energy usage [144], and the \nuse of smart energy grids for farming and irrigation\
    \ using \nEthereum Blockchain [140] were reviewed.\nBesides, from the traditional\
    \ use of blockchain in Finance, \nthe banking solutions for rural people were\
    \ discussed in \nSect. 3.4. From the banking applications of blockchain, the \n\
    use of mobile money for semi-offline payments in sub-Saha-\nran Africa without\
    \ identity proof using a secure, interoper-\nable mobile money system [149], and\
    \ a delay-tolerant digital \npayment system based on Ethereum blockchain [150]\
    \ were \ndiscussed. A simpler way of getting a loan with the help \nof blockchain\
    \ is by using a hyper ledger fabric-based Loan \nOn Blockchain(LOC) system using\
    \ smart contracts [151], \nand a credit scoring system called Bit-score using\
    \ Ethereum \nBlockchain [152] were discussed. Finally, a Cash Transfer \narea\
    \ where a distributed system for automatic subsidy deliv-\nery and fund release\
    \ using JavaScript and Hyperledger com-\nposer [153], and a chit fund system based\
    \ on smart contracts \nto provide credit to rural people [154] were reviewed.\n\
    Under the Healthcare applications of blockchain, A Smart \nHealthcare System,\
    \ Medical Data sharing, and Telemedi-\ncine were the areas discovered. Under smart\
    \ healthcare, the \narticles reviewed were a smart model to detect diseases and\
    \ \nmeasure basic health parameters using Ethereum blockchain \nand Raspberry\
    \ Pi [156] and protected access to medical \ndata using smart contracts [155].\
    \ For the recordkeeping of \nmedical data and share it legitimately an electronic\
    \ medi-\ncal record storage management system based on ethereum \nand cloud storage\
    \ [157], and a permissioned clinical data \nsharing called FHIRChain using smart\
    \ contracts [158] was \nreviewed. Lastly, under Telemedicine, vaccine supervision\
    \ \nand traceability for safe vaccine supply [159], secure data \nstorage using\
    \ telemedicine system based on smart contracts \n[160], and a telemedicine system\
    \ to prevent health records \nmanipulation using Blockchain and Cloud Database\
    \ [161] \nwere the articles reviewed.\nAnother challenge faced by rural people\
    \ implemented to \nrecuperate from unemployment using blockchain technol-\nogy\
    \ was discussed in Sect. 3.6. Using smart contracts an \nemployment contracts\
    \ processing, handling, and safe pay-\nment system for temporary employment contracts\
    \ [163], and \na blockchain aggregator to perform worker data transactions \n\
    and employment visibility [164] were the works reviewed \nin this section.\n5.1\
    \  Limitations of Existing Works and Research \nGaps\nIn this section, the limitations\
    \ of the existing literature \nreview on blockchain in rural development along\
    \ with \na comparison of existing systematic literature reviews \nhave been discussed.\
    \ The comparison has been shown in \nTable 14, and a few research gaps have been\
    \ mentioned in \nthis section as well.\nWhile Blockchain technology is leading\
    \ in security and \ntransparency, providing ways of applying its technology in\
    \ \ndisparate areas its limitations and gaps can still be identi-\nfied in the\
    \ proposed and implemented work. While most \nof the work in agriculture is for\
    \ ensuring transparency and \ntraceability in the supply chain, there are far\
    \ more factors in \nagriculture that affect farmers and crops. Blockchain inevi-\n\
    tably uses excessive energy in execution, but its execution in \nrural areas may\
    \ become worrisome due to the lack of energy \nand load in those areas.\nCollecting\
    \ farm data and storing them on the ledger in \nsmall farms is easier. However,\
    \ in the case of big farms, the \ndata collection and integration may consume\
    \ much time and \nprobably manpower in accumulating and loading it in the \nledger.\
    \ Apart from that, IoT-based services require sensors \nas well as collecting\
    \ livestock DNA to trace them and load \ntheir information may cost a fortune\
    \ to small-scale farmers.\nTeaching the application usage to laymen, that too\
    \ unedu-\ncated farmers or rural people may become a troubling task. \nNot only\
    \ that, the availability of news of the latest technolo-\ngies is hardly accessible\
    \ to underdeveloped countries, intro-\nducing blockchain-based applications to\
    \ those areas may toil \nthe deployment and utilization.\n2460\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\

    \ pertaining to rural areas have been addressed \nby authors with the help of\
    \ blockchain. Agriculture is the \nmost economic factor, solutions for blockchain-based\
    \ sup-\nply chain traceability provided secure, transparent, beneficial \nproduct\
    \ delivery. It also ensured timely payments to farm-\ners and quality products\
    \ to consumers. Banking solutions \nhave also been made easier with blockchain\
    \ technology, pro-\nviding remote banking solutions, credit and loan easiness,\
    \ \nand easy and transparent banking. Hygiene issues that led \nto many diseases,\
    \ generational disabilities have also been \ngiven a solution through blockchain\
    \ which also incentivizes \nrural people for participating in waste and water\
    \ manage-\nment. Rural electrification solutions were also proposed with \nblockchain\
    \ for people unable to obtain energy resources, \nbasic electrical amenities,\
    \ and expensive bills. People who \nwere unable to receive treatments, had to\
    \ travel long dis-\ntances for medical assistance, were also provided a block-\n\
    chain solution with which telemedicine, privacy to medical \ndata usage, and medical-on-demand\
    \ were made available. \nBlockchain has also been useful in providing employment\
    \ \nsolutions to the truly underserved, using a global chain \nfor employment\
    \ visibility, and secure payment for jobs \n[168–172].\nThe Systematic Literature\
    \ Review’s objective is to pro-\nvide information on the research proposed related\
    \ to block-\nchain in rural development to provide new research oppor-\ntunities,\
    \ extensive knowledge about each development area, \nand the possibility for future\
    \ development in rural areas. \nAfter distinctly reviewing every research article\
    \ variant areas \nof applications were identified relating to the development\
    \ of \nFig. 20  Blockchain Applications and their Areas in rural development\n\
    2462\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nrural areas with the help of Blockchain Technology.\
    \ Overall, \n6 disparate applications in rural development were picked \nout;\
    \ from which each of these applications has a total of 23 \ndivergent areas combined.\
    \ These areas contribute to all the \nresearch that has been done in the blockchain\
    \ in the rural \ndevelopment sector and are distributed across 37 countries \n\
    obtained from 6 journals and 1 web source ranging from \nthe years 2010 to 2020.\
    \ After searching through journals, \napplying more than 16 keywords, 112 articles\
    \ were found in \naggregate. From analyzing each article, the primary applica-\n\
    tion of blockchain was identified as agriculture with 67% of \nresearch articles\
    \ relative to blockchain in agriculture whence \n60% were associated with supply\
    \ chain traceability. About \n55% of those papers were from the Institute of Electrical\
    \ and \nElectronics Engineers (IEEE). Furthermore, in 112 research \npapers, 8\
    \ technologies were implemented with a total of 58 \nplatforms and tools combined.\n\
    5.3  Research Questions Addressed\nFrom the Research Questions defined (Table 3),\
    \ the follow-\ning inference can be made:\nRQ1 What are the main applications\
    \ and areas of imple-\nmenting Blockchain Technology in Rural Development?\nVarious\
    \ extensively researched applications are defined \nin Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\
    \ 11 and 12. These applications \ndefine the Blockchain’s applications in rural\
    \ development \nthat impact the rural areas, provide security, opportunities,\
    \ \navailability of resources, and a better lifestyle. The areas \n(Fig. 20) gave\
    \ extensive knowledge about the domains of \napplication-defined from several\
    \ research articles related to \nit.\nRQ2 What are the major issues in Rural Development\
    \ and \nhow they can be addressed using Blockchain Technology?\nNumerous issues\
    \ in rural areas are explained in Sect. 1.1.1 \nand the blockchain applications\
    \ for the eradication of those \nissues are addressed in Sect. 3.\nRQ3 What are\
    \ the targeted software, platforms, and tools \nfor the implementation of blockchain\
    \ in rural development?\nThroughout the applications, for implementation follow-\n\
    ing (Table 15) technologies’ integration, and software and \nplatforms were used:\n\
    RQ4.  What are the research gaps and future research direc-\ntions for applying\
    \ blockchain technology to rural \ndevelopment?\nFollowing the review, in agriculture,\
    \ most emphases were \nstated towards supply chain traceability and less or no\
    \ work \nin natural resource management, overproduction, yield stag-\nnation,\
    \ and international trade. In regards to the sociological \nfactor, research on\
    \ work belonging to blockchain develop-\nment for rural education, housing, women\
    \ empowerment, \ncrime reduction, brain drain, and craftsmanship is missing. \n\
    For the implementation of banking, healthcare, and many \nother applications the\
    \ required government and technologi-\ncal assist are still lacking. In some cases,\
    \ the research pro-\nposed could be administered only in the far future, therefore\
    \ \ncontemporary work was absent. Some more gaps and future \nresearch directions\
    \ are given in Sects. 4.2 and 6.1.\nThe research questions mentioned in Table \
    \ 3 are \naddressed in the following section (Table 16):\n6  Threat to Validity\
    \ and Limitation \nof the Survey\nWhile reviewing the issues in rural areas, blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology, and the applications of blockchain technology in \nrural development\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n2.3. During exclusion, some articles were not considered\
    \ fit \nfor this review, were missed, or were not found. Six appli-\ncations were\
    \ considered in this review, there could be more \napplications that we couldn’t\
    \ figure or that couldn’t make the \ncut of criteria. A total of 23 sub-areas\
    \ of all the applications \nwere determined. Conclusively, as per our knowledge,\
    \ there \nwasn’t any systematic review that reviewed all the applica-\ntion areas\
    \ of blockchain technology in rural and sustainable \ndevelopment nevertheless\
    \ there could have been a few rural \nand sustainable development articles that\
    \ weren’t included \nin this review.\n7  Conclusion and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ Technology has presented a considerable amount \nof work in the rural sector.\
    \ While its implementation was \nfew, the ideology is enough to motivate people\
    \ into changing \nthe lifestyle of rural people leading to the overall country’s\
    \ \ndevelopment. In this systematic literature review, numerous \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology in sustainable rural \ndevelopment were discussed with\
    \ diverse areas in each \napplication. A comparative study of each application\
    \ in all \nthe areas pertaining to different approaches has been por-\ntrayed\
    \ with differing attributes elucidating the technology, \nprocess, and techniques\
    \ behind each article. The paper pro-\nvides extensive literature towards each\
    \ of the articles sorted \nafter applying the review process consisting of relevant\
    \ arti-\ncles and keywords. The primary findings of the systematic \nliterature\
    \ review were as follows:\n(a) From the review, we were able to identify common\
    \ and \nexceptional uses of blockchain technology that would \nhelp uplift the\
    \ rural community and lead to sustainable \nrural development.\n(b) Various distinct\
    \ approaches to implementing block-\nchain technology for rural welfare were discovered.\n\
    (c) Platforms and tools that would facilitate the use of these \napplications\
    \ for farmers and uninstructed agrestic peo-\nple were identified and reviewed.\n\
    (d) Blockchain’s integration with multiple powerful tech-\nnologies for rural\
    \ development was reviewed.\n(e) An overall idea for a collaborative approach\
    \ leading to \na smart village framework was constructed.\nThe gaps determined\
    \ from reviewing the articles broadly \nwould help researchers explore additional\
    \ as well as alter-\nnative utilization of blockchain technology for sustainable\
    \ \nrural development.\n7.1  Future Work\nBlockchain’s characteristics are exceptionally\
    \ conducive to \nsafety, privacy, integrity, traceability, efficiency, and trans-\n\
    parency in every area limited by such advantages. While \ndiverse blockchain applications\
    \ for the welfare of rural \ncommunity has been discussed nevertheless future\
    \ work \ncan comprise of facilitating applications in making use of \nblockchain\
    \ incentives for a collaborative framework incor-\nporating several services in\
    \ rural areas namely Smart Vil-\nlage. Blockchain technology in terms of providing\
    \ incentive \nmechanisms could lead to a better motivational unit in many \nareas.\
    \ Incentivizing rural or urban people for education, data \nsharing, green farming,\
    \ green behavior, and environment \nconservation are real future demands. Apart\
    \ from empha-\nsizing rural areas, blockchain’s integration with network-\ning,\
    \ cybersecurity, and digital advertising is also a future \ninsistence.\nFunding\

    Standardization in the field of agro-geoinformation is imperative to support and
    simplify the sharing, usage and interoperability of agro-geoinformation of different
    sources. It is also a complex task that addresses multiple aspects encompassing
    data collection, data analysis, data management, system development, data sharing
    and information service. As such, a reference model is required to achieve this
    task in an integrated and consistent manner. The reference model for agro-geoinformation
    standards defined aim, emphasis, groups of standards and their relation. Using
    methods of system engineering and conceptual schema, this paper developed and
    brought forward a reference model for agro-geoinformation standards. The reference
    model consists of three levels - the base standard level, the general standard
    level, the profile and application standard level. The general standard consists
    of five groups including guidance standards, data or product standards, management
    standards, application system development standards and information service standards.
    The paper mainly set forth the standard composition and essentials of five groups.
    It put forward important principles and methods for building specific agricultural
    information standard profiles and application standards based on the base standard
    and the general standard. The reference model has guidance meaning for the field
    information standardization which focuses on information accumulation, application
    and service as well as establishment of agro-geoinformation standard system. Published

    IEEE Conference Location: Shanghai, China SECTION I. Introduction With the development
    of agricultural information construction and the wide application of information
    technology, higher requirements have put forward for effective, comprehensive
    and standards agricultural geographic information. It has become development trend
    to set up specialized, standard and shared data collection system, treatment system,
    management system and service system for agro-geoinformation. However, due to
    lack of standards, a large number of agricultural geographic information could
    only be used in internal information system. In order to improve data use efficiency,
    agro-geoinformation standard system was required to ensure interoperability and
    sharing of agro-geoinformation. Since multiple standards worked together to achieve
    the same purpose, the goal, methods as well as standard relationships for agro-geoinformation
    standardization should be put forward. Reference model for agro-geoinformation
    standard could do it. The reference model defines the framework of agro-geoinformation
    standardization, the relationship between standards and its contents. It is the
    basis of the standard system to guide the work of agro-geoinformation standardization.
    SECTION II. Progress of reference model for geographic information standards Agro-geoinformation
    belongs to the scope of geographic information. Therefore, it is important to
    understand the reference model for geographic information standard in order to
    develop the reference model for agro-geoinformation standard. According to the
    different levels of regional, association and international, the reference model
    for geographic information standard included “Geographic information - Reference
    model” by Geographic Information Technical Committee of European Committee for
    Standardization (CEN/TC 287) (1996)[1], “OGC Reference Model” by Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) (2003)[2] and ISO 19101–2002 “Geographic information - Reference
    model” by Geographic information/Geomatics of International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO/TC 211) (2002)[3]. Those reference models proposed frameworks for geographic
    information standards. Because of difference on publishing time, the goal for
    standardization as well as technology development and limitations of human cognitive,
    the contents of those reference models were a large of differences. By using conceptual
    modeling method, CEN/TC 287 reference model presented two category standards-geographic
    data and service. Geographic data standards included semantic aspects, spatial
    aspects, quality aspects and metadata. The service standards included query and
    update service, transfer service. Based on analysis of geographic information
    sharing and interoperability from viewpoints of enterprise, information, computation,
    engineering and technology, OGC reference model developed five level standards.
    The enterprise viewpoint described geographic information business perspective,
    purpose scope and policies. The information viewpoint was concerned with the semantics
    of information and information processing. The computational viewpoint was concerned
    with the functional decomposition of the system into a set of services that interact
    at interfaces. The engineering viewpoint related to specific components linked
    by a communications network. The technology viewpoint was concerned with the underlying
    infrastructure in a distributed system. OGC reference model was by far the most
    comprehensive reference model for geographic information standards. The reference
    model of ISO 19101 by ISO/TC 211grouped five major areas of standards-the framework
    and reference model, data models and operators, data administration, geographic
    information services, profiles and functional standards. The frame work and reference
    model covered more general aspects of ISO geographic standard series. Data models
    and operators were concerned with the underlying spatial geometry and how geographic
    features and their spatial characteristics could be modeled. Data administration
    was concerned with description of quality principles and evaluation procedures
    for geographic information including cataloguing, reference by coordinate or geographic
    identifier and metadata. Geographic information services defined the encoding
    of information in transfer formats and the methodology for presentation based
    on cartography. This area also included the satellite positioning. Profiles and
    functional standards considered the technique of profiling. ISO 19101 was developed
    by the joint participation of experts from countries. But it mainly focused on
    standards of the information viewpoint and the computational viewpoint. With reference
    models for geographic information standard publishing successively overseas, China
    started to pay attention to develop relevant reference models. Some of national
    projects on spatial infrastructure and database development had adopted concepts
    from ISO 19101 to organize, manage and develop project standards. For example,
    “Digital Land Project (2003)” by the Ministry of Land and Resources developed
    “Reference Model for Information of Land and Resources”[4]. “Scientific Data Sharing
    Project” (2003) by the Ministry of Science and Technology developed “Standards
    Framework and Reference Model”[5]. In 2007 and 2008, the National Geographic Information
    Standardization Technical Committee (SAC/TC 230) presented official files on “Standard
    System Framework for Geographic Information”[6] and “National Standard System
    for Geographic Information”[7]. Those provided guidelines for promote development
    of geographic information standard in China. SECTION III. Framework and content
    of reference model for agro-geoinformation standards A. Goals and emphasis of
    agro-geoinformation standardization The goal of agro-geoinformation standardization
    is to achieve the best efficiency in agro-geoinformation production, management,
    applications and services across the different application fields and disciplines,
    to achieve data integration, sharing and interoperability, to achieve information
    services cross different platforms and systems. The standards focus on the combination
    of information technology and agro-geoinformation. B. Standard levels classification
    The framework of reference model for agro-geoinformation standards was proposed
    by learning ideas of the reference model for geographic information standardization.
    Through the analysis of characteristics of agro-geoinformation as well as processes
    from data acquisition, analysis, management and service[8]–[12]. The framework
    of standards was divided into three levels-the base standard level, the general
    standard level, the profile and application standard level (Figure 1). Figure
    1. Framework for agro-geoinformation standards Show All The standards in base
    level were used to guide development of agro-geoinformation standards and specifications.
    They included national standards on geographic information, remote sensing and
    information technology, agriculture industry standards and industry standards
    of other areas. The standards in general level were concerned with generic set
    of agro-geoinformation standards on the basis of the base standard level. It included
    five groups on guidance standards, data or product standards, management standards,
    application system development standards and information service standards. The
    general standard level had roles for control and restriction of the profile and
    application standard level and could be implemented in the lower level. When necessary,
    the lower application standard level could be extended for the specific application
    requirements without conflict the principles of the upper general standard level.
    The profile and application standard level was developed on the basis of the base
    standard level and the general standard level, which proposed relevant standards
    and specification for disciplines and projects, such as standards on remote sensing
    for agriculture, standards on digital soil, and so on. C. The general standard
    level 1) Guidance standards The guidance standards for agro-geoinformation standardization
    described requirements, concept, composition and mutual relations, as well as
    the basic principles and methods of use. The guidance standards included standard
    system, reference model, terminology, conformance and testing and profile. Although
    these standards were not specific implement standards, they were the basis for
    the standard development and coordination. a) Reference model or standard system
    for agro-geoinformation standardization Reference model described the goal of
    agro-geoinformation standardization, relevant concepts, the standard framework
    and its relationship. The standard system was the list of standards according
    to their relation intrinsically within a certain range[13]. The standard system
    for agro-geoinformation was formed based on the reference model. Standard names
    were listed in accordance with hierarchy structure of general standards and specific
    standards. The standard system could provide references for the department of
    agro-geoinformation standardization in charge to develop standard policies. b)
    Terminology on agro-geoinformation Terminology definition and reference on agro-geoinformation
    was a bit of confusing at present. The same term had different definition in different
    standards, which affected the expression, storage and exchange of agro-geoinformation.
    There was an urgent need for the term unified to eliminate ambiguity. The terminology
    standard on agro-geoinformation was concerned with criteria and conditions for
    the term selection, definition record structure, semantic representation and its
    source. The role of the standard was to guarantee uniform agro-geoinformation
    expression consistency from the concept. c) Conformance and testing The standard
    on conformance and testing for agro-geoinformation provided framework, concepts
    and methodology for testing data or software product or service or by specifications
    and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance to relevant agro-geoinformation
    standards. It provided a framework for specifying abstract test suites and defining
    the procedures to be followed during conformance testing. This standard could
    be used with the profile standard to judge consistency between agro-geoinformation
    standards and the external standards. d) the profile for agro-geoinformation Base
    standards and general standards have provided foundation and guide for application
    standards. But different communities had different requirements for the extent
    they want to use or implement these standards. It needed clearly identification
    and documentation of specific subsets of the base and general standards in a prescribed
    manner in conformance with these standards profiles. The profile was set of one
    or more base standards or subsets of base standards, and, where applicable, the
    identification of chosen clauses, classes, options and parameters of those base
    standards, that were necessary for accomplishing a particular function[14]. Profiles
    for agro-geoinformation defined conformance relationship between profiles and
    base standards, how profiles referenced base standards. 2) Data or product standards
    These standards specified data or product content, acquisition, processing, storage
    and maintenance for agro-geoinformation. a) Classification and encoding for agro-geoinformation
    Agro-geoinformation is information concerning phenomena implicitly or explicitly
    associated with a location relative to agriculture. It includes agriculture natural
    information such as water, soil, climate resources, crop resources and economy
    information such as population of rural areas, labor force and agricultural production.
    It also includes remote sensing images such as satellite images, aerial photos
    and interpreting graphics. The standards of classification and encoding defined
    contents, classification and encoding of agricultural spatial dataset through
    analysis of data sources, processing, products and applications. b) Data element
    expression for agro-geoinformation The data element is a set of attributes to
    describe the data definition, identification, representation and domain of the
    data unit[15]. Its proposes was to clearly understand data meaning, representation
    and identification between users and owners in order to exchange data easily and
    share in different application environments, such as data elements for agro-meteorological
    information, soil information, et al. Data elements could be divided into general
    data elements and application data elements. General data elements was independent
    any specific application. It provided a general data element dictionary. Such
    as, soil data element was a general data element dictionary[16], the data elements
    for the national second soil survey data was an application data element. c) Data
    dictionary for agro-geoinformation The data dictionary is a collection of non-application
    data in database. They are organized according to a certain pattern and managed
    regularity by using computer to establish database about database. The data dictionary
    could be used for data management, maintenance, sharing, distribution and services.
    The database or data files included vector data, raster data, text data, data
    on audio and video. Based on different description object, the data dictionary
    could be divided into the database dictionary and feature dictionary. d) Feature
    cataloging for agro-geoinformation Geographic feature is abstraction of real world
    phenomena[17]. Agro-geoinformation feature was abstraction of agricultural phenomena
    related to the location on earth. The feature catalogue defined feature type,
    feature attribute, feature operation and its relation to make common understanding
    between user and owner in order to promote agro-geoinformation distribution, sharing
    and usage. e) Metadata for agro-geoinformation Due to data confidentiality or
    paid-sharing factors, some agro-geoinformation was not public free use. But metadata
    about database was free on internet. Metadata is data about data[18]. It used
    to describe the contents, coverage range, spatial referencing, data quality, data
    owner and so on. It provided a way of searching datasets through internet. There
    were several standards about metadata, such as GB/T 19710–2005 “Geographic information
    - Metadata”[19], ISO 19115–2-2010 “Geographic information - Metadata-images and
    grid data”[20]. It was necessary to develop metadata for agro-geoinformation satisfied
    to the requirement of agricultural application information system. Metadata for
    agro-geoinformation described the content and structure of metadata elements of
    datasets and its extension mechanisms. f) Data acquisition standard for agro-geoinformation
    There were several methods of data acquisition, such as methods from network,
    surveying, research, interview, exchange and querying. Different methods could
    get different data types and had different data quality requirements. Data acquisition
    standard mainly described technical indicator requirement for data acquisition
    environment, methods, data processing and precision of results. g) Standard for
    agro-geoinformation updating The standard mainly specified principles, requirements,
    environment, methods, processes and accuracy requirements for agro-geoinformation
    data update. h) Specification of data product Data products for agro-geoinformation
    included spatial data products of vector, raster and images, such as soil maps,
    crop suitability assessment maps and MODIS images. They also included attribute
    data products, such as observation data from meteorological stations, information
    system software and hardware such as grassland management information systems,
    soil moisture meter and so on. The specification of data products mainly defined
    requirements for data products identification, content, structure, reference coordination,
    data quality, data acquisition, data maintenance and graphic expression. It was
    the basis for the work of producer and valuable for user to select, purchase and
    use agro-geoinformation data products. 3) Management standards a) Specification
    for data security Data security included data confidentiality, integrity, identification
    and authorization. The specification mainly presented data security and privacy
    regulations required at the systems of the core layer, the internal layer and
    the external layer in order to get a wider range of application. b) Quality control
    for agro-geoinformation The standards described data quality control requirement
    for quantitative elements and non-quantitative elements of data collection, management,
    sharing, services and evaluation processing. Components of quantity element included
    data completeness, logical consistency, positional accuracy, temporal accuracy
    and thematic accuracy[21]. Components of non-quantity element included data purpose,
    usage and lineage. Data quality evaluation procedure included methodology for
    data quality measures, such as direct and indirect evaluation, and quality information
    report[22]. c) Testing for software or products The testing purpose was to verify
    whether software or products met quality requirements of the system design, product
    specification and related standards in order to find errors or defects. Testing
    standards for agro-geoinformation system or products concerned with testing technical
    requirements related to spatial data processing and product services. It could
    be developed referenced to GB/T 15532-2008 “Specification for Computer Software
    Test”[23] and GB/T 19333.5–2003 “Geographic information - Conformance and testing”[24].
    It specified testing category, procedures, methods, documentation and testing
    tool selection. d) Storage and archiving of agro-geoinformation The forms of agro-geoinformation
    storage and archiving included electronic documents and materials in paper form.
    Electronic documents referred to files and database generated from the digital
    equipment, stored on tape, disk, CD-ROM carrier in digital form. They depended
    on computers and other digital devices to read and process[25]. Specification
    of storage and archiving was concerned with technical requirements about rules
    and methods for data organization, naming, compression, restoration, storage and
    backup. 4) Standards for application system development a) Specifications for
    design of agro-geoinformation application softwares With the development of agricultural
    information technology, a number of agro-geoinformation software appeared, such
    as the real-time field data acquisition system for grassland, agricultural status
    monitoring system by remote sensing. However, due to lack of specifications for
    software design, the software system had the low level of efficiency and poor
    repeat use. So it was necessary to establish specifications of software system
    design for all aspects of information collection and decision-making processing.
    Specifications for agricultural information application software design could
    be developed based on the information technology specification. The main contents
    should include software requirements, design, construction, testing, maintenance,
    configuration management and so on. b) Specifications for agro-geoinformation
    system development From the perspective of system design and development, specifications
    for agro-geoinformation system development specified process of system development,
    defined system functions. The main contents include specification for the project
    organization and management, requirements for system construction process, requirements
    for system platform and system functions. c) Specifications for agro-geoinformation
    development on network It is the trend to develop public agro-geoinformation technology
    platform on network. For example, the wireless sensor network technology could
    meet the need for precision agriculture information systems. Specifications for
    agro-geoinformation development on network mainly concerned with the basic process,
    internetworking (such as network structure and topology, standards for network
    access equipment, network interconnection agreement, protocol), LAN network construction,
    IP address and requirements for acceptance testing. d) Database development for
    agro-geoinformation There have been a large number of agro-geoinformation databases.
    Since there was no unified database structure and data description standards,
    the structure of feature and attribute description were varied, which affected
    data sharing and interoperation. Therefore, it was necessary to develop standards
    on database. Standards referred to description of feature structure for spatial
    data and attribute structure description. e) Specification on equipment requirements
    for agro-geo information The specifications were concerned with technical indicator
    requirements for ago-geoinformation data acquisition, processing, service, storage
    and backup related to computer network equipment, communications as well as equipment
    testing, such as specification for wireless sensor network technology for precision
    agriculture, standard of the general bus for agricultural machinery. 5) Standards
    for information services a) Positioning services for agro-geoinformation Positioning
    services provided information on location, observation accuracy through a variety
    use of techniques. For example, precision agriculture system could implement a
    set of modern farming technology on positioning, timing and quantity based on
    spatial variability. Precision agriculture used global positioning system (GPS)
    for information acquisition and accurate positioning. Intelligent agricultural
    machinery with GPS could control precision seeding, fertilizing, spraying automatically.
    Standards on positioning service specified data structures and operations required
    by positioning services interface as well as location-based services, so that
    spatial-oriented systems (such as GIS) could make more effective use of these
    technologies to achieve a variety of positioning technologies interoperability.
    b) Web Services on agro-geoinformation With the increasing requirement for agro-geoinformation
    sharing, how to make users to find and use those data effectively was an issue
    to face. We could learn from FGDC geographic information exchange center established
    by USA to set up metadata-based information distribution service system to promote
    agro-geoinformation data sharing through network directory service, format conversion
    services, web registration services and map services. Standards on web service
    described those services. c) Data interface and exchange for agro-geo information
    Agro-geoinformation data types included spatial data and attribute data. Exchange
    format for attribute data was relatively simpler than spatial data. As spatial
    data distributed at different departments, spatial data storage structure was
    different. Such as, some spatial data stored in ARCINFO Shape file format, some
    in DXF format. Data sharing and interoperability became issues. China has published
    GB/T 17798–2007 “Geospatial Data Interchange Format”, which specified vector and
    raster data exchange format applicable to interchange of vector data, image, grid
    data and digital elevation model (DEM)[26]. ISO/TC 211 introduced GML (Geography
    Markup Language) to be the basis for set up open geodata interoperability platform[27].
    The spatial data exchange and sharing for agro-geoinformation between nodes under
    the network environment could take GML-based multi-source heterogeneous spatial
    data exchange model to implement heterogeneous spatial data exchange. So it needed
    to develop standards on agro-geoinformation data model, interchange format and
    technology to implement spatial data exchange and sharing through network. d)
    Portrayal on agro-geoinformation Different application system had different digital
    map display standard, such as graphic expression on crop sown area distribution
    map was different with grassland desertification monitoring map. The standard
    of portrayal on agro-geoinformation was concerned with defining a map expression
    schema, map expression director package for feature types, portrayal specification
    with parameters required by express services. The standards should also provide
    classification of element symbols, size, positioning point symbols and positioning
    lines, graphic symbol color, annotation and other contents. e) Specifications
    of data sharing and publishing on agro-geoinformation Some agro-geoinformation
    data could be shared freely to the public. But a considerable portion of data
    related to intellectual property rights and copyright needed to set permissions
    and provided paid services. Specifications of data sharing and publishing on agro-geoinformation
    specified data sharing classification, the provisions of data sharing service
    object type and permissions, channels for data sharing and requirements for data
    publish in order to ensure data wide used. SECTION IV. Implement mechanism for
    profile to agro-geoinformation standardization A. Implementation mechanism The
    base standards and the general standards provided technical requirements, processes
    and models for agro-geoinformation and application system development. Some of
    standards were creating elements; others were introducing structures and rules.
    Different agricultural application fields had different requirements for the extent
    they wanted to use or implemented these elements and rules. Profiles could promote
    integration of base standards by defining how to use a combination of base standards
    for a given functional environment. Some profiles could be developed based on
    the rules defined by the base standards. Some profiles could select relevant contents
    or elements directly from the base standards particular to the special application.
    These profiles developed in accordance with profile mechanism and could ensure
    conformance with the base standards. To ensure for the control and restriction,
    profiles should be developed in accordance with the rules of profiling. Mandatory
    requirements in base standards remained mandatory in the profile. Optional requirements
    in base standards could be mandatory, condition or option to suit the implementation
    in the profile. The profile should include contents on claiming conformance to
    the base and general standards. It also should define requirements satisfied any
    implementation consistent to the profile. Through the conformance abstract test
    suite, the profile could be tested to satisfy all the conformance requirements
    with the base standards so as to ensure the consistency of agro-geoinformation
    profiles with base standards. B. An application example GB/T 19710–2005 “Geographic
    Information-Metadata” described over 400 mandatory, conditional and optional metadata
    elements, as well as core metadata elements for geographic information dataset[19].
    To the field of agro-geoinformation, such as grassland resource information, metadata
    elements could be formed selecting metadata elements from GB/T 19710, combined
    with its own data characteristics, constituted a metadata elements suitable for
    grassland resource information, such as NY/T 1171–2006 “Metadata for grassland
    resource information[28]. NY/T 1171 reduced a lot of unsuitable metadata elements
    unsuitable to describe grassland resources information (Figure 2). Figure 2. Example
    of profile for grassland resources information metadata Show All SECTION V. Conclusion
    The reference model for agro-geoinformation provided a new idea for the construction
    of the standard system. It defined three standard levels and five groups of the
    general standards. It also put forward important principles and methods for building
    specific agricultural information standard profiles and application standards
    based on base standard and general standard. The purpose was to enhance the coordination
    between standards to achieve the best overall effectiveness and promote the integration
    and sharing of agro-geoinformation. The reference model had guidance meaning for
    agro-geoinformation standardization which focused on information accumulation,
    application and service. Acknowledgement Supported by National Basic Research

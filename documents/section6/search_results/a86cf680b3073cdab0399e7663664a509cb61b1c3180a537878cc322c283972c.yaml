    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    \ several years may be needed to determine \ntrends in the parameters of interest,\
    \ and hence, data becomes a regular input to the farm management \nsystem. Therefore,\
    \ the necessity of monitoring crops comes from the existence of variability, but\
    \ there \nis a need for the producer to manage that variability in a feasible\

    \ of management \nzones would reduce the cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, \nprovide better farm records that are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for \nmanagement decisions [4]. According\
    \ to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a \nfunction of the\
    \ natural variability within the field, the size of the field and certain management\
    \ \nfactors. If the variability is high, the minimum size of a zone is limited\
    \ by the possibility of each \nfarmer to differentially manage regions within\
    \ a field in economic and logistics terms. In addition to \ndecide the area of\

    \ is assumed for all \nfields by nature. According to Searcy [37], natural variability\
    \ is influenced by weather within a \ngrowing season and from year to year; then,\
    \ data from several years may be needed to determine \ntrends in the parameters\

    \ of variability, but there \nis a need for the producer to manage that variability\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\
    \ This robot is autonomously driven when monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local \nperception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and ultrasound sensors)\
    \ for navigation and safeguarding. It \ngathers data from the canopy of the vines\
    \ with the goal of creating plant water status maps and \nnutritional status maps.\
    \ In order to accomplish its mission in a reasonable timeframe, established by\
    \ \nend-users at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors vine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies \nseveral challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust sensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and \nin motion, while having a cost-efficient\
    \ price for the agriculture sector. Regarding software, the \nchallenge was the\
    \ agile integration of all the crop-sensing devices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ \nvalidation of the models developed in the field. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure\

    \ \nFigure 2. Version II (2019) of VineScout autonomous robot: Front (a) and rear\
    \ (b).\n3.3. Stage III: Data\nOne of the fundamental diﬀerences between traditional\
    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\
    \ It includes the\nname of each application program, the company commercializing\
    \ it with its headquarters location,\nand the main features of the program. The\
    \ table is focused on programs managing crop data as the\nprimary tool, and its\
    \ purpose is not the compilation of all available FMIS software, which would\n\
    be futile given the rate new applications are constantly released, but bringing\
    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\
    \ in actual farms, accelerating the move\nfrom academics to agribusiness. The\
    \ examples show that some smartphone and tablet applications\nalready include\
    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\
    \ companies,\non the contrary, prefer having a basic application for mobile devices\
    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\
    \ the grower in the mobile\ndevice with the data safely stored in the cloud. Many\
    \ of the programs listed below oﬀer the option\nof upgrading the software depending\
    \ on speciﬁc grower needs, increasing the price accordingly.\nThe most advanced\
    \ tools include features for ﬁnancial and machinery management, help in the\n\
    decision-making process, release warnings, or even propose management advice.\
    \ In many cases, these\nsoftware applications are not only addressed to the grower\
    \ or producer, but also to other stakeholders in\nagriculture such as inputs suppliers,\
    \ service suppliers, and food distributors, which makes a diﬀerence\nfor Smart\
    \ Farming, where multiple agriculture agents are connected. Regarding exploitation\
    \ rights,\nvarious agricultural management systems have been patented, as the\

    \ T: Technology); 2 PaaS: Platform as a service.\nThe use of commercial data management\
    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ some action on the crop or\nrelated to it, and this can be done by making decisions\
    \ right after obtaining information (real-time\napplications) or in another moment\
    \ deferred in time (oﬀ-line). For farmers to execute decisions,\nthey need advanced\
    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    [66] 4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of
    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    Abstract: Future buildings will offer new convenience, comfort, and efficiency
    possibilities to their residents. Changes will occur to the way people live as
    technology involves people''s lives and information processing is fully integrated
    into their daily living activities and objects. The future expectation of smart
    buildings includes making the residents'' experience as easy and comfortable as
    possible. The massive streaming data generated and captured by smart building
    appliances and devices contain valuable information that needs to be mined to
    facilitate timely actions and better decision making. Machine learning and big
    data analytics will undoubtedly play a critical role to enable the delivery of
    such smart services. In this paper, we survey the area of smart building with
    a special focus on the role of techniques from machine learning and big data analytics.
    This survey also reviews the current trends and challenges faced in the development
    of smart building services. The major machine learning tasks that are relevant
    to smart buildings include: data collection and acquisition, data pre-processing,
    and dimensionality reduction. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume: 7) Page(s):

    I. Introduction Although the term “smart building” (SB) may bring a thought of
    a fictional smart space from science-fiction movies, but the reality is that SBs
    exist today, and their number is getting increased. With recent advances in machine
    learning (ML), big data analytics, sensor technologies and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), regular buildings can be cost-effectively transformed into SBs with bare
    minimum infrastructural modifications. There are smart office, smart library,
    smart home, smart health care facilities, smart hospital and many other types
    of SBs that can provide automated services that can provide many value-added services
    (such as reduction of wasted energy) and also help to ensure the comfort, health,
    and safety of the occupants. The hyperconnectivity that will be brought about
    by the emergence of IoT will increase the promise of SB since now all the basic
    building amenities and commodities ranging from your house electronics to your
    plant vases will be interconnected. But this hyperconnectivity will at the same
    time complicate the process of managing SBs. In particular, SBs and their inhabitants
    are expected to create large volumes of streaming data. ML, sampling, compression,
    learning, and filtering technologies are becoming more significant to manage the
    stream of big data of individuals. In 1981, the term Intelligent Buildings (IBs)
    was initially coined by United Technology Building Systems (UTBS) Corporation
    in the U.S. In July 1983, IBs became a reality with the opening of the City Place
    Building in Hartford, Connecticut [1]. Today, the number of SBs is growing at
    an unprecedented rate including smart office, smart hospitality, smart educational
    facilities etc. [2]. An SB is recognized as an integrated system that takes advantage
    of a range of computational and communications infrastructure and techniques [3].
    Examples of SB services include smart thermostats that allow the temperature to
    be controlled based on the time of the day/year and the users’ preferences with
    minimal or no manual configuration. Using data analytics to “learn” the users’
    preferences before taking the appropriate actions is probably the most important
    enabling technology for IBs [4]. Lately, smart coffee machines appeared in the
    market with the capability to make coffee automatically, according to users’ preferences
    and schedules. Fridges can offer allocated programming interfaces for their control
    [5]. IBs aim to provide their users with safe, energy efficient, environment-friendly,
    and convenient services. In order to maximize comfort, minimize cost, and adapt
    to the needs of their inhabitants, SBs must rely on sophisticated tools to learn,
    predict, and make intelligent decisions. SB algorithms cover a range of technologies,
    including prediction, decision-making, robotics, smart materials, wireless sensor
    networks, multimedia, mobile computing, and cloud computing. With these technologies,
    buildings can cognitively manage many SB services such as security, privacy, energy
    efficiency, lighting, maintenance, elderly care, and multimedia entertainment.
    The massive volume of sensory data collected from sensors and appliances must
    be analyzed by algorithms, transformed into information, and minted to extract
    knowledge so that machines can have a better understanding of humans than their
    environment. Furthermore, and most importantly, such knowledge can lead to new
    products and services that can dramatically transform our lives. For example,
    readings from smart meters can be used to better predict and balancing the usage
    of power. Monitoring and processing sensory data from wearable sensors attached
    to patients can produce new remote healthcare services. The main philosophy behind
    ML is to create the analytical models automatically in order to permit the algorithms
    to learn continuously from available data. The application of ML techniques increased
    over the last two decades due to the availability of massive amounts of complex
    data and the increased usability of current ML tools. Today, ML is already widely
    applied in different applications including recommendation systems offered by
    online services (e.g., Amazon, Netflix) and automatic credit rating services used
    by banks. Alphabet’s Nest thermostat utilizes ML to “learn” the temperature preferences
    of its users and adapt to their work schedule to minimize the energy use. Other
    widely publicized examples of ML applications include Google’s self-driving car,
    sentiment analysis of Amazon and Twitter data, fraud detection, and Facebook’s
    facial-recognition technology that is used to tag the suggested person on images
    uploaded by users. A. SB Trends and Market Impact In this section, we look at
    the statistics related to SBs, to allow us to understand the current trends and
    motivations in industry marketplaces and academic researches toward SBs. According
    to the report by MarketsandMarkets [6], The SB market is estimated to grow from
    7.42 billion dollars in 2017 to 31.74 billion dollars by 2022, at a Compound Annual
    Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.7% from 2017 to 2022. In yet another report Zion Market
    Research [7], 2016 and it is expected to reach 61,900 million dollars by 2024.
    It is expected to exhibit a CAGR of more than 34% between 2017 and 2024. The market
    is primarily driven by government initiatives globally for SB projects and the
    increasing market for integrated security and safety systems as well as energy
    efficient building systems. Figure 1 shows the Statista [8] forecast market size
    of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars). FIGURE
    1. Forecast market size of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 [8].
    Show All According to the Gartner report [9], it is expected that the number of
    smart connected homes grows to 700 million homes by 2020, supplied by mass consumer
    adoption and an increase in the number of devices and apps available. Figure 2
    shows Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle expectation for deep learning, ML, connected homes,
    and smart workspace. FIGURE 2. Hype Cycle for the Connected Home, 2018 [7]. Show
    All According to report by Research and Markets [10], [11], the global IoT SB
    market will reach approximately $51.44B USD globally by 2023. The report also
    forecast that 33% of IoT SB market will be supplied by artificial intelligent
    technologies by 2023, and automation systems of SB will grow at 48.3% CAGR from
    2018–2023. Frost & Sullivan also predict that by 2025, the growth of connected
    home living will reach 3.7 billion smartphones, 700 million tablets, 520 million
    wearable health-related devices and 410 million smart appliances in the connected
    person world. B. Related Survey Papers Although many of survey papers focused
    on SBs have been published, none of them is focused on the role of data analytics

    perspective of SB projects. Finally, Section VII presents a summary of lessons
    learned and concludes the paper. For the convenience of the readers, we have enlisted
    the important acronyms used in Table 1. SECTION II. Smart Buildings: Concept and
    Architecture In 1984, The New York Times published an article that described that
    real estate developers are creating “a new generation of buildings that almost
    think for themselves called intelligent buildings.” Such an intelligent building
    (IB) was defined as “a marriage of two technologies - old-fashioned building management
    and telecommunications.” [23]. Since then, many definitions of SBs have been suggested.
    This is due to the fact that the life-cycle of building planning, design, implementation,
    and operation involves different industry players that have different roles. In
    addition, the rapid changes in technology are affecting this definition. For instance,
    the advent of IoT and smart city concepts is impacting the definition of SB. Therefore,
    it is hard to compose a unique view of IBs with a single definition that is accepted
    worldwide. However, it is vital to have a good understanding of the main standard
    bodies and companies involved in shaping the development of SBs [1]. The Institute
    for Building Efficiency [24] focuses on the operation of buildings to provide
    efficient healthy and comfortable environment [25]. IBM [26] focuses also on the
    operation of SBs to provide integrated physical and digital infrastructures that
    provide reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective occupancy services. According
    to the European Commission’s Information Society [27], SBs means buildings that
    are supplied by information and communication technologies in the context of the
    combining Ubiquitous Computing and the IoT: In general, the buildings that are
    supplied with sensors, actuators, microchips, micro- and nano-embedded systems
    in order to enable collecting, filtering and producing more information locally,
    to be further incorporated and managed globally according to business functions.”
    In SBs, a variety of AI and multi-agent system techniques are employed including
    [28]: Reasoning and knowledge representation including ontologies and rules to
    represent devices and building services. ML for human activity recognition. Multi-agent
    systems for distributed intelligence and semantic interoperability. Intelligent
    approaches such as planning, intelligent control, adaptive interfaces, and optimization
    for efficient management of resources and services. An SB is therefore the integration
    of a wide range of systems and services into a unified environment that involve
    energy management systems, temperature monitoring systems, access security systems,
    fire and life safety, lighting control and reduction, telecommunications services,
    office automation, computer systems, area locating systems, LANs, management information
    systems, cabling and records, maintenance systems, and expert systems [29]. Figure
    3 shows examples of SB appliances including air-conditioning systems, lighting
    systems, solar energy generators, power-supply systems, temperature sensors, humidity
    sensors, power usage sensors, and surveillance cameras. For example, centralized
    control of these elements can promote the efficient use of energy through the
    intelligent control of lights and air conditioning units and the intelligent management
    of multiple green and brown energy sources. In most cases, an SB uses an Ethernet
    backbone with bridges to a Controller Area Network (CAN) [26]. FIGURE 3. Example
    of SB appliances. Show All It is easier to introduce smart services in residential
    buildings compared to commercial buildings since residential buildings have less
    technical equipment and less stringent efficiency requirements. Because the commercial
    buildings usually have more public visitors and therefore building models for
    commercial buildings are usually more challenging than building models for residential
    buildings which usually have a limited number of the occupants most of the time.
    In addition, the costs associated with the purchase and installation of smart
    devices and infrastructure at commercial buildings is more than residential buildings.
    Figure 4 shows an integrated framework in a residential building that employs
    a network of intelligent sensors. These sensors control systems such as energy
    generation, metering, HVAC, lighting, and security. A building automation system
    manages a set of smart appliances, sensors, and actuators, which collectively
    deliver services for the well-being of the inhabitants. Examples of such smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators include washers and dryers, refrigerators,
    heaters, thermostats, lighting systems, power outlets, energy meters, smoke detectors,
    televisions, game consoles, windows/door controllers and sensors, air conditioners,
    video cameras, and sound detectors. More advanced smart devices are constantly
    being developed like smart floors and smart furniture [28], [30]. FIGURE 4. Smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators in a smart residential building. Show All The
    IoT will enable the integration and interoperability of heterogeneous devices
    in SBs as well as the real-time processing of the data generated by sensors in
    support of optimal control and operation of the building. In this paper, We propose
    a layered architecture for SBs based on the layered architecture of IoT. Figure
    5 shows the layered architecture of SBs. FIGURE 5. Layers of the base IoT architecture
    that serves as the foundation for SBs. Show All As can be seen from the sensing
    layer (the bottom layer in Figure 5), input data is obtained from different types
    of physical sensors that monitor environmental parameters, collect data about
    residents and detect anomalies (e.g., fire and water pipe bursts). This layer
    also includes actuators that can be controlled to save energy, minimize water
    consumption, etc. The network layer (the second layer in Figure 5), includes access
    and core networks that provide transparent data transmission capability. This
    layer serves as a bridge between the sensing layer and the upper layers which
    are mainly responsible for data processing. An intermediary software layer called
    the middleware layer is needed (the third layer in Figure 5) to provide seamless
    integration of heterogeneous devices and networks covered by the sensing layer
    of the architecture. That layer serves as a bridge between the embedded software
    that runs of smart sensors and back-end software services. This layer provides
    interoperability using standardized programming interfaces and protocols [31].
    Therefore, this layer performs the process of converting the collected data from
    various data formats into a common representation. SB middleware can be based
    on open standards or proprietary, in addition, application-specific or general-purpose.
    Most often, proprietary middleware is application-specific while general-purpose
    middleware is based on open standards [28]. The context and semantic discovery
    layer (the fourth layer in Figure 5) is responsible for managing context and semantic
    discoverers including context and semantics generating, configuring, and storing.
    The processing and reasoning layer (the fifth layer in Figure 5) is responsible
    for processing the extracted information from the middleware then according to
    the application’s type it will make decisions. In this layer, there are various
    techniques of information processing applied to fuse, extract, contextualize.
    massive data into useful actionable knowledge. In this layer, two phases should
    be identified: context consumer and context producer of the middleware. In the
    context consumer phase, the data processing techniques are applied on the data
    produced by the middleware; while in context producer phase the process of decision-making
    is implemented to supply the service layer with valuable knowledge. while in the
    second stage, further context information can be provided to the middleware for
    registration in the ontology context. Specific services and applications are abstracted
    in the application layer (the top-most layer in Figure 5). This layer presents
    a framework with direct access to the underlying functionalities to serve in the
    implementation of various types of applications. Moreover, control panels should
    be installed in the building to control the automated indoor spaces and to support
    a local human-machine interface. For instance, in a multi-story building, each
    floor could have a control panel to automate the operations, such as control opening
    the windows, control of air conditioning to achieve the desired temperature, control
    close/open the blinds according to the preferred light intensity before using
    artificial lighting [32], [33]. Summary: Still there is no single standard definition
    for SBs. In this section, we reviewed many definitions for SBs by many institutes,
    counties, regions and different disciplines; each has their own definition for
    SBs. We presented the layered architectural pattern for adapting services in an
    SB environment. We wanted to provide a general design for adapting actions according
    to the different versions of context in SBs. This architecture may be used in
    different smart environments such as intelligent transport systems, security,
    health assistance, and SBs among others. We layered the architecture into six
    layers starting from the sensing layer, which includes various types of sensors
    that are installed to collect environmental information in SBs. While network
    layer providing data stream support and data flow control and ensuring that messages
    arrive reliably by using data transport protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet
    etc. Data Acquisition layer to collect the data from the heterogeneous sources
    of data. Context and semantic discovery layer to generate, configure, and store
    context and semantic information. Context processing and reasoning layer to process
    the information and extract the knowledge that making the decisions according
    to the application context. And the last layer which is application layer such
    as health assistance and elderly home care, comfort and entertainment services,
    security, tele-management, smart watering, energy efficiency, etc. After discussing
    the main components of commercial and residential buildings, we have now set the
    stage for a detailed discussion on the components of SBs in the next section.
    SECTION III. Smart Building Components Advances in smart building technology have
    driven to the extensive development of SBs to generate economic and environmental
    benefits for building owners through the convergence of IT and building automation
    systems. Figure 6 shows the key components of SB systems, these include extensive
    sensors and actuators systems, networking and communication systems, software
    platform system, HVAC system, and smart control devices. FIGURE 6. Components
    of smart buildings. Show All Current systems utilize control devices and smart
    sensors that are connected to a central system. These control devices and smart
    sensors are placed throughout the environment. Each particular system has its
    own collection of networking and communication systems that enable it to communicate
    with the central system. SBs are performing connected networks that serve as a
    communication backbone for multiple systems. In many ways, HVAC equipment is the
    most complicated building system, with numerous components arranged to produce
    heating, cooling, and ventilation. The functionality of HVAC system not only makes
    the building healthy and comfortable for its inhabitants, but it also manages
    a big part of the energy consumed, as well as plays a significant role in life
    safety. SBs adopt technology to monitor and control facility systems and perform
    any required modifications. The objective of an SB is to utilize computers and
    software to control lighting, alarm systems, HVAC, and other systems through a
    single computer interface. A. Sensors and Actuators for SBs Sensors and actuators
    are mechanical components that measure and control the environmental values of
    their environment. Sensors collect information from the environment and make it
    ready for the system. For instance, IR sensors can be utilized for human presence
    detection in a room. While actuator is a device to convert an electrical control
    signal to a physical action, such that it takes decisions and then performs proper
    actions according to the environment, which enables automated and remote interaction
    with the environment.For example, a light actuator is capable of switching on/off,
    dimming one or more electric lights [34]. The rapid development of micromechanics,
    microelectronics, integrated optics, and other related technologies has facilitated
    the development of different types of smart sensors integrated into daily objects
    and infrastructure at smart building environment or worn by the users, and are
    connected by network technologies in order to collect contextual information about
    daily living activities more efficiently and faster, with lower energy consumption
    and less processing resources. Environmental sensors are utilized for detecting
    the human activity of a specific object that performed in specific locations in
    the building, while wearable sensors are utilized for controlling and observing
    mobile activities and physiological signals [35]. 1) Environmental Sensors It
    is found that data collected from environmental sensors can form important information
    to monitor human behaviors within an SB. These sensory data are then analyzed
    to identify and observe basic and instrumental daily living activities made by
    occupants such as bathing, dressing, preparing a meal, taking medication etc.
    The environmental sensing is generally based on several simple binary sensors
    in every part of the home, RFID technology, and video cameras. This variety of
    sensing may implement important insight into contexts and actual activities although
    it might come with possible costs such as complexity. Motion sensors are utilized
    for detecting the occupant’s presence and location everywhere in the house. There
    are different types of motion sensors. IR presence sensor is one of the most utilized
    kind of motion sensors in SBs to detect occupants’ presence. Pressure sensors
    can be attached to the objects such as beds, chairs, sofas, and floors in order
    to track the actions and locations of the occupants. While Contact switches are
    usually placed on the doors of fridge, rooms, or cabinets to detect the actions
    that the occupant makes with these objects [36]. Light sensors, humidity sensors,
    temperature sensors, or power sensors are other types of sensors that are deployed
    and utilized in SB to recognize the activities. Light sensors are utilized to
    measure the light intensity in a particular room in the building. Humidity sensors
    are utilized to detect the air humidity of a specific location in the building.
    Temperature sensors are utilized to measure the temperature of the specific environment.
    while the power sensors are utilized to identify the power usage of electric devices.
    2) Wearable Sensors and Biosensors These sensors are attached directly or indirectly
    to the user body. Their small size enables these sensors to be attached to clothes,
    wristwatches, glasses, belts, shoes etc. These sensors can be categorized into
    inertial sensors and vital sign sensors (or biosensors). Wearable inertial sensors
    are highly transportable and no stationary units that can give accurately detailed
    features of occupant’s action and body posture. Those sensors are composed of
    accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. There is a need for receivers
    and cameras in the process of data collection, therefore can be used outside laboratory
    circumstances [37]. Wearable biosensors such as blood pressure, skin temperature,
    and heart rate are significant for collecting vital signs to monitor the health.
    The most commonly utilized inertial sensors for mobile activity monitoring are
    accelerometers and gyroscopes. Accelerometers can be utilized to measure the rate
    of acceleration accompanying a sensitive axis, they are useful to monitor the
    motion’s activities such as doing exercise, standing, sitting, walking, or walking
    upstairs and downstairs. While the gyroscopes can be utilized to measure angular
    velocity and maintain orientation. Some examples of primary vital signs are Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and respiratory
    rate. There are various vital sign sensor utilized to measure different vital
    signals such as Electroencephalography sensors (EEG) for observing electrical
    brain activity, Electrooculography sensors (EOG) for observing eye movement in
    ocular activity, Electromyography sensors (EMG) for observing muscle activity.
    Electrocardiography sensors (ECG) for observing cardiac activity, pressure sensors
    for observing blood pressure, CO2 gas sensors for observing respiration, thermal
    sensors for observing body temperature and galvanic skin response for observing
    skin sweating [38], [39]. 3) Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
    HVAC system plays an essential role in SB services. HVAC system plays a remarkable
    role in efficient energy consumption in SBs, as well as it offers new operating
    options to increase the occupants’ comfort. In addition to meeting the desired
    temperature, HVAC control systems are produced in order to sustain comfort within
    an enclosed space by producing a specific level of humidity, pressure, air motion,
    and air quality in an SB [40]. CO2, humidity and temperature levels in a building
    can affect occupant’s health and comfort; consequently measuring CO2, humidity,
    and temperature in this context can improve personal wellbeing [41]. Heating and
    cooling systems consume a huge amount of energy in the buildings, so it is necessary
    to optimize it utilizing smart controllers and sensors in order to save operational
    costs. Smart HVAC systems can sense and control efficiently different air quality
    parameters inside the building by utilizing distributed sensors and VAV fans throughout
    the building to perform an optimal ventilation [42]. Most of the current HVAC
    actuation systems in smart buildings are based on the data collected about the
    occupants using sensors and cameras, which are utilized specifically for HVAC
    systems. Certainly, There is a specific cost for the design, maintenance, setup
    and hardware of the data collection network [43]. Table 3 shows a summary for
    different types of smart sensors in the SBs. TABLE 3 Various Smart Sensors Useful
    in the Context of SBs B. Smart Control Devices Smart control devices collect data
    from a variety of sensors, process this data, and activate actuators to react
    to the events detected by the sensors. A smart control device can operate independently,
    without control by a central server. But there might be a needed communication
    amongst various control devices or they can connect with each other using the
    smart gateway. WeMo [44] is a Wi-Fi enabled switch utilized to turn electronic
    devices on/off from anywhere. It can control LED motion sensors, light bulbs,
    mart wall switches and plugs, and lighting devices, all from the smartphone app
    or browser. There is no hub needed for WeMo devices, everything can be managed
    through the free cloud service provided by Belkin. You can use the specific channel
    to connect the device to e-services such as Gmail to trigger specific actions.
    WeMo devices also support context-aware feature, it turns on/off automatically
    according to the time of day, whether it is sunrise or sunset etc. The Nest thermostat
    [45], a smart device developed by Nest—which has been acquired by Google—adjusts
    to your life and seasons change automatically. Just use it for a week and it programs
    itself. It learns about the level of temperatures that the occupants prefer and
    creates a context-aware personalized schedule. The smart thermostat turns to an
    energy-efficient mode automatically when the residents leave the building. It
    could start warming up the area when it senses activity, such as an occupant’s
    returning back home from work. The Nest Thermostat is controllable via a smartphone
    and an installed app. If you are away for a while, this device has also a capability
    to sustain a particular temperature in your house. Lockitron [46] is a door lock
    that can control the door remotely over the Internet to open and close it by phone.
    Lockitron app can be installed and used by any iOS or Android smartphone. Homeowners
    can directly grant family and friends the access to open a given door by providing
    authorization over the Internet. Lockitron can also utilize Bluetooth low energy
    technology, which means that it will keep controlling even in the event of Internet
    or power outages. Lockitron can also connect to the Internet with Bridge, through
    which occupants can control the bolt anywhere in the world. The SmartThings [47]
    SB automation system comprised of a communications smart hub, that supports various
    smart appliances and devices; the smart hub supports various technologies and
    protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, as well as IP-accessible devices and lets you
    control appliances using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. SmartThings provides
    kits that include smart plugs, in addition, the basic sensors that can be utilized
    to measure temperature, as well as to detect presence, motion, orientation, and
    vibration. SmartThings also includes an open platform that enables smart device
    vendors and third-party software to provide hardware and software that can be
    utilized alongside the platform. Philips Hue [48] is a combination of LED lighting
    with mobile technology. An accompanying mobile app that allows you to control
    lighting systems and changing color sets depending on your mood utilizing Wi-Fi
    technology. The new Philips Hue bridge supports the required authentication to
    enable Apple HomeKit technology to control and enable your Philips Hue to connect
    to other HomeKit enabled accessories and take control of your home. Blufitbottle
    [49] this bottle records the drinking habits of the users and sends them notifications
    about the time and amount of the water that they are supposed to drink to keep
    them healthy and hydrated. The app collects data about users such as their weight
    and age, plus other factors such as the current levels of temperature and humidity
    to estimate the amount of the needed water to keep them hydrated. When the user
    falls behind with hydration, an alert sounds, as well as a simple glance from
    the LEDs, will indicate when it’s time for the next drink. Canary [50] is an all-in-one
    home security system that comprises a set of sensors such as temperature, air
    quality, sound, motion vibration, in addition, an HD video camera in one unit.
    The system utilizes ML algorithms to let the users know what is happening at home
    and take action by sending notifications to your phone if something happens. Those
    ML models learn over time and send the users smarter notifications as it detects
    motion. So that, the longer you have the system, the more effective it becomes.
    Canary is able to decrease the rate of false alarms by learning the user behavior
    and the ambient noise level and the home temperature patterns. Amazon Echo [51]
    is a small cylinder enable the users to control anything in the home via the voice.
    Amazon Echo has a powerful voice recognition capability, the user does not have
    to worry about the complexities of their voice. Amazon Echo is connectable via
    Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, the users can send voice commands to control the speakers
    as well as other compatible devices such as Belkin’s WeMo and Philips Hue. It
    can also use Amazon cloud Lambda service to send commands. To send any command
    It requires to include the name of the program, for instance, “Alexa, turn on
    TV”. It also includes a network to distant servers, which slows down the response
    time. Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services [52] this device merges personal
    smart home automation with security monitoring task. It enables the occupants
    to control and monitor everything in the home from lighting and window shades
    systems to security cameras and smoke alarms. the user can utilize a smartphone
    app or desktop-mounted hardware console for controlling and monitoring. It can
    provide real-time alerts, GPS vehicle and asset tracking, video viewing, and mobile
    control. The system only supports Z-Wave devices, it needs to be installed by
    an authorized Honeywell dealer. It does not work with Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostats.
    In addition, the Honeywell provides security cameras and sensors, it also supports
    other smart devices from third parties, such as Yale locks and Lutron lighting.
    Table 4 shows a comparison among various smart control devices in the SBs. TABLE
    4 Comparison Among Various Smart Control Devices in SB C. Networking and Home
    Gateway An SB combines a communication network in order to control smart devices
    and services within the building. The communication network of a smart building
    can be based on diverse communication media such as twisted pair cable, as the
    traditional computer networks. The networking in building automation system has
    a tendency to utilize a heterogeneous network that is made up of diverse communication
    media and network standards. The building automation network is identified by
    physical technology and communication protocols. There is an internal network
    that connects devices inside the building, as well as the external networks, can
    be integrated separately. Public Internet, ISDN, and mobile phone networks are
    some examples of external networks [28], [53]. A typical SB may comprise a number
    of different components, such as sensors, actuators, communication and processing
    devices. Because of their nature, these components have limited capabilities and
    computational capacity in term of battery capacity and capability of data processing.
    To deal with this issue, most of the SB systems have been utilized as a central
    gateway to collect, process, and analyze context data from different sensors and
    actuators in the building. Several protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    and Z-wave can be utilized for communicating the gateway. The home gateway can
    also collect and store data for a specific time period. Typically, these gateways
    can connect to the cloud services and perform data processing and reasoning tasks.
    The centralized gateway usually does not have any interface. They can be controlled
    and managed utilizing smartphones, tablets, or computers [54], [55]. In general,
    depending on the communication media used, SB network technology can be classified
    by interconnection method into three main types: Powerline, Busline, and Wireless
    [15], [56], which we describe next. 1) Powerline Communication (PLC) PLC method
    reuses the building electrical network; such that devices, appliances, and services
    are directly connected to the main power supply utilizing the already available
    electrical outlets in a building. The data is sent through the normal cable system
    to activate or deactivate the devices in the building. PLC system is historically
    the oldest technology in SB and is generally cheap but less reliable and scalable
    [3]. Originally, the application of PLC was mainly to secure the typical operation
    of the electric power supply system in case of failures or breakdowns through
    the direct exchange of information between the distribution center, and power
    plant. Therefore, this approach has become a competitive choice for SB networking,
    benefiting from availability, robustness, and ready connectivity of this method.
    Some of the protocols of this method offer a single-way communication, which enables
    the device to only receive information but not to communicate. There are different
    mainstream protocols of PLC method such as X-10, INSTEON, HomePlug, BACnet, and
    Lonworks. 2) Busline Busline systems in SBs networks use a separate physical media,
    usually twisted-pair cabling similar to the physical cables utilized for network
    services for transporting electrical signals. This type of systems is pleasant
    the building’s occupants, albeit the configuration process is complex, and it
    requires some knowledge of networking. Although the configuring complexity and
    installation cost of this system, the use of a separate cable could present a
    positive note about this approach, as it allows this method of networking to provide
    higher bandwidth, and to make it the most reliable of the three approaches. In
    addition, this technology usually supports a completed two-way communication protocol
    that enables the appliances to easily communicate with each other [57]. Some of
    the protocols in Busline technology are Konnex (KNX), CAN (Controller Area Network),
    Modbus, Meter-Bus (M-Bus). 3) Wireless Interconnection Many of the new SB applications
    use wireless technologies such as infrared and radio frequency, which are more
    convenient for users due to their untethered nature and the elimination of cables.
    The devices within the smart building can communicate wirelessly as radio wave
    can penetrate through floors, cabinets, and walls [56]. Because of the complexity
    and cost of potential modifications and of the re-wiring process in a smart building,
    several different wireless technologies are rising to produce flexible networking
    patterns convenient to occupants without taking to consider the physical wiring
    and deployment of such wire in the building. Typically, there are various protocols
    for the wireless system such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WLAN, Z-wave, RFID etc., which
    essentially work in the industrial scientific medical bands, particularly in the
    2.4GHz frequency range. These wireless technologies are usually related to some
    control network concept in an SB such as low power consumption, high cost-effectiveness,
    low speed, flexibility in networking, deployment as well as building coverage
    [3]. The gateway is the central server of an SB that is commonly used in IoT solutions.
    The services provided by the gateway essentially concern to system management
    functionalities such as monitoring, controlling, and configuring the systems and
    their devices. It also supports some processing and data storage capabilities
    required for complex applications. D. Software Platform For a building to be “smart,”
    it is important that all the appliances and systems in the building communicate
    and exchange data securely with each other as well as with smartphones, tablets,
    and servers in the cloud. Software platforms play a critical role in exchanging,
    archiving and disseminating information through different protocols. These platforms
    use push, pull, publish/subscribe, etc. The goal of the joint commercial enterprises
    is to develop an open source software platform in order to make the process of
    data exchanging easier between the devices of different manufacturers. Therefore,
    the users will not have to worry in the future about the compatibility issues
    when utilizing electric and electronic devices of different manufacturers at home.
    In addition, the new platform can also offer a variety of different building services
    such as entertainment, energy efficiency, and security technology. Hence, this
    will enable creating different apps for these areas of use [58]. ABB, Robert Bosch
    GmbH, and Cisco Systems Inc. established an open-software platform called Mozaiq
    Operations GmbH [59] to unify smart building technology and offer interoperability
    across for all devices and services in the building, to simplify the experience
    for residents. It will enable users to seamlessly and intuitively customize their
    appliances and devices, regardless of manufacturers and brands of these devices,
    in order to improve energy efficiency and achieve a unique level of control and
    comfort. For instance, the user can close the blinds in the home either by a click
    from a smartphone or through a pre-set instruction; and switch off automatically
    all screen devices for the children to go outside to play. In a smart building,
    many devices and appliances can simply and securely share information with one
    another and with smartphones and other smart devices; and the Internet in general.
    Indigo Domotics [60] is to implement the do-it-yourself smart building platform.
    Indigo home automation software controllers available for the Mac OS enables residents
    to combine an array of common INSTEON, Z-Wave and X10 devices for unparalleled
    control of your building lighting, sensors, thermostats, and appliances. With
    Indigo Touch (sold through iTunes app store, iOS only), users will easily achieve
    remote control of their appliances utilizing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. They
    also can use a web browser on any device to control their appliances virtually
    anywhere in the world. The users can receive texts or emails about specific events
    has been detected for doors opening/closing, power failures etc. Indigo, from
    Perceptive Automation, is the newest home automation software for the Mac. OpenHAB
    [61] is an open-source software platform that follows a middleware approach for
    integrating different technologies in smart building systems into a single solution.
    OpenHAB platform address a variety of network technologies and appliances in the
    area of a smart building. Currently, the dependency on a particular vendor becomes
    a problem due to the lack of a common language that bridges the different devices
    with building automation system. The main goal of the OpenHAB platform is to integrate
    the new devices and technologies in a smart building system through a community-based
    approach. OpenHAB utilizes an OSGi based modular system for communicating between
    different technologies and devices. Bindings can be developed and deployed as
    an OSGi bundle to bridge a particular technology and device. There are different
    supported technologies exist such as EnOcean, KNX, Z-Wave, and others are supported
    through special bindings [62]. SmartThings [47] this platform composed of hardware
    devices, sensors, and software applications. Context information is collected
    from the sensors, this context is contributed to the reasoning and action that
    are performed by the application. For instance, the sprinkler in the garden can
    detect the rain, and switch itself off accordingly to save water. SmartThings
    kit comprises sensors, smart devices, and hub. While the SmartThings application
    is configured to enable users to control and monitor their building environment
    through a smartphone device. The SmartThings Hub works to connect the sensors,
    devices and building’s internet router to one another and to the cloud. It is
    compatible with different communication protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and
    IP-accessible devices. In addition, the SmartThings is compatible with other sensors
    and devices such as thermostats, moisture sensors, motion sensors, presence sensors,
    locks and garage door openers [63]. HomeOS [64] is Microsoft’s home operating
    system platform, that can be installed on a personal computer. It is an open platform
    that is not limited to Windows-based devices [65], [66]. with HomeOS platform,
    applications can be installed to maintain various context-aware functionalities,
    for example, taking an image by a door camera and sending it to the occupant when
    someone rings the doorbell. HomeOS provides a PC-like abstraction that manages
    and extends the technology of network devices to the users and developers in the
    smart building environment. Its design enables the users to map their protocol-independent
    services to support the applications with simple APIs, a kernel, and protocols
    of specific devices. HomeOS usually runs on an allocated computer such as a home
    gateway, it does not need any adjustments to commodity devices. HomeOS usually
    utilizes (i) Datalog-based access control to facilitate the process of managing
    technology in the smart home (ii) a kernel to incorporate the devices and applications
    and (iii) protocol-independent services to allow the developers manageable access
    to the devices. Lab of Things (LoT) [67], [68] is an experimental research platform
    that utilizes connected devices in the buildings. LoT offers a framework that
    provides deployment capabilities such as remote monitoring and updating of system
    health, and logging data collected from different appliances in cloud storage.
    It enables data sharing and collecting, sharing codes, connect hardware sensors
    to the software platform, and participants using HomeOS. The platform is designed
    to make it simple to design solutions that can be deployed in IoT based smart
    services such as healthcare, energy management services as it works in combination
    with HomeOS. Eclipse Smarthome [69] is a framework that has a focus on heterogeneous
    environments such as smart building and ambient assisted living. This platform
    takes to consider a variety of existing communication mechanisms. Eclipse SmartHome
    works as an abstraction and translation framework that enables communications
    across system and protocol boundaries. It provides many relevant implemented extensions,
    protocols, and standards that are significant for smart building services. Those
    implementations can be of Java library or an OSGi bundle shapes so that they can
    be utilized independently from the rest of the project. The framework can work
    on different embedded devices such as a BeagleBone Black, an Intel Edison, or
    a Raspberry Pi. Extensions of Eclipse SmartHome are compatible with the solutions
    provided by different vendors. This means your code that is written for a specific
    purpose can be extended easily on commercial platforms. Eclipse SmartHome offers
    a variety of characteristics to allow you to design a special Smart Home solution
    for your expectations [70]. Apart from discussing various SB solutions, we will
    also highlight the popular simulator called Cooja is used widely by the research
    community to produce small simulations for relatively large wireless networks
    of embedding sensors and actuators; and connected devices, in order to develop,
    debug and evaluate systems based on the wireless sensor network technology. Cooja
    simulator is a Java-based wireless sensor network simulator. It is distributed
    with Contiki OS project. Cooja enables the emulation of the set of sensor nodes,
    in addition, it can simulate physical and application layers of the system [71].
    There are three basic properties for the simulated node in Cooja: Its hardware
    peripherals, node type, and data memory. The node type can be shared among multiple
    nodes and defines properties that are common to all these nodes [72]. Summary:
    The field of SBs contains a variety of technologies, across commercial, industrial,
    institutional and domestic buildings, including building controls and energy management
    systems. Several organizations and institutions are working to supply buildings
    with technology that enables the residents to adopt a single device to control
    all electronic devices and appliances. In this section, we discussed the various
    components for SBs including sensors and actuators, smart control devices, smart
    gateway, networking and software platforms. SECTION IV. Ml Background for SBS:
    Models, Tasks, and Tools Massive data generated from sensors, wearable devices,
    and other IoT technologies provide rich information about the context of users
    and building status and can be used to design SB management. This context information
    is needed to extract useful and interesting insights for various stakeholders.
    When the data volume is very high, developing predictive models using traditional
    approaches does not provide accurate insight and we require newly developed tools
    from big data. Big data is primed to make a big impact in SBs and is already playing
    a big role in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries
    [73], notably for waste analytics [74] and waste minimization [75]. ML is a powerful
    tool that facilitates the process of mining a massive amount of data that have
    been collected from different sources around us and make sense of a complicated
    world. ML algorithms apply a model on new data by learning the model from a set
    of observed data examples called a training set. For example, after being trained
    on a set of sample accelerometer data marked as walking or jogging, an ML algorithm
    can classify the future data points into walking and jogging classes. ML makes
    it relatively easy to develop advanced software systems without much involvement
    from the human side. They are applicable to many real-life problems in SB environments.
    One can also design and develop self-learning and collaborative systems. ML does
    not remove the human element from data science—it draws on computers’ strengths
    in handling big data to complement our understanding of semantics and context.
    It only needs training data to extract better features or parameters required
    to improve a given system. ML algorithms can be used to make predictions based
    on data patterns. It enables the computer to learn from the fed input data without
    being explicitly programmed so that ML algorithms can learn from and make predictions
    on input data [76], [77]. Nest thermostat is an example of a device that applies
    a specific temperature in a specific room and at a certain time of day according
    to the occupants’ preference. There are devices such as Amazon’s Echo that can
    learn from voice patterns, and the others those learn from much more complex behavior
    and activity patterns. A. Ml Models ML techniques have been widely used to develop
    smart systems which can sense and react according to context modifications in
    SBs [78]. There are many different ML algorithms, according to the two well-known
    theorems No Free Lunch theorem and Ugly Duckling theorem. No Free Lunch theorem
    states “there are no algorithms that can be said to be better than any other”,
    without prior information about the problem, any two algorithms may perform equally
    well in solving a problem. While Ugly Duckling theorem states “we cannot say that
    any two different patterns would be more similar to each other than any other
    pairs.” [79]. Mainly, ML is categorized into four categories handling different
    types of learning tasks as follows: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
    semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms Figure 7 shows
    ML styles. These categories are described next and a summarized comparison between
    these ML techniques is presented in Table 5. TABLE 5 Comparison of ML Techniques
    FIGURE 7. ML styles. Show All 1) Supervised Learning refers to developing algorithms
    based on a labeled training dataset, from which the learner should generalize
    a representation by building the system model that represents the relations between
    the input, output and system parameters. ML model is developed through a training
    process that continues on the input training data until the model reaches the
    desired level of accuracy [80], [81]. Some examples of common supervised ML algorithms
    are: naive Bayes model, decision tree, linear discriminant functions such as support
    vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models
    (HMMs), instance-based learning (such as k-nearest-neighbor learning), ensembles
    (bagging, boosting, random forest), logistic regression, genetic algorithms, and
    logistic regression [82], [83]. Supervised learning approaches are extensively
    used to solve different problems in smart buildings. Application in SBs: Boger
    et al. [76] proposed a supervised learning system using Markov decision processes
    to help people with dementia the process of hand washing. Altun et al. [84] make
    a comparative study on the supervised human activity classification approaches
    using body-worn miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. Mozer [85] developed
    the occupant comfort control of the home environment system using neural networks
    and reinforcement learning to control air heating, lighting, ventilation, and
    water heating in the smart home environment. Bourobou et al. [86] presented a
    hybrid approach using ANN and K-pattern clustering to identify and predict user
    activities in the smart environments. Hsu et al. [87] proposed a TV recommendation
    system using a neural network model based on user personalized properties such
    as activities, interests, moods, experiences, and demographic information data.
    Fleury et al. [88] proposed a healthcare-focused smart home system using the SVM
    algorithm to classify daily living activities based on the data from the different
    sensors. Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into classification,
    regression, time series, and ensemble method problems. a: Classification The task
    of classification algorithms is to classify an instance into a specific discrete
    set of possible categories. Given two sets of data (labeled and unlabeled datasets),
    the labeled dataset is used for the training process, while the unlabeled dataset
    will be used to evaluate of the classification results. The normal process is
    to count the number of instances that are assigned to the right category, which
    is also known as the accuracy rate (AR) defined by [21]. The classification algorithm
    can mathematically be described as follows: AR= N c N t (1) View Source where
    N c denotes the number of test instances that are correctly assigned to their
    categories to which they belong; N t the number of test instances. The precision
    ( P ) and recall ( R ) are used to measure the details of the classification results.
    The four possible outcomes are true positive ( TP ), false negative ( FN ), false
    positive ( FP ), and true negative ( TN ), the precision ( P ) and recall ( R
    ) are generally defined as: P= TP TP+FP (2) View Source Given P and R , a simple
    method to describe the precision and recall of the overall classification results,
    called F-score or F-measure, is defined as: F= 2PR P+R (3) View Source Commonly
    used classification techniques include decision trees, SVM, rule-based induction,
    neural networks, deep learning, memory-based reasoning, and Bayesian networks
    [89]. b: Decision Tree Algorithms The decision tree method is an important predictive
    ML modeling approach, which constructs a model of decisions presented based on
    the actual values of features in the data. Decision trees can be utilized for
    both classification and regression problems. In tree structures, leaves represent
    class labels and branches represent conjunctions of attributes that drive to those
    labels [90]. The decision trees that the target variable takes continuous values
    called regression trees. Decision trees are often one of the favorites of ML algorithms
    because of its speed and accuracy. The most common algorithms for decision tree
    are [91]: classification and regression tree, ID3, C4.5 and C5.0, Chi-squared,
    M5, and conditional decision trees. Application in SBs: Delgado et al. [92] propose
    an ML technique based on decision trees to extract the most frequent activities
    of human behavior and the temporal relationship of those activities in order to
    produce the human behavior quickly in a smart environment. Viswanathan et al.
    [93] introduce a prototype distributed data mining system for healthcare environment
    using C4.5 classification algorithm that can provide the patient monitoring and
    health services. Decision trees algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm that is
    easy to interpret and explain. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that
    it can easily overfit. c: Bayesian Algorithms Bayesian methods utilize Bayes’
    theorem for classification and regression problems. The most common Bayesian algorithms
    are [94]: Naive Bayes, Gaussian naive Bayes, Bayesian belief network, Bayesian
    network. Application in SBs: Parnandi et al. [95] propose an indoor localization
    approach based on Naive Bayes classification and dynamic time warping, they exploit
    the embedded sensors of smartphones to determine the building that the user entered
    and the activities that the user is performing inside the building. Verbert et
    al. [96] proposed an ML approach based on Bayesian network to diagnosis the fault
    in HVAC systems. The model has been constructed based expert knowledge concerning
    conservation laws, component interdependencies, and historical data using virtual
    sensors. Naive Bayes classifier approaches have been applied with potential results
    for human activity recognition in [97], [98]. Naive Bayes approach recognizes
    human activities that identify with the highest probability to the set of sensor
    readings that were observed. d: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML
    algorithm which can be applied for both classification and regression problems
    though mostly used in classification challenges [140]. SVM is one of the most
    popularly utilized for many statistical learning problems, such as face and object
    recognition, text classification, spam detections, handwriting analysis etc. [141].
    is maximizing the margin that separating between the hyperplane of two classes’
    closest points. Support vectors are the points lying on the boundaries, and the
    optimal separating hyperplane is the middle of the margin [142]. Application in
    SBs: Fu et al. [105] proposed an SVM method to predict the system level electricity
    loads of public buildings that have electricity sub-metering systems. A real-time
    human tracker system proposed Nguyen et al. [106] using SVM for predicting and
    recognizing human motion based on the input images from a network of four cameras
    in the ubiquitous smart homes. Petersen et al. [107] developed an SVM model to
    predict the times where visitors are present in the home using only the data provided
    by wireless motion sensors in each room. Fleury et al. [88] presented a study
    for automatic recognition of daily living activities in a smart home based on
    SVM. They collected the data from various sensors such as Infra-Red Presence Sensors,
    door contacts, temperature and hygrometry sensor, and microphones. Das et al.
    [108] proposed a one-class classification approach for a real-time activity error
    detection in smart homes using one-class SVM. Zhao et al. [143] proposed an ML
    approach based on SVM and RNN to detect the occupancy behavior of a building through
    the temperature and heating source information for the energy efficiency consumption
    purposes. e: Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (ANNs) ANN models are inspired
    by the process of biological neural networks. ANN models are commonly utilized
    for regression and classification problems. The common ANN algorithms are [94]:
    Perceptron, Back-Propagation, Hopfield Network, and Radial Basis Function Network
    (RBFN). ANNs provide a number of advantages including it requires less statistical
    training, it has the capacity to detect complex nonlinear relationships between
    the predictor and response variables, as well as the ability to detect all possible
    relationships between predictor variables [104]. On the other hand, disadvantages
    include its “black box” nature, heavy computational burden and proneness to overfitting.
    However, due to the inherent features of neural networks, it has the following
    main limitations: challenge in training with no local optima, its accommodation
    to modifications in the behavior, the validation process of the results, and the
    complexity of network performance interpretation. Application in SBs: Badlani
    and Bhanot [99] developed a smart home system for energy efficiency applying pattern
    recognition based on ANNs, the system incorporates an RNN to capture human behavior
    patterns and an ANN for security applications in smart homes. Other researchers
    have applied ANNs to present context-aware services. Campo et al. [100] developed
    a system that calculates the probability of occupation for each section of the
    building and compares the probability with the current situation systematically.
    See [101] for a survey paper focusing on the role of ANNs for smart home services.
    Ermes et al. [102] proposed a hybrid classifier approach using a tree structure
    comprising a priori knowledge and ANN to recognize the activities such as rowing,
    biking, playing football, walking, running, sitting, or hiking. Ciabattoni et
    al. [103] proposed a home energy management system design using the neural network
    algorithm to predict the power production of the photovoltaic plant and the home
    consumptions during the given time. f: Deep Learning Algorithms: Deep learning
    methods represent an evolved form of ANNs in which a deep architecture (many layers
    comprising multiple linear and non-linear transformations [144]) is used. One
    of the promises of DL is replacing the manually selected features with efficient
    unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction
    algorithms. The most common DL algorithms are [145]: Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Belief
    Network (DBN), and Stacked Auto-Encoders. Deep learning has been used successfully
    in varieties of big data analytics applications, particularly natural language
    processing (NLP) applications, medical diagnosis, stock market trading, network
    security, and image identification. Deep learning is now ubiquitously used in
    major businesses and companies. Microsoft research on a deep learning system presented
    real-time speech translation system between Mandarin Chinese and English languages
    [146]. Apple’s Siri uses a deep learning trained model, and the voice recognition
    in the Google Android phone also uses a deep learning trained model [147]. DL
    utilizes a number of techniques such as drop-out and convolutions that enables
    the models to learn efficiently from high-dimensional data. However, DL requires
    much more data to train compared to other algorithms because of the magnitudes
    of parameters for estimation required by the models. Application in SBs: Choi
    et al. [114] propose two prediction algorithms deep belief network and restricted
    Boltzmann machines based on the DL framework for predicting different human activities
    in a building. They also presented a hybrid model which combines for predicting
    human behavior. The paper [115] proposes a generic deep learning framework based
    on convolutional and RNNs for human activity recognition that is suitable for
    multimodal wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes or magnetic field
    sensors. Alsheikh et al. [116] proposed a hybrid approach of DL and hidden Markov
    model for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers. Baccouche
    et al. [117] propose a two-steps neural-based deep model to classify human activities,
    the first step of the model is automatically learned spatiotemporal features based
    on Convolutional Neural Networks. Then the second step of the model uses an RNN
    to classify the entire sequence of the learned features for each time-step. In
    [118], they propose an acceleration-based human activity recognition method using
    Convolution Neural Network. In [119] a deep convolutional neural network as the
    automatic feature extractor and classifier for recognizing human activities is
    proposed using the accelerometer and gyroscope on a smartphone. Hammerla et al.
    [148] explore the performance of deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches
    of deep learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors. For the
    sake of measuring the performance, the authors used three representative datasets
    that comprise motion data collected from wearable sensors. g: Hidden Markov Models
    (Hmm) An HMM is a doubly stochastic process with a hidden underlying stochastic
    process that can be observed through the sequence of observed symbols emitted
    by another stochastic process. Application in SBs: Wu et al. [113] proposed an
    improved HMM to predict user behaviors in order to provide services for people
    with disabilities. They developed a temporal state transition matrix to be utilized
    instead of the fixed state transition matrix. Lv and Nevatia [112] used hidden
    Markov models for both automatic recognition and segmentation of 3-D human activities
    to allow real-time evaluation and feedback for physical rehabilitation. Cheng
    et al. [110] proposed an inference engine based on the HMM that provides a comprehensive
    activity of daily living recognition capability. They integrated both Viterbi
    and Baum-Welch algorithms to enhance the accuracy and learning capability. Chahuara
    et al. [111] proposed sequence-based models for online recognition of daily living
    activities in an SB environment. They presented three of sequence-based models:
    HMM, conditional random fields, and a sequential Markov logic network. h: Time
    Series Analysis A time series is a collection of temporal instances; time series
    data set usually have the following characteristics include the high dimensionality,
    large number of instances, and updating continuously [149]. One of the important
    purposes for time series representation is to reduce the dimension, and it divides
    into three categories: model-based representation, non-data-adaptive representation,
    and data-adaptive representation [150], [151]. Application in SBs: Survadevara
    et al. [125] proposed a wellness model using seasonal autoregression integration
    moving average time series with sleeping activity scenario in a smart home environment
    to forecast the elderly sleeping tendency. Zhou et al. [126] proposed a time series
    analysis framework to explore relationships among non-stationary time series in
    the case of data sensors in SBs. Jakkula and Cook [127] propose a time series
    based framework to determine temporal rules from observed physical and instrumental
    activities of occupants in a smart home. i: Regression The aim in regression problems
    is to estimate a real-valued target function. It is related to representing the
    relationship between variables that are repeatedly processed utilizing a measure
    of error in the predictions made by the model [152]. The most common regression
    algorithms are [153]: linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression,
    and ordinary least squares regression. Application in SBs: Chen et al. [120] used
    the regression technique of orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to identify
    the physical and environmental parameters that providing the energy efficiency
    in an SB. Bouchard et al. [121] presented a gesture recognition system using linear
    regression combined with the correlation coefficient to recognize the gesture
    direction and estimate the segmentation of continuing gestures of daily usage
    activities in a smart environment. j: Ensemble Methods A combination of multiple
    classifiers often referred to as a classifier ensemble, group of classification
    models that are trained separately and the predictions of those models are then
    combined in a way to produce the overall prediction [154]. The most popular ensemble
    learning based classification techniques are [155]: random forest, boosting, gradient
    boosting machines, AdaBoost, bagging, and blending. Application in SBs: Jurek
    et al. [122] proposed a cluster-based ensemble approach solution for activity
    recognition within the application domain of smart homes. With this approach,
    activities are modeled as cluster collections built on different subsets of features.
    Fatima et al. [123] proposed an ensemble classifier method for activity recognition
    in smart homes using genetic algorithm optimization to merge the prediction output
    of multiple classifiers that make up the ensemble. They used the ANN, HMM, conditional
    random field, and SVM [13] as base classifiers for activity recognition. Guan
    and Ploetz [124] proposed a deep LSTM ensemble method for activity recognition
    using wearables: more specifically, the authors developed modified training procedures
    for LSTM networks and proposed the combination of sets of diverse LSTM learners
    into classifier collectives. 2) Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning refers
    to developing algorithms that use data with no labels to analyze the behavior
    or the system being investigated [156]. Thus, the algorithm does not know about
    the truth of the outcome. In other words, the unsupervised learning algorithm
    classifies the sample sets to different clusters by investigating the similarity
    between the input samples. Clustering is done using different parameters taken
    from the data which enable us to identify correlations which are not so obvious.
    The inferring structures existing within the input data is used to prepare the
    model to prepare and extract general rules of the model. A mathematical process
    might be used to systematically reduce redundancy, or organize data by similarity
    [129]. The unsupervised approach has been applied to recognize various activities
    in smart buildings when it is challenging to have labels for input data [130].
    Common unsupervised learning problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction,
    and association rule learning. There are a variety of commonly used unsupervised
    learning algorithms, some of those algorithms are based on supervised-learning
    algorithms: the Apriori algorithm and k-Means. In unsupervised learning, usually
    there is no a measure for the output; we recognize only the features and the target
    is to define the patterns and relationships among a set of input measures [80].
    The major disadvantage of unsupervised learning is the absence of direction for
    the learning algorithm, hence, there might not be any useful detected knowledge
    in the selected set of attributes for the training. Clustering is a method of
    unsupervised learning that involves detecting patterns in the data by placing
    each data element into a group of K-clusters, where each group holds data elements
    most similar to each other [157]. Unsupervised learning problems can be categorized
    into clustering and association problems, which are described next. a: Clustering
    A clustering problem explores the internal groupings in the input data, such as
    grouping customers by their purchasing habits. Clustering techniques are usually
    organized by modeling strategies such as centroid-based and hierarchical. All
    methods are concerned with handling the internal structures in the input data
    to properly organize the data into groups of maximum commonality [158]. The quality
    of the clustering result is evaluated depends on the type of application that
    utilizes a clustering algorithm. For example, the sum of squared errors is generally
    utilized for data clustering while the peak-signal-to-noise ratio is used for
    image clustering [21]. The most common clustering algorithms are [153]: k-Means,
    k-Medians, expectation maximization, and hierarchical clustering. Application
    in SBs: Fahad et al. [128] propose an activity recognition approach that combines
    the classification with the clustering, in their approach the activity instances
    are clustered using Lloyd’s clustering algorithm. Then, they apply evidence theoretic
    K-Nearest neighbors learning method that combines KNN with the Dampster Shafer
    theory of evidence. The paper [86] proposes a hybrid approach to recognize and
    predict user activities in a smart environment. They use the K-pattern clustering
    algorithm to classify so varied and complex user activities, and ANN to recognize
    and predict users’ activities inside their personal rooms. Lapalu et al. [82]
    used an unsupervised learning approach to address the issues of daily living activities’
    learning in smart home. They utilize the Flocking algorithm for clustering analysis
    of a use case in cognitive assistance service that assists the people suffering
    from some type of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Aicha et al. [83] present
    an unsupervised learning approach for detecting abnormal visits of an elderly
    in a smart home environment based on a Markov modulated Poisson process model.
    The model combines multiple data streams, such as in the front-door sensor transitions
    and the general sensor transitions. The other cases of social communication services,
    Rashidi and Cook [129] applied an unsupervised learning approach to detect social
    interaction and monitor activity daily living in a smart space, their approach
    can adapt and update automatically to reflect the changes in discovered patterns
    from implicit and explicit identified feedbacks of the occupant. Rashidi et al.
    [130] introduce an unsupervised method that identifies and tracks the normal activities
    that commonly occur in an individual’s routine in a smart environment. The activity
    discovery method of the system is produced to cluster the sequences based on the
    simple k-means algorithm. Fiorini et al. [159] proposed an unsupervised ML approach
    to identify the behavioral patterns of the occupants using unannotated data collected
    from low-level sensors in an SB. Their approach involves processing and analyzing
    collected data related to the daily living activities of 17 older adults living
    in a community-based home supplied with a variety of sensors. They extract activity
    information from collected data at different times of the day. b: Association
    The association rule learning problem is utilized to identify the rules that define
    large portions of input data, such as people that buy X item also tend to buy
    Y item. Association analysis is performed on rules discovered by analyzing input
    data for frequent if/then statement and using the criteria of support and confidence
    to discover relationships between unrelated data in a relational database or another
    information repository. Here “support” indicates how frequently the items appear
    in the database while “confidence” indicates the number of times the if/then statements
    have been found to be true. Many algorithms for generating association rules have
    been proposed. Apriori algorithm is the most well-known association algorithm
    [160]. Application in SBs: Aztiria et al. [161] proposed system that learns the
    frequent patterns of human behavior using association, workflow mining, clustering,
    and classification techniques. The core part of the system is the learning layer
    which is made up of two modules: the language module, which provides a standard
    conceptualization of the patterns; and the algorithm module, which discovers the
    patterns. Kang et al. [162] proposed a service scenario generation scheme for
    interpreting association rules extracted from the states of all devices in SB
    environments. Typically, These states are collected periodically at a specific
    time interval from the devices. Nazerfard et al. [163] propose a framework to
    discover the temporal features of the activities, including the temporal sequencing
    of activities and their start time and duration using the temporal association
    rule techniques in a smart home. 3) Semi-Supervised Learning Semi-Supervised learning
    lies between supervised and unsupervised methods. Input data is a composite of
    labeled and unlabeled samples. These hybrid algorithms aim to inherit the strengths
    of the main categories while mitigating their weaknesses. The model learns the
    patterns present in the data and also make predictions. Example problems are classification
    and regression [164]. There are some common semi-supervised learning models, including
    generative models, heuristic approaches, semi-supervised SVM, graph-based methods,
    self-training, help-training, mixture models, co-training and multi-view learning
    [94]. Application in SBs: Cook [131] combined fully-supervised and semi-supervised
    learning to recognize and follow activities that support health monitoring and
    assistance context-aware services for people experiencing difficulties living
    individually at smart homes. Liu et al. [132] proposed a vision based semi-supervised
    learning approach for fall detection and recognizing other activity daily living
    in smart environments to overcome the labeling challenges of human activities
    by systematic interpreting the activities with the highest confidence. Fahmi et
    al. [133] proposed a semi-supervised fall detection approach in which a supervised
    algorithm utilizing decision trees in the training process and then profiles are
    used to implement a semi-supervised algorithm based on multiple thresholds. Radu
    et al. [134] present semi-supervised ML method using only the low power sensors
    on a smartphone to consider the problem of determining whether a user is indoors
    or outdoors. Guan et al. [135] propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm for
    activity recognition named En-Co-training to make use of the available unlabeled
    samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number
    of labeled samples. The proposed algorithm extends the co-training paradigm by
    using an ensemble method. 4) Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is
    a learning approach to control a system in order to maximize performance measure
    that represents a long-term objective [165]. Reinforcement learning, an area of
    ML inspired by behaviorist psychology, is concerned with the way that software
    agents have to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the concept
    of cumulative reward. RL algorithms learn control policies, particularly when
    there is no a priori knowledge and there is a massive amount of training data.
    However, RL algorithms suffer from some drawback such as the high computational
    cost required to find the optimal solution, such that all states need to be visited
    to choose the optimal one. The well-known approaches of RL are Brute force, Monte
    Carlo methods, Temporal difference methods, and Value function [166]. Q-learning
    [167] is a model-free reinforcement learning approach based on learning the required
    utility given a state decision. Application in SBs: Mozer [136] applied Q-learning
    for lighting regulation to predict the time of turning the lights ON/OFF in a
    building. This prediction model can be utilized to schedule the lights’ activations
    in a building for efficient energy consumption proposes. Li and Jayaweera [137]
    proposed a Q-learning based approximate dynamic programming algorithm to provide
    a more efficient, flexible and adaptive method. This approach can enable customers
    to make an optimal on-line decision making in SB environment to maximize the profits
    based on both local fully observable and the estimated hidden information of the
    building. Khalili and Aghajan [138] proposed a temporal differential class of
    RL method for autonomous learning of a user’s preference of music and lighting
    service settings in presence of different states of the user in SB environment.
    The preferences are learned by the model by using the explicit or implicit feedback
    from users when they react to the provided service. Xu et al. [139] give a survey
    of developments in RL algorithms with function approximation. They evaluated and
    compared different RL algorithms using several benchmark learning, prediction,
    and learning control tasks. B. ML Tasks for SBS In this section, we will describe
    the major ML tasks that are relevant to SB. The reader is referred to Figure 8
    for a general depiction of ML tasks in SBs and the steps taken to implement ML
    in an SB environment. FIGURE 8. ML tasks in SB environment. Show All 1) Data Collection
    and Acquisition A variety of data collection approaches are used, each of which
    has different deals in terms of capabilities, energy efficiency, and connectivity.
    Sensors and similar objects in SBs produce raw data simultaneously in an automated
    way and such devices may store the data for a specific period of time or report
    it to controlled components [168]. Data can be collected at gateways; the collected
    data is then filtered and processed, fused into compact forms for efficient transmission.
    A variety of communication technologies such as Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular are
    utilized to transfer data to collection points. Data collected from a global-scale
    deployment of smart things defines the basis for decision making and providing
    services. It is possible that the decisions are unreliable when the quality of
    utilized data is poor [169]. Zhao et al. [170] propose a data acquisition and
    transmission system which could be used for monitoring systems to collect energy
    consumption data (e.g., electricity, water, gas, heating, etc.) from terminal
    meters which are installed in buildings. The system stores the data periodically
    after analyzing and processing it and finally transmits the data to servers through
    the Ethernet. Rowley et al. [171] propose the data acquisition and modeling approaches
    that can support the delivery of building energy infrastructure in both new building
    and renovated real-world contexts. Such methods provide a means to achieve short,
    medium and long-term forecasting of possible scenario pathways to multi-objective
    sustainable outcomes. CLEEN MMEA [172] platform that collects, processes, and
    manages the data and initiates contextual knowledge extraction. The purpose is
    to establish an online marketplace to collect data and provide services for different
    companies. The interfaces are made public so that any company can easily join
    the network to buy or sell services. The analysis results can be given to an energy
    services company in order to allow offering the service to the owners. A typical
    example of open access data collection system is e3Portal [173] developed by VTT
    in collaboration with Finnish municipalities. e3Portal offers information and
    tools when planning savings measures and energy retrofitting in municipal buildings.
    It also involves frequently updated data regarding energy and water consumption
    in thousands of public buildings like schools, kindergartens, offices, hospitals,
    other health care facilities, etc. Decision makers, designers, operation and maintenance
    personnel, as well as buildings users, can utilize it. There are projects that
    provide publicly available SB datasets for researchers to conduct further studies;
    A list of “Home Datasets” [174] includes the datasets collected by projects from
    UC Berkeley, MIT, Washington State University, University of Amsterdam, University
    of Edinburgh, and the University of Tokyo. The WARD [175] project supported by
    NSF TRUST Center at UC Berkeley provides a benchmark dataset for human action
    recognition using a wearable motion sensor network. The dataset was collected
    from 13 repetitive actions by 13 male and 7 female participants between the ages
    of 19 and 75. An MIT project [176] collected daily live activities dataset from
    two single-person apartments within a period of two weeks. Eighty-four sensors
    to record opening-closing events were attached to different appliances and devices
    such as drawers, refrigerators, containers, etc. Banos et al. [177] introduced
    an open benchmark dataset collected from various inertial sensors attached to
    different parts of the body. They considered 33 fitness activities, recorded using
    9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. The CASAS project [178] at Washington
    State University provides a publicly-available dataset for a three-bedroom apartment
    with one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Different types of motion and
    digital sensors are installed to support temperature readings, in addition, the
    analog sensors are installed to support readings for hot water, cold water, and
    stove burner use [179]. The PlaceLab project [180] of MIT provides a dataset collected
    from a one-bedroom apartment with more than 900 sensors, including those coming
    from motion, switch and RFID sensors. That is being used to monitor activity in
    the environment in the context of a smart home [181]. A collection of smart meters
    data from five houses in the UK [182] That consists of 400 million instances.
    The active power is formed by different appliances and the whole-house power demand
    every 6 seconds. The major challenges that arise for data collection are scalability,
    privacy, security, and heterogeneity of resources [183]. Automated sensor data
    collection process collects a large amount of data that overwhelms the collection
    and analysis centers in comparison to the data collected from other sources such
    as IoT devices and social media. This leads to a huge number of small synchronous
    write operations to the database storage system, consequently, resulting in serious
    performance bottlenecks to the storage system design [184]. Because of the extensive
    use of RFID technology, privacy issues arise in data collection; for example,
    the RFID tags carried by a person may become a unique identifier for that person.
    Also, other security concerns appear, for example, the radio signals of RFID technology
    are easily jammed. Hence, that can disrupt the data collection process [185].
    The heterogeneity of data that is being collected from different resources is
    another major challenge, such that the data are usually very noisy, large-scale,
    and distributed. This makes it very difficult to use the collected data effectively
    without a clear description of existing data processing techniques [184]. 2) Data
    Preprocessing A large amount of data are generated by sensors in SBs; this data
    comes from various sources with diverse formats and structures. Usually, this
    data is not ready for analysis as it might be incomplete or redundant due to low
    battery power, poor calibration, exposure to various malicious elements and interference.
    Therefore, raw data typically needs to be preprocessed to deal with missing data,
    discard noisy and redundant data and integrate data from various sources into
    an integrated schema before being committed to storage. This preprocessing is
    called data cleaning. The quality of data can be improved substantially by applying
    some cleaning techniques to the data before it arrives its end user [168], [186].
    Data cleaning is one of the significant tasks in the data processing phase. Data
    cleaning is not a new process particular for the IoT data processing. It has already
    been applied as a process for database management systems. Presenting a data cleaning
    method would further aid the applications to focus on their core logic without
    worrying about data reliability post-processing overheads [184]. There are many
    different techniques that have been utilized to deal with the problem of cleaning
    noisy data streams such as Kalman filters [187], statistical models [186] and
    outlier detection models [184]. One of the major challenges with data cleaning
    techniques in the SBs is the heterogeneity of data collected from different sources
    particularly WSN- and RFID-enabled data streams. The utilized data cleaning techniques
    should be able to deal with several different variables of interest to satisfy
    IoT applications’ requirements, for example, setting home temperature based on
    observed outer temperature, user habits, energy management, etc. [169] Any type
    of failures such as a failed sensor, network issues, camera failure, or database
    crashes in the process of collecting data would invalidate the data. Consequently,
    this type of impediment will dramatically increase the time required to collect
    data [179]. 3) Dimensionality Reduction There are huge volumes of raw data that
    are captured from heterogeneous and ubiquitous of sensors used in SBs. Most of
    the data collected from those sensors are redundant and they need to be brought
    down to a smaller number of features by applying dimensionality reduction techniques
    without losing significant information [188]. The main idea from the dimensionality
    reduction strategy is to find a new coordinate system in which the input data
    can be represented with much fewer features without losing significant information.
    The dimensionality reduction can be made in two different ways: by extracting
    of the features that represent the significant data characteristics (this technique
    is called feature extraction), or by only selecting the most relevant features
    from the original dataset, this method is called feature selection [189], [190].
    Like clustering methods, the dimensionality reduction approach explores and exploits
    the internal structure of the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner
    using less information. Most of these techniques can be utilized in classification
    and regression problems. Examples of some salient algorithms are [153]: Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA). Chen et al. [191] propose a framework using the classification
    information of local geometry of data to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset
    on human activity recognition from wearable, object, and ambient sensors. a: Feature
    Extraction The main components of the original data are the features. After extracting
    the features from the raw dataset, such features contain important information
    that is used by the learning algorithms for the activities discrimination. The
    most common methods of feature extraction work in time, frequency, and discrete
    domains [192]. Among time domain method, mean and standard deviation are the key
    approaches for almost all sensor types. While the frequency domain method focuses
    on the periodic structure of the collected data. Wavelet Transformation and Fourier
    Transform are the most common approaches. And discrete domain methods such as
    Euclidean-based distances, dynamic time warping, and Levenshtein edit distance
    are key approaches implemented in several applications such to string similarity,
    classifying human activities and modeling human behavioral patterns [16], [193].
    b: Feature Selection The main role of feature selection is to discriminate the
    most related subset of features within a high dimensional vector of features,
    so that reduces the load of noise and computational expense on the learning models.
    In order to map the high dimensional vector of features into a lower dimensional
    vector, there are several common algorithms used such as Linear Discriminant Analysis
    (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis
    (ICA) [194]. Hausmann and Ziekow [195] proposed an approach for automatically
    adapting the feature selection for SBs application ML models from the time-series
    data based on wrapper methods and genetic optimization. Fahad et al. [196] propose
    an activity recognition approach for overlapping activities using K-Nearest neighbors
    approach that distinguishes the most important features from the collected information
    obtained from deployed sensors in multiple locations and objects. Fang et al.
    [197] determine that the different feature sets generate different levels of accuracy
    for recognizing human activities, and selecting inappropriate datasets increases
    the level of computational complexity and decreases the level of prediction accuracy
    in smart home environments. The wrapper and filtering are the two main statistical
    methods of feature selection problem. It is argued that although the wrapper approach
    may obtain better performances, filters are less resource intensive and faster
    [198]. In [199], different feature selection methods are utilized for the process
    of dimensionality reduction of the learning problem to recognize the human activities
    from observed sensors. The authors show that the performance of the learning models
    to recognize the human activity has a strong relationship with the utilized features.
    c: Feature Projection feature projection can be represented as a mapping from
    the original set of features to an appropriate set that optimizes the learning
    criterion, such that the feature projection approach allows the process of visualizing
    and mapping the high-dimensional feature vectors to low dimensional one, in addition,
    it enables analyzing the distribution of the reduced feature vectors [200]. Consequently,
    the feature projection approach reduces the pattern recognition’s processing time
    and enables selecting the best-performed classifier for the reduced feature vectors.
    Hence, it makes real-time implementation possible [198]. Chu et al. [201] proposed
    a linear supervised feature projection that utilizes the LDA algorithm for EMG
    pattern recognition that attempted to recognize nine kinds of hand motion. C.
    ML Tools & Platforms for SBs There are a variety of existing ML platforms and
    tools to support the learning process. With the current increasing number of those
    kinds of toolkits, the task of selecting the right tool for processing big data
    streaming from various sources can still be difficult. Typically, there is no
    single toolkit that truly fits and provides solutions for all different problems.
    Many of the available toolkits might have overlapping uses, and each has advantages
    and disadvantages. Most of those toolkits might require experiences in the domains
    of programming languages and system architecture. In addition, usually many people
    lack a full understanding of the capabilities and how to use those available platforms
    [202]. The important factors that must be considered when selecting a specific
    ML tool are scalability, speed, coverage, usability, extensibility, and programming
    languages support. With respect to the scalability factor, the size and complexity
    of the data should be considered to determine if a specific toolkit will be fit.
    The processing platform that the library is running on and the complexity of the
    algorithm affect the speed factor. Not all the projects prioritize the speed factor;
    if the models require frequent updates, the speed may be a crucial concern; but
    not otherwise. Coverage represents the number of ML algorithms implemented in
    the tool. With the massive amount of data capturing from heterogeneous sources,
    ML community faces the challenges of how the ML model can efficiently process
    and learn from the big data. In general, the available big data tools do not implement
    all varieties of different classes of ML algorithms, and typically their coverage
    ranges from a few algorithms to around two dozen. The usability factor includes
    elements such as initial setup processing; continuous maintenance; the available
    programming languages and user interface available; the amount of documentation,
    or availability of a knowledgeable user. The extensibility factor means that the
    implementations introduced in the tools can be utilized as building blocks towards
    new systems. It is necessary to evaluate tools in terms of how well they are able
    to meet this factor. There are a variety of ML libraries that are available in
    different programming languages. Depending on the task you are trying to accomplish,
    certain languages, libraries, and tools can be more effective than others. The
    following provides a detailed observation of the strengths and weaknesses of the
    top used deep learning and ML tools. The reader is also referred to Table 6 for
    a concise tabulated summary of the described deep learning and ML tools. TABLE
    6 Comparison Between Deep Learning and ML Tools 1) H2O H20 [203] is an open-source
    in-memory, distributed, and scalable ML framework for big-data analysis that supports
    ML libraries, along with tools for parallel processing, analytics, data preprocessing
    and evaluation tools. It is produced by the H2O.ai, which launched in 2011 in
    Silicon Valley. The most notable feature of this product is that it provides numerous
    tools for deep neural networks. The H2O software APIs can be called from Python,
    Java, R, and Scala. Users without programming expertise can still utilize this
    tool via the web-based User Interface. In addition to the processing engine provided
    by H2O framework, it also allows the users to integrate their models with other
    available frameworks such as Spark and Storm. Depending on what is suitable for
    the algorithm, The H2O’s engine uses multiple execution methods to process data
    completely in memory. The general technique used is distributed Fork/Join, which
    is reliable and suitable for massively parallel tasks. The H2O software can be
    run on different operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
    (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04; CentOS), It also runs on Apache Hadoop Distributed File System
    (HDFS) and Spark systems for big-data analysis. In addition, it can operate on
    various cloud computing environments such as Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine,
    and Microsoft Azure. As of July 2016, the algorithms supported in H2O cover the
    tasks classification, clustering, generalized linear models, statistical analysis,
    ensembles, optimization tools, data preprocessing options and deep neural networks.
    2) MLlib (Spark) MLlib [204] is Apache Spark’s ML library. MLlib aims to provide
    scalable and easy to use ML methods. It includes common ML algorithms for classification,
    regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, as well as lower-level optimization
    primitives and higher-level pipeline APIs. The classification techniques of SVM,
    random forest, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, decision trees, and gradient-boosted
    trees are supported whereas for clustering, k-means, Gaussian mixture, and power
    iteration clustering are supported. MLLib supports implementations for linear
    regression and isotonic regression, and incorporates a collaborative filtering
    algorithm using alternating least squares. PCA is supported for dimensionality
    reduction. MLlib includes APIs for development in Scala, Java, Python, and SparkR.
    Generally, MLlib depends on Spark’s iterative batch and streaming approaches,
    as well as its use of in-memory computation. 3) Tensorflow Tensorflow [205] is
    an open source software library for numerical computation and deep ML in a variety
    of perceptual and language understanding tasks utilizing data flow graphs. TensorFlow
    was originally developed by the Google Brain team and was released in November
    2015 under an Apache 2.0 open source license. TensorFlow has tools that support
    deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other algorithms. TensorFlow implements
    data flow graphs, where “tensors” are batches of data that can be processed by
    a set of algorithms defined by a graph. The movements of the data through the
    system are called “flows”—hence, the name. TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs
    and GPUs. It can run on Linux, Mac OS X desktop, and server systems, and Windows
    support on roadmap, as well as on Android and Apple’s iOS mobile computing platforms.
    TensorFlow is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine that makes it run
    fast. TensorFlow utilizes a symbolic graph of vector operations method, in order
    to easily define a new network. However, TensorFlow has a weakness that is related
    to modeling flexibility. Such that each computational flow has to be constructed
    as a static graph. That makes some computations such as beam search difficult.
    4) Torch Torch [206] is an open source ML computing framework that supports a
    variety of ML algorithms. Torch was originally developed at NYU. It is efficient
    and easy to use, thanks to a script language based on the Lua programming language
    and a C/CUDA implementation, Torch was intended to be portable, fast, extensible,
    and easy to use in development. Some version of Torch is employed by large companies
    such as Google DeepMind, the Facebook AI Research Group, IBM, Yandex, and the
    Idiap Research Institute. In addition, it has been extended to run on Android
    and iOS platforms. A variety of community-contributed packages for Torch, giving
    it a versatile range of support and functionality. It provides various deep learning
    algorithms that support computer vision; signal, image, video, and audio processing;
    parallel processing and networking [207]. 5) Deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j [221]

    deep belief networks, convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, deep
    autoencoder, stacked denoising autoencoder, and recursive neural tensor network.
    All these algorithms can be integrated with Hadoop and Spark for distributed parallel
    processing. Deeplearning4j relies on Java programming language, in addition, it
    is compatible with Clojure and includes a Scala API. Deeplearning4j is designed
    to be utilized in business environments, rather than as a research tool. It is
    applied in a variety of applications such as fraud detection, anomaly detection,
    recommender systems, and image recognition. 6) Massive Online Analysis (Moa) MOA
    [222] is one of the common open source frameworks for data stream mining and possessing.
    MOA is written in Java related to the WEKA project that developed at the University
    of Waikato, New Zealand. It includes a set of learners and stream generators that
    can be used from the GUI, the command-line, and the Java API. MOA supports a variety
    of ML algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection,
    as well as some tools for evaluation [223]. 7) Caffe Caffe [224] is a DL framework,
    it is primarily developed with the consideration of expression, speed, and modularity.
    It utilizes the machine-vision library for fast convolutional networks from Matlab,
    which has been ported to C and C++. It is developed by the Berkeley vision and
    learning center and by the community contributors. In Caffe, multimedia scientists
    and practitioners have an organized and state-of-the-art toolkit for DL algorithms.

    astronomy. In addition, it supports Python and MATLAB code bindings. Caffe offers
    image classification with state of the art CNN algorithm. Caffe is mainly utilized
    as a source of pre-trained models hosted on its Model Zoo site. Caffe is useful
    for performing image analysis using CNNs and regional analysis within images using
    RCNNs. The performance and processing speed of Cafee make it as one of the most
    utilized platforms for research experiments and industry deployment. It has the
    capability to process over 60 million images per day with a single NVIDIA K40
    GPU. Caffe has already been applied in many research projects at UC Berkeley and
    other universities, performing very well in many tasks such as object classification,
    object detection, and Learning Semantic Features. It provides a complete and well-documented
    toolkit for training, testing, tuning, and deploying models. Caffe utilizes a
    large repository of pre-trained neural network models called the Model Zoo, which
    is suitable for a variety of common image classification tasks [225]. 8) Azure

    enables users to create and train models, then convert those models into APIs
    that can be applied to other services. Users can get up to 10GB of storage per
    account for model data, although they can also connect their own Azure storage
    to the service for larger models. programmers can use either the R or Python programming
    language for developing with Azure services. Users can purchase ML algorithms
    from Microsoft Azure Marketplace, they can also obtain free algorithms from the
    community gallery that has been created by Microsoft to share ML algorithms with
    each other. They share many of predictive analytics of personal assistant in Windows
    Phone called Cortana. Azure ML also utilizes solutions from Xbox and Bing. Azure
    currently supports different features and capabilities such as run Hadoop over
    Ubuntu Linux on Azure, it also supports hosting Storm for analyzing data streams.
    In addition, it allows developers to connect.NET and Java libraries to Storm.
    Azure ML studio supports a variety of modules for training, scoring, and validation
    processes. Azure ML comes with a large library of algorithms for predictive analytics.
    The popular families of algorithms are regression, anomaly detection, clustering,
    and classification. D. Real-Time Big Data Analytics Tools for SBS Several applications
    need to have real-time data analysis for stream data and waiting for the information
    to be archived and then analyzed is not practical for these type of applications.
    Generally, Stream processing is intended to analyze a massive amount of data and
    act on real-time streaming data utilizing continuous queries such as SQL-type
    queries to handle streaming data in real-time utilizing scalable, available and
    fault-tolerant architecture. Essential to stream processing is Streaming Analytics.
    More and more tools offer the possibility of real-time streaming data. The following
    presents some of the common and widely used options. 1) Apache Storm Storm [227]
    is an open source distributed real-time data processing framework that provides
    massively scalable event collection. The initial release was on 17 September 2011,
    it was created by Nathan Marz and the team at BackType, and is now owned by Twitter.
    Storm can easily process unlimited streams and with any programming language.
    It has the capability to process over one million tuples per second per node with
    a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and reliable architecture. Storm is written
    in Java and Clojure. Trident is a high-level abstraction layer for Storm, can
    be utilized to accomplish state management persistence. Storm is a system of complex
    event processing. This type of solution allows companies to respond to the arrival
    of sudden and continuous data (information collected in real-time by sensors,
    millions of comments generated on social networks such as Twitter, WhatsApp and
    Facebook, bank transfers etc.). Some of the specific applications of Storm include
    customer service management in real-time, operational dashboards, data monetization,
    cybersecurity analytics, and threat detection. 2) Apache Kafka Kafka [228] is
    a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant and durable open-source message broker project
    that originally developed by LinkedIn, and subsequently open sourced in early
    2011 and released by Apache Software Foundation on 23 October 2012. Kafka is written
    in Scala. It supports a variety of use case scenarios with a focus on high throughput,
    reliability, and scalability characteristics. For example, it can message sensor
    data from heating and cooling equipment in office buildings. 3) Oracle In 2013,
    Oracle started utilizing Oracle Enterprise Manager that includes Oracle Big Data
    Appliance to manage all of its big-data technologies. Oracle has also produced
    multiple low-latency technologies for Oracle Fast Data components includes Oracle
    Event Processing, Coherence, NoSQL, Business Analytics, and Real-Time Decisions.
    Oracle Event Processing provides solutions for building applications to filter,
    correlate and process events in real-time. It supports IoT services by delivering
    actionable insight on data streaming from a variety of data sources in real-time
    [229]. Oracle Stream Explorer (OSX) and Oracle R Enterprise (ORE) aim to support
    equipment monitoring applications for the systems that made of a variety of components
    through sensors, anomaly detection and failure prediction of such systems. ORE
    [230] is utilized to handle low-frequency streams in batch mode, while OSX handles
    the high-frequency streams making real-time predictions and sends the results
    back to user applications that are communicating with the output channels. OSX
    [231] is a middleware platform has the capability to process large amounts of
    streaming data in real-time for a variety of streaming data applications, from
    a multitude of sources like sensors, social media, financial feeds, etc. It streamlines
    real-time data delivery into most popular big data solutions, including Apache
    Hadoop, Apache HBase, Apache Hive, Apache Flume, and Apache Kafka to facilitate
    improved insight and timely action. Oracle Real-Time Decisions [232] is a decision
    management platform with self-learning that determines optimized recommendations
    and actions with messaging, imagery, products, and services within business processes.
    4) Amazon Kinesis Streams Amazon Kinesis [233] is a platform for collecting and
    processing large streams of data on AWS in real-time, AWS launched Kinesis in
    November of 2013, offering powerful services for loading and analyzing streaming
    data, in addition, it provides custom streaming data applications for specialized
    needs. Sometimes Terabytes of data per hour can be generated - that need to be
    collected, stored, and processed continuously from various application services
    such as web applications, mobile devices, wearables, industrial sensors etc. Typically,
    Amazon Kinesis Streams application can use the Amazon Kinesis Client Library and
    reads data from an Amazon Kinesis stream as data records. These applications can
    run on Amazon EC2 instances. 5) Apache Spark Streaming Apache Spark [234] is an
    open-source platform for real-time data processing, it can implement using four
    different languages: Scala, the syntax in which the platform is written; Python;
    R; and Java. Spark Streaming is an extension of core Spark API. It allows building
    fault-tolerant processing of real-time data streams. Spark Streaming allows the
    processing of millions of data among the clusters, and Spark SQL which makes it
    easier to exploit the data through the SQL language. Spark Streaming divides the
    live data stream into a predefined interval of batches, then handles each batch
    of data as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then we can apply operations
    like map, reduce, join, window etc. to process these RDDs. The last results of
    these operations are then returned in batches. Spark Streaming can be utilized
    for a variety of application such as real-time monitoring and analyzing of application
    server logs. These logs messages are considered time series data. Examples of
    such type of data are sensor data, weather information, and clickstream data.
    This data can also be utilized for predicting future states based on historical
    data. Apache assures a computation speed that performs the operations quicker
    by 100 times than what is currently offered by Hadoop MapReduce in memory, and
    10 times better than in disc. Spark can be executed either in independent cluster
    mode or in the cloud on different frameworks such as Hadoop, Apache Mesos, and
    EC2. In addition, Spark can access numerous databases such as HDFS, Cassandra,
    HBase or S3, Amazon’s data warehouse. 6) Apache Flume Flume [242] is a distributed,
    reliable and open-source log data aggregation framework. Apache Flume is applied
    in many applications ranging from log data aggregation, to transport massive quantities
    of event data including network traffic data, social-media-generated data, email
    messages and pretty much any data source possible into the HDFS. The architecture
    of Flume is simple and flexible, it is also robust and fault tolerant with tunable
    reliability mechanisms for failover and recovery. log manufacturing operations
    is an example of Flume’s application. The a massive log file data can stream through
    Flume. The log file data can be stored in HDFS and analyzed by utilizing Apache
    Hive. 7) Apache Samoa SAMOA [243] is a distributed streaming ML framework that
    contains programming abstractions for distributed streaming ML algorithms. Its
    name stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis and was originally developed
    at Yahoo! Labs in Barcelona in 2013 and has been part of the Apache incubator
    since late 2014. SAMOA is both a platform and a library. It enables the algorithm
    developer to reuse their code to run on different underlying execution engine.
    In addition, it supports plug-in modules to port SAMOA to different engines. By
    utilizing SAMOA, the ML algorithm developer does not need to worry about the complexity
    of underlying distributed stream processing engines. They can run it locally or
    utilizing one of stream processing engines, such as Storm, S4, or Samza. SAMOA
    provides the ML algorithms for a variety of tasks including classification, regression,
    clustering, along with boosting, and bagging for ensemble learning. Additionally,
    it offers a platform for the implementation of these ML algorithms, as well as
    a framework that enables the user to write their own distributed streaming algorithms.
    For example, there is CluStream for clustering, as well as Vertical Hoeffding
    Tree, which uses vertical parallelism on top of the decision tree, or Hoeffding
    tree for classification. There is also Adaptive Model Rules Regressor, which uses
    both vertical and horizontal parallelism implementations for regression [244].
    A summarized comparison between various real-time data analytics tools is provided
    in Table 7. TABLE 7 Comparison Between Real-Time Data Analytics Tools TABLE 8
    Categorized Applications of SB SECTION V. Applications of Ml-Based Context-Aware
    Systems for SBs The potential uses of ML in an SB environment can be divided into
    four categories: detection, recognition, prediction, and optimization [79]. We
    discuss these categories separately next. In general, detection is the extraction
    of particular information from a larger stream of information. Many detection
    applications in SBs such as fire detection, leak detection, and anomaly detection
    [245]. Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity
    recognition in SBs; examples include fitness tracking, health monitoring, fall
    detection. [246]. The goal of recognition is to classify an object or an event
    to a predefined category. It focuses on how to make computer programs perform
    intelligent and human-like tasks, such as the recognition of an object from an
    image. The goal of prediction is to determine the temporal relations’ model between
    specific events to predict what will happen in the near future. Prediction can
    be either for classification or regression problems [247]. Event prediction when
    the goal is to predict the most probable event or subsequent activity is an example
    of classification problems, while latency prediction when the output takes on
    continuous values is an example of the regression problem. The general steps of
    applying ML processes to predict an event in an SB environment is shown in Figure
    9. FIGURE 9. Steps involved in applying ML models in an SB environment. Show All
    The goal of optimization, on the other hand, is to maximize the long-term profits
    by making proper decisions in different situations. reinforcement learning can
    be utilized with these problems. Some optimization problems can be managed as
    prediction problems such that the profits for different actions are predicted
    and the action with the highest profit would be selected. Decision making is the
    most common case of the optimization problem. It takes to consider a variety of
    variables and solving deals between the profits of different locations of the
    environment [248]. Smart buildings are becoming increasingly supplied with a variety
    of sensors that measure different parameters, and data from these sensors is analyzed
    by ML algorithms and used for a range of services and applications for the activities
    of the building occupants. SBs go far beyond saving energy and contributing to
    sustainability goals. The application and services provided by the SBs can be
    both residential and commercial ranging from e-health, e-marketing, intelligent
    car parking system, intelligent transportation system, automation, and logistics
    services. Figure 10 shows the taxonomy of basic domains of SB services. Lighting
    services are associated with the well-being of occupants depending on their activities
    in SBs that have sensors to conserve energy when lights are not needed. The power
    and electrical system may have onsite renewable energy sources to provide a percentage
    of power consumption in SBs. Waste management is related to the activities and
    actions required to collect, separate, transport, together with monitoring and
    regulation of waste management system in SBs. The security is related to managing
    automated locks, biometric devices as well as video surveillance systems in SBs.
    The communications center is related to connecting sensors and actuators in the
    building as well as the operations control center. The operations control center
    supports system analytics and decision making for the operations. Visual interfaces
    provide a dashboard that shows the status of SB services and human operators to
    better manage the building resources. These interfaces also allow the occupants
    to set up their optimal parameters for comfort and productivity improvement on
    daily activities. HVAC stands for the humidity, ventilation and air conditioning
    system, intended for the convenience of occupants that have effective interaction
    with the environment. Parking services aim to minimize the area and volume required
    for parking cars. It could support car sharing, electric vehicles and a place
    for bicycles as well. Finally, the water management services aim to increase savings
    and manage water reclamation for flushing, landscaping and air-cooling systems.
    FIGURE 10. SB services taxonomy. Show All Based on our literature survey, we have
    identified that the application areas of SBs can be elderly care, comfort/entertainment,
    security/safety, energy management, and other projects. In the rest of the section,
    we will briefly describe the major domains in providing the following SB services:
    (1) care of the elderly population; (2) enhancing energy efficiency; (3) enhancing
    comfort or providing entertainment; (4) enhancing safety and security; and (5)
    miscellaneous projects. a: Elderly Population’s Home Care SB technology such as
    sensors, voice activation, GPS, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity via mobile phones,
    smartphone monitoring apps and sophisticated computers can be especially useful
    for elderly or disabled individuals who live independently. Elderly persons can
    take the advantages of such technologies (e.g., monitoring system, emergency system,
    dangerous kitchen appliance detection, fall detection), to maintain a safe and
    healthy lifestyle while living independently [56], [249]. Smart technology in
    the SBs aims to collect real-time information on human daily activity and then
    learn of their personal patterns. ML techniques have the potential for a very
    wide array of new innovations in healthcare that will be transformative for both
    providers and their patients. Whenever a deviation from the norm patterns is detected,
    SB systems send the alerts to family members and the caregivers in order for them
    to take urgent response action. By using big data analytics and ML algorithms
    it is possible to analyze large-scale data contained in electronic medical records—e.g.,
    to learn automatically how physicians treat patients including the drugs they
    prescribe [250]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Chernbumroong
    et al. [56] proposed an activity recognition and classification approach for detecting
    daily living activities of the elderly people applying SVM. They used wrist-worn
    multi-sensors namely accelerometer, temperature sensor and altimeter for detection
    basic five activities namely feeding, grooming, dressing, mobility, and stairs.
    And other instrumental activities such as washing dishes, ironing, sweeping and
    watching TV. Taleb et al. [251] proposed a middleware-level solution that integrates
    both the sensing and the monitoring services for assisting elders at smart homes
    environment. The appliances used in the proposed framework include RFID readers
    that cover of the whole building, sound sensors, video cameras, smart door lock,
    microphone and speakers for interaction with the system. CAALYX [252] is a European
    Commission-funded project that supports older people’s autonomy and self-confidence.
    The service is formed of three distinct subsystems including elderly monitoring
    subsystem, home monitoring subsystem and the caretaker’s monitoring subsystem.
    The system delivers a high priority message to an emergency service including
    the geographic position and clinical condition of the elder user. EasyLine+ [253]
    project funded by the European Commission to support elderly people with or without
    disabilities in carrying out a longer independent life at home. The system uses
    a neural network, assistive software, and a variety of sensors such as illumination
    sensor, temperature sensor, door sensors, and RFID giving the capacity of controlling
    the white goods. Hossain et al. [254] proposed a cloud-based cyber-physical multi-sensory
    smart home framework for elderly people that supports gesture-based appliance
    control. Suryadevara et al. [255] proposed a model for generating sensor activity
    pattern and predicting the behavior of an elderly person using household appliances.
    b: Energy Efficiency When temperatures rise or fall in various zones of your home,
    heaters, air conditioners, fans, and other devices will turn on or off (or increase
    or decrease in speed or temperature). In order to perform an efficient energy
    consumption of the supply systems, a significant step that is necessary by analyzing
    the way that current energy consuming system is using in buildings [256]. In the
    last decade, analysis of the energy efficiency in the smart spaces has received
    increasing attention. Various approaches for energy efficiency have been proposed
    utilizing predictive modeling based on profile, climate data, and building characteristics
    [32], [257]. For instance, lights throughout your home might turn on and off depending
    on the time of day. In the past, various attempts have been made to improve energy
    efficiency in the SBs through the use of smart metering and sensor networks at
    the residential level facilities. It is a fact that these types of infrastructure
    are becoming more widespread but due to their variety and size, they cannot be
    directly utilized to make conclusions that help to improve the energy efficiency.
    ML approaches will be the key to the handling of energy efficiency problem in
    SBs. Learning about the occupants’ consumption habits is capable of generating
    collaborative consumption predictions that help the occupant to consume better
    [258]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Reinisch et al.
    [259] developed an optimized application of AI system for SB environment. The
    system focuses on some capabilities like ubiquity, context awareness, conflict
    resolution, and self-learning features. The system operates on a knowledge base
    that stores all the information needed to fulfill the goals of energy efficiency
    and user comfort. Jahn et al. [260] proposed an energy efficiency features system
    built on top of a Hydra middleware framework [261]. The system provides both,
    stationary and mobile user interfaces for monitoring and controlling a smart environment.
    Pan et al. [262] proposed an IoT framework that uses smartphone platform and cloud-computing
    technologies to improve the energy efficiency in SBs. They built an experimental
    testbed for energy consumption data analysis. Fensel et al. [263] proposed the
    SESAME-S project (SEmantic SmArt Metering - Services for energy efficient houses).
    The project focuses on designing and evaluating the energy efficiency services
    to enable the end-consumers in making the right decisions and controlling their
    energy consumption. The system combines a variety of smart building components,
    such as smart meters, a variety of sensors, actuators, and simulators that can
    integrate virtual appliances such as the washing machine. Vastardis et al. [264]
    proposed a user-centric smart-home gateway system architecture to support home-automation,
    energy usage management, and smart-grid operations. The gateway is supported by
    ML classification algorithms component such as C4.5 and RIPPER that is able to
    extract behavioral patterns of the users and feed them back to the gateway. Irrigation
    systems monitoring and smart watering system that keep track of rain and soil
    conditions and irrigate appropriately are a very cost-effective way to reduce
    outdoor water consumption. Investment in water management software and services,
    water-efficient plumbing, and irrigation management delivers economic and sustainability
    benefits. Water conservation and management is an example of such benefits [265].
    c: Comfort/Entertainment One of the main goals of SB research is to facilitate
    user daily life activities by increasing their satisfaction and comfort level.
    SBs supports automated appliance control and assistive services to offer a better
    quality of life. They utilize context awareness techniques to optimize the occupant’s
    comfort based on predefined constraints of conditions in a building environment.
    Typical examples of comfort services include lighting, background music, automation
    of routine activities, advanced user interfaces based on voice or gestures, etc.
    [30]. Other services related to comfort services in SB environments are Indoor
    Climate Control and Intelligent Thermostat [265]. Indoor Climate Control: Measurement
    and control of temperature, lighting, CO2 fresh air. In the SB environment, HVAC
    systems play an essential role in forming indoor environmental quality. Typically,
    HVAC systems are produced not only to heat and cool the air but also to draw in
    and circulate outdoor air in large buildings [266]. Kabir et al. [267] present
    a context-aware application that provides the service according to a predefined
    preference of a user. They use the KNN classifier to infer the predefined service
    that will maximize the user’s comfort and safety while requiring minimum explicit
    interaction of the user with the environment. Ahn et al. [268] proposed a deep
    learning model that estimates periodically the atmospheric changes and predict
    the indoor air quality of the near future. d: Safety/Security As the SB technology
    progresses, the role of ML and deep learning in security and connected devices
    will increase. Deep learning will continue to help gain insights using big data
    that were previously inaccessible, particularly in image and video. Advanced technologies
    such as behavioral analysis and ML to detect, categorize, and block new threats
    will be beneficial. In a traditional home system, as soon as a fire is detected
    the Fire/smoke detectors are activated and start sending a fire alarm. However,
    SB can perform much better than the traditional system. It not only sends an alarm
    but also turns on the light only in the safest route and guides the occupants
    of the building out, as well as it will unlock the doors and windows for smoke
    ventilation, turn off all the devices and call the nearest fire service station.
    Other than this, it can take video of the areas surrounding the building, provide
    the status of window breakage alarms, and automatically lock all the doors and
    the windows when the last person of the house leaves [30]. The main services for
    security and safety in SBs are: Perimeter Access Control, Liquid Presence, Intelligent
    Fire Alarm, Intrusion Detection, and Motion Detection Systems [265]. Perimeter
    Access Control service provides control to restricted areas and detects non-authorized
    users that access the areas. Access card provides a variety of solutions that
    allow staff members, vendors or contractors to access specific areas at specific
    times you designate. The same access card can also be utilized to check employee
    attendance. In addition, there is widespread use of biometric technology including
    fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scans [269]. Additionally, liquid presence
    detection technique has been utilized in data centers, warehouses, and sensitive
    building grounds to prevent breakdowns and corrosion in such areas [270]. Intelligent
    Fire Alarm and its corresponding safety systems are crucial parts of an intelligent
    building. It is a system with multi-function sensors (i.e., chemical gas sensors,
    integrated sensor systems, and computer vision systems) These sensors enable measuring
    smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the building. They also can give warnings,
    howling alarms, and tell with a human voice about the place and level of smoke
    and CO. In addition, they can give a message on a smartphone if the smoke or the
    CO alarm goes off [271]. Examples of intrusion detection systems including window
    and door opening detection and intrusion prevention [265]. An infrared motion
    sensor is utilized to detect the motion in a specific area in the building. This
    sensor can reliably send alerts to the alarm panel, with the system implementing
    algorithms for adaption to environmental disturbances and reducing any false alarms
    [265]. Image recognition solution can be used in security software to identify
    people, places, objects, and more. It can also be used to detect unusual patterns
    and activities. Clarifai [272] specializes in a field of ML known as “computer
    vision” that teaches computers to “see” images and video. Clarifai’s technology
    can play a key role in security surveillance and at present, the company works
    only with home security. Each image is processed on a pixel by pixel basis through
    convoluted neural networks. Bangali and Shaligram [273] proposed a home security
    system that monitors the home when the user is away from the place. The system
    is composed of two methods: one uses a web camera to detect the intruder—whenever
    there is a motion detected in front of the camera, a security alert in terms of
    sound and an email is delivered to the occupant. And the other one is based on
    GSM technology that sends SMS. A home security system that sends alert messages
    to the house owner and police station in case of illegal invasion at home is proposed
    in [274]. The system consists of different sensor nodes as the input components
    while the output components respond to the signal received from the input components.
    The sensor nodes consist of a thief alarm, presence detecting circuit, and the
    break-in camera. Zhao and Ye [275] proposed a wireless home security system that
    utilizes low cost, low power consumption, and GSM/GPRS. The system has a user
    interface and it can respond to alarm incidents. e: Miscellaneous Projects CASAS
    [178] is a project by Washington State University that provides a noninvasive
    assistive environment for dementia patients at SBs. The project focuses on three
    main areas for SBs: medical monitoring, green living, and general comfort. CASAS
    project comprises of three layers: physical layer, middleware layer, and software
    applications layer. Aware Home Research Initiative (AHRI) [276] is a project that
    has constructed by a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology for SB services
    in the fields of health and well-being, digital media and entertainment, and sustainability.
    AHRI utilizes a variety of sensors such as smart floor sensors, it also utilizes
    assistive robots for monitoring and helping the elderly. House_n [277] is a multi-disciplinary
    project leads by a group of researchers at the MIT. The main objective of the
    project is to facilitate the design of the smart home and its associated technologies,
    products, and services. The home is supplied with hundreds of various sensors
    that are installed almost in every part of the home that and being utilized to
    develop user interface applications that enable the users to control and monitor
    their environment, save resources, remain mentally and physically active, and
    stay healthy. The EasyLiving project [278] at Microsoft Research is concerned
    with the development of a prototype architecture and technologies to aggregate
    diverse devices into a coherent user experience for intelligent environments.
    The EasyLiving project was designed to provide context-aware computing services.
    The project utilizes a variety of sensors and cameras to track and recognize the
    human activities in the room by using the geometric model of a room and taking
    readings from sensors installed in the room. The Gator Tech Smart House project
    [279] is a programmable space specifically designed for the elderly and disabled
    developed by The University of Florida’s mobile and pervasive computing laboratory.
    The project’s goal is to create SB environments that can sense themselves and
    their residents. The project provides special cognitive services for the residents
    such as mobility, health, and other age-related impairments. A generic middleware
    is utilized to integrate system components in order to maintain a service definition
    for every sensor and actuator in the building. The components of the middleware
    including separate physical, sensor platform, service, knowledge, context management,
    and application layers [280]. Other well-known smart home projects include DOMUS
    [281] which is a research project, by the University of Sherbrooke in Canada,
    that supports mobile computing and cognitive assistance in smart buildings. The
    project aims to assist people suffering from Alzheimer’s type dementia, schizophrenia,
    cranial trauma, or intellectual deficiencies. Adaptive House project [136] at
    The University of Colorado has constructed a prototype system that is equipped
    with a variety of sensors that provide different environmental information including
    sound, motion, temperature, light levels. In addition, actuators that control
    the space and water heaters; lighting units, and ceiling fans. In Asia, there
    are also some other smart building projects have been developed, such as “Welfare
    Techno House” project, which is equipped with different sensors such as ECG, body
    weight, and other temperature measured indicators [282]. Ubiquitous Home project
    [283] is another smart building project in Japan, which utilizes RFID, PIR, pressure
    sensors, as well as cameras and microphones for monitoring elderly adults. Summary:
    Recently, several different context-aware and ML techniques have been utilized
    to support SB services. ML-based approaches are capable to perform better prediction
    and adaptation than others. The philosophy behind ML is to automate the learning
    process that enables algorithms to create analytical models with the support of
    available data. ML can be applied in different learning styles including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement
    learning when the learning is the result of the interaction between a model and
    the environment. The general uses of ML for SB services are detection, recognition,
    prediction, and optimization. In the section, we also talked about how to acquire
    the context from multiple distributed and heterogeneous sources and the techniques
    for modeling and processing such context to be used in the application services
    of SBs. We also talked about the most used tools and platforms ML and others for
    real-time data analytics by ML community to efficiently process and learn from
    big data. Without such ML tools, one would have to implement all of the techniques
    from scratch requiring expertise in the techniques and in efficient engineering
    practices. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Research on
    SBs has made great strides in recent years, but a number of challenges remain.
    We present some major challenges related to SBs in this part of the work. These
    challenges will channelize the research directions for future SBs. A. Security
    and Privacy Wherever there is an interconnection of two systems or networks (wired
    or wireless), there are issues of security and privacy and the same is true in
    the case of SB. Security is an essential role in SB environments. Any SB application
    should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. Access control must be
    included in SB systems, for instance, the unauthorized users should not be able
    to disconnect the alarm system by connecting the pervasive system [284]. There
    is a massive amount of streaming that is collected from the various installed
    sensors and appliances, such data needs to be processed and stored. Hence, cloud
    computing services can be utilized for this purpose. However, with all of this
    data that is transmitted, the issue of losing the privacy increases. Therefore,
    different encryption techniques are needed to preserve personal privacy [285].
    There are specific challenges related to the user’s privacy including challenges
    related to the data privacy of personal information and the privacy of the individual’s
    physical location and tracking. That needs for privacy enhancement technologies
    and relevant protection laws and tools for identity management of users and objects
    [286]. The recent trend of ML research has focused on handling security and privacy
    issues in SB environments. There are different security-related services have
    utilized ML techniques, such as determining safe device behavior by detecting
    and blocking activities and potentially harmful behavior [287]. ML techniques
    have the potential to reduce security gap because of their capability to learn,
    identify and detect the users’ habits and behaviors. Consequently, it can detect
    the abnormal behaviors predicting risks and intrusions before they happen. For
    instance, ML models learn the routine of the users, such as the time they get
    home or go to sleep. These models can suggest rules based on those detected behaviors
    from all connected devices [288]. B. SBS and Context-Aware Computing In the SB
    environment, there exists a massive amount of raw data being continuously collected
    about the various human activities and behaviors. It is important to develop techniques
    that convert this raw data into valuable knowledge [289]. Context awareness and
    ML techniques are expected to provide great support to process and store big data
    and create important knowledge from all this data [290]. The process of data interpretation
    and knowledge extraction has the following challenges including addressing noisy
    real-world data and the ability to develop further inference techniques that do
    not have the limitations of traditional algorithms. Usually, It is very complex
    to formalize and model the contextual information related to human behaviors in
    a standard way due to the complex physiological, psychological and behavioral
    aspects of human beings [291]. The humans communicate through rich languages as
    well as gestures and expressions. Modern ubiquitous computer systems lack an automatic
    mechanism of inferring information as the humans do. New research is necessary
    to raise human activities and behaviors recognition to understand the complex
    dependencies between the apps and humans [292], [293]. The context-aware prompting
    systems have essential applications in SBs such as emergency notifications, medication
    prompting, heart rate monitoring, generation of agenda reminders, and weather
    alerts. However, issuing prompts for all detected errors can possibly be false
    positives, and consequently, lead to annoyance and sometimes prove to be unsafe
    for specific activities. ML methods can be used for an accurate and precise prediction
    when a person faces difficulty while doing daily life activities [294]. C. Personal
    Data Stream Management in SBS The data streaming management system is able to
    process and transfer raw data collected from a variety of sensors to information,
    it is also able to fuse this information to a feature and directly process features
    [295]. While the data processing for a single SB is simple, it is more complex
    when processing the data from multiple SBs, because there are different people
    that tend to share less common interests and have opposing interests concerning
    the processed data [296]. The simple sensors in an SB environment can detect different
    events related to temperature, motion, light, or weather. Moreover, other appliances
    like a television and a telephone can also send their status or other data as
    events. All this data from different sensors can be used by SB services to detect
    specific states and send a request to some actuators according to specific predefined
    rules, for instance, turn on the light if the television is used [297]. However,
    this approach is not generalizable in case of a group of people residing in the
    same building. Although it can work well for one certain person when personal
    preferences can be automatically learned for an individual person, therefore each
    of the residents has to define their own set of rules [298]. Because of the increasing
    number of sensors that produce data streams, the traditional analyzing and processing
    techniques of these data streams are mostly impractical now [299]. Despite the
    availability of new tools and systems for handling massive amounts of data continuously
    generating by a variety of sensors in SBs, however, the real promise of advanced
    data analytics to still lies beyond the realm of pure technology [296]. In [300]
    discuses research challenges for data streams of real-world applications. They
    analyze issues concerning privacy, timing, preprocessing, relational and event
    streams, model complexity and evaluation, availability of information, and problems
    related to legacy systems. D. Big Data Challenges in SBS Nowadays, a variety of
    sensing technology in the SBs can be utilized to collect a massive amount of heterogeneous
    data at a reasonable cost. Typically, hundreds of thousands of transactions can
    be generated by a single SB every day. The process of storing this data over the
    long-term is challenging [258]. We can imagine the challenges and opportunities
    that the companies or government will encounter in the future to manage incoming
    data from dozens of SBs. This new data could provide us with more contextual information
    that consequently leads to much better services to the occupants [301]. In the
    world of big data, despite the availability massive amount of data, however, it
    is not necessarily easy to obtain valuable information from this data utilizing
    the traditional approaches like trial and error to extract meaningful information
    from this data. Analyzing these massive amounts of data requires new technologies
    to store, organize, and process big data effectively, it needs high-performance
    processors that enable uncovering the insights in big data. It also requires flexible
    cloud computing services and virtualization techniques, as well as software such
    as Apache Hadoop and Spark [302]. It requires providing appropriate ML techniques
    which differ from the traditional approaches for effective and efficient solution
    of the above issues. For these reasons, researchers have recently started to think
    about the problems and opportunities resulting from the adoption of big data in
    SB environments [303], [304]. The information extracted from this big data has
    significant value and could greatly contribute in the future of SBs as assistive
    tools and for better services delivery. That is why it is necessary that the researchers
    start to analyze and think about the solutions for the current and future challenges
    of big data in SBs [305]. E. Interoperability Interoperability means that two
    (or more) systems work together unchanged even though they were not necessarily
    designed to work together. When equipment, devices or appliances having different
    communication and networking technologies can communicate effectively, interoperability
    is satisfied. It is a challenge to ensure that an SB that has various components
    will be intelligible. Typically, each of these components might have been produced
    by different vendors, each of which may have created under different design constraints
    and considerations [306]. Therefore it becomes essential to satisfy interoperability
    so that a number of heterogeneous communication and networking technologies could
    coexist in various parts of SBs. For example, an energy management system may
    use Wi-Fi and ZigBee for communication purposes. A lot of work can be done in
    this context [307]. F. Reliability We can expect that the reliability is one of
    the main concern of occupants and developers of SB systems. A variety of appliances
    and devices present in SB such as televisions, microwave, washing machines etc.
    are required exceedingly to be reliable. Achieving expected levels of reliability,
    especially when linked with communication technologies utilized with these devices
    that may be expected in SBs, is a great challenge. There are different reasons
    for these challenges differences in technological approaches, regulations, development
    culture, and the expectations of the market [306]. G. Integration The key to a
    successful SB implementation is integration: linking building systems such as
    lighting, power meters, water meters, pumps, heating, and chiller plants together
    using sensors and control systems, and then connecting the building automation
    system to enterprise systems. Integration allows executives to gain smart-building
    benefits, both in new construction and by gradually transforming existing buildings
    into SBs. What these SBs have in common is integration. Generally, the integration
    in SB systems brings a range of benefits from energy savings to productivity gains
    to sustainability. The SB systems can be attached to enterprise business systems
    to add another level of intelligence that enhances decision-making and improves
    building performance [2]. However, integrating multiple systems is very challenging
    as each individual system has its own assumptions, strategies to control the physical
    world, and semantics. As an example of integrating two systems in SB, assume a
    system that is responsible for energy management, and another system for health
    care are running concurrently. In this case, the integrated system should not
    turn off medical appliances to save energy while they are being used as suggested
    by the health care system [292]. As a future perspective for SBs, You will wake
    up to the sound of the alarm, at the same time the available sensors will be aware
    that you are waking up. The other sensors such as light sensors will automatically
    turn on the light in the building, while the thermostat will warm the area that
    you are about to use in the building. Your coffee will start to brew, you will
    also get a notification on your phone about the weather. The other sensors in
    the kitchen and refrigerator will remind you with a list of items that you will
    need to pick up on your way from your workplace to home to make dinner. When you
    leave your house, you can press a button from your phone to self-drive your car
    out of the garage. After that, the security system will start monitoring and controlling
    the home. Such the doors will automatically lock. Appliances will switch to an
    energy-saving mode. When the home sensors sense utilizing geofencing technology
    that you are way back home, it will get ready again for your arrival, the thermostat
    will warm things up, the garage door will open as you pull up, and your favorite
    music will start to play when you walk in [141]. Summary: Although the recent
    researches have been done in the SBs field, there is a need for a lot more efforts;
    however, we believe that SBs are possible for the mass market in the near future.
    The main challenges and future research directions of this eld can be summarized
    as follows: User context in term of behavior and intention should be studied and
    respected whenever possible; Further research is needed into context-aware prompting
    systems, personal data streaming and big data analysis of occupants in SB environment;
    Some of the other challenges like the interoperability, reliability, and integration
    still require more attention. SECTION VII. Conclusions The promise of smart buildings
    (SBs) is a world of appliances that anticipate your needs and do exactly what
    you want them to at the touch of a button. Since SBs and their inhabitants create
    voluminous amounts of streaming data, SB researchers are looking towards techniques
    from ML and big data analytics for managing, processing, and gaining insights
    from this big data. This paper reviewed the most important aspects of SBs with
    particular focus on what is being done and what are the issues that require further
    research in ML and data analytics domains. In this regards, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey of the research works that relate to the use of ML and
    big data particularly for building smart infrastructure and services. Although
    the recent advancements in technologies that make the concept of SBs feasible,
    there are still a variety of challenges that limit large-scale real-world systems
    in SBs field. Addressing these challenges soon will be a powerful driving force
    for advancements in both industrial and academic fields of SB research. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    \ of Internet of things (IoT)-oriented modern technologies is\nrevolutionizing\
    \ all ﬁelds of human activities, leading several beneﬁts and allowing to strongly\n\
    optimize classic productive processes. The agriculture ﬁeld is also aﬀected by\
    \ these technological\nadvances, resulting in better water and fertilizers’ usage\

    \ by some decades, is undergoing to rapid evolution in methodologies and techniques,\n\
    for improving the productivity and the environmental sustainability; nowadays,\
    \ the development of\nnew technologies allows to implement an intensive resources\
    \ exploitation (e.g., soil, water, fertilizers,\netc.), with the aim to produce\
    \ high-quality fruits and vegetable products in suﬃcient quantities to satisfy\n\
    food requirements while maintaining competitive costs. In particular, intensive\
    \ agriculture allows to\nsatisfy the primary needs of the population in constant\
    \ growth, but, on the other hand, it has caused\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632; doi:10.3390/s20133632\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n2 of 43\nserious ecological\
    \ and environmental damages such as deforestation, desertiﬁcation, the unregulated\n\
    use, namely the abuse of pesticides and fertilizers and consequently the ground-water\
    \ pollution.\nTherefore, the aim is to achieve sustainable agriculture from the\
    \ ecological and environmental point of\nview and obviously also in terms of economic\
    \ compatibility. A key factor to obtain this result is the\ncorrect and optimized\
    \ use of the various input resources such as fertilizers, water and plant protection\n\
    products, into the agricultural production processes. Thanks to the development\
    \ of Internet of things\n(IoT)-based technologies, nowadays a huge number of low\
    \ cost and power consumption modules and\nsensors are available to be employed\
    \ in the farmlands, in order to detect and collect precise climate\nand soil data\
    \ as well as information referred to growth or diseases of the cultivated crops\
    \ and send by\nWi-Fi connectivity all the collected data to a cloud software platform\
    \ for the optimized management of\nthe farm.\nThe designed system represents a\
    \ multi-platform complete solution, by employing a smart\nfertigation system assisted\
    \ by an on-ﬁeld custom wireless sensor network (WSN), for supporting\nthe farmer\
    \ and manager along the whole supply chain from the ﬁeld to the product distribution,\
    \ as\nwell as for providing added value services to the customers. In fact, the\
    \ developed system helps the\ndealers and traders to check the transportation\
    \ and storage conditions of the food products, as well\nas their provenience,\
    \ employing a low-power Bluetooth low energy (BLE) smart tag placed inside\nthe\
    \ food container; therefore, the availability of a single multi–functional software\
    \ platform allows\nthe user (both the farmer and costumer) to check all events\
    \ and treatments performed overtime on\nthe products, from the sowing to the consumer\
    \ table. To exploit the multitude of the oﬀered services\nfrom the developed system,\
    \ an integrated on-cloud software platform allows us to manage the crops\nproduction\
    \ and market of the agri-food products and more.\nThe beneﬁts of the developed\
    \ farm optimal management system, integrated with an automated\nfertigation facility,\
    \ can cover several cultivation typologies, such as arboreal cultures, horticulture\n\
    and any type of greenhouses. A low-cost and energetically autonomous fertigation\
    \ system has been\ndeveloped to properly dose and mix the determined amount and\
    \ typology of fertilizer into the water\nto irrigate. Several fertigation systems,\
    \ installed in diﬀerent cultivated lands also far from each other,\ncan refer\
    \ to the same cloud platform and, thus, to the same agronomic database containing\
    \ the data\nderived from the mathematical models for the diﬀerent considered crops.\
    \ In fact, the agronomic\nmodels allow to determine the optimum cultivation parameters,\
    \ such as typologies and amount of\nfertilizers, frequency and time duration of\
    \ irrigations; all these operations are calibrated based on\ncrop typologies,\
    \ weather condition and on the physical and chemical quantities, related to soil\
    \ and air,\nacquired directly on-ﬁeld. The decision-making algorithm is also supported\
    \ by a tree-structured WSN\ninstalled on the land, so allowing to obtain updated\
    \ and real-time data related to the crop conditions.\nAccording to the aforementioned\
    \ functionalities, the proposed system allows us to obtain savings in\nterms of\
    \ water resources, fertilizers placed in the ground and energetic consumption,\
    \ with respect to\nclassic methods, and a complete traceability relative to the\
    \ cultivated products.\nThe software platform receives non-stop the WSN data,\
    \ through the central management unit,\nfrom coordinator nodes and the weather\
    \ forecasts from reliable meteorological websites, respectively\nand then it utilizes\
    \ them in the mathematical agronomic models to support the farmers or agronomists\n\
    in the decision-making processes related to the treatments necessary for the optimal\
    \ growth or any\ndiseases of cultivated crops. In particular, a low-cost and robust\
    \ WSN has been realized by using\ncommercial development modules and sensors;\
    \ besides, through a compact solar harvesting section,\nand minimizing node power\
    \ consumption by means of a suitable ﬁrmware implementation, long\nenergy autonomy\
    \ of each sensor node has been obtained.\nThe decision support system (DSS) implemented\
    \ in the software platform uses always updated\ndatabases on fertilizers and plants’\
    \ protection products, including all technical speciﬁcations and mode\nof use\
    \ that allow the correct selection of the most appropriate product for each speciﬁc\
    \ application or\ntreatment, also concerning the anti-resistance strategies, thus\
    \ becoming an eﬀective tool for adapting\ncultural techniques to the climate changes\
    \ and speciﬁc geographical location. In addition, the developed\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3632\n3 of 43\nsoftware platform allows the traceability of the agri-food\
    \ products ensuring the storage of information\non the treatments undergone by\
    \ the products during the cultivation phases, so allowing then the\ndata viewing\
    \ remotely on the smartphone/tablet of potential consumers interested in purchasing\
    \ the\nproducts. In addition—by using a multi-platform application—the farmer\
    \ or the agronomist can\nidentify, by reading a speciﬁc quick response (QR)-code,\
    \ a portion of the cultivated land and view or\nupdate the related information\
    \ on cultivated crops in this speciﬁc area or ﬁnally can acquire data about\n\
    the performing of a speciﬁc treatment on the cultivated crops.\nFurthermore, a\
    \ tracking and tracing system was designed, based on BLE sensor tag applied\n\
    to the plastic or wooden container, where the fresh or already processed agricultural\
    \ products are\nstored. The low-power consumption BLE tag is equipped with several\
    \ sensors for monitoring the\nparameters useful to determine the freshness status\
    \ and the storing conditions of diﬀerent types of\nfood products (i.e., temperature,\
    \ humidity, total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs)-level, ammonia\n(NH3) and\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2)-concentrations). The variety of detected parameters makes\
    \ the\nrealized device extremely versatile for monitoring diﬀerent food typologies\
    \ (vegetables, meat, ﬁsh, etc.),\nas demonstrated in the literature analysis in\
    \ Section 2.3, a unique feature not found in other competitor\nsystems reported\
    \ in the literature as well as available on the market. Additionally, the developed\
    \ BLE\nsmart tag is reusable for a long time on the same container or, if the\
    \ container is damaged, it can be\neasily removed and applied on another container,\
    \ as following detailed in Section 3.3. In addition,\nthe iBeacon technology is\
    \ exploited to support the tracking system in the monitoring of the agri-food\n\
    stored products on the whole supply chain (SC), so providing a value-added service\
    \ to the consumers.\nAlternating iBeacon phase with low duty-cycle acquisition\
    \ and transmission phases, the developed\nBLE device acts like a reprogrammable\
    \ tag capable to monitor the freshness indexes of the stored food\ntypology. A\
    \ prototype of the BLE smart tag was tested to verify its correct operation and\
    \ evaluate\nthe energy autonomy, which turned out to be about 5.6 months. A mobile\
    \ application was developed\nto remotely monitor the tracking and storing parameters\
    \ acquired by the BLE tags placed inside\nthe containers with the agri-food products.\
    \ Both the BLE tag and tracking system were tested in\ndiﬀerent real operative\
    \ scenarios, by using oranges and frozen codﬁsh ﬁllets placed inside plastic and\n\
    polyethylene containers, demonstrating their correct operation.\nConsequently,\
    \ the developed software platform for the optimized farm management allows\nimplementing\
    \ an innovative business model inspired by the principles of the products’ traceability,\n\
    to guarantee consumers on their quality, as well as of the organically grown food\
    \ and fair trade\nforms of agri-food products. In fact, the on-cloud software\
    \ application speciﬁcally developed for the\ndevelopment of new business models\
    \ provides new forms of fair trade of the food products and other\nimplemented\
    \ services for increasing the potential market of farm agricultural production.\n\
    The manuscript is organized as follows: in the sub-paragraph 1.1, a non-exhaustive\
    \ literature\nanalysis about innovative DSSs applied to agriculture ﬁeld is reported;\
    \ these software tools, based\non data provided from several sources, help the\
    \ farm manager to take correct decisions on cultural\nprocesses as well as to\
    \ prevent or minimize eﬀects of pests and diseases or winter frosts. The following\n\
    paragraph includes an overview of new remotely controlled devices and IoT-based\
    \ technical solutions\ndeveloped for crop monitoring and precision farming. After,\
    \ a literature analysis on the applications of\ntracking and tracing systems for\
    \ agri-food products’ identiﬁcation at the harvest time and subsequent\ntheir\
    \ traceability is reported, so providing a quality certiﬁcation to the consumers\
    \ and an economic\nadvantage to the farmer. Furthermore, in this subsection, the\
    \ most suitable parameters for monitoring\nthe freshness status of rapidly perishable\
    \ food products (e.g., meat, ﬁsh, vegetables, etc.) are identiﬁed\nand discussed.\
    \ In Section 3, a description of the automated fertigation facility integrated\
    \ with the\nWSN located on the farmland is provided with technical details on\
    \ its functionalities and related to the\ndiﬀerent mechanical, hydraulic and electrical\
    \ systems. In addition, the architecture of the developed\nBLE sensor tag for\
    \ the traceability system of agri-food products is described, applied to the most\n\
    commonly used containers, made in plastic, wood or polystyrene, for foods’ transport\
    \ or storage. In\nSection 4, the analysis of power consumption related to the\
    \ sensor node during the diﬀerent operating\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n4 of 43\n\
    phases is reported in order to estimate the lifetime of the used lithium polymer\
    \ (LiPo) battery recharged\nby the solar energy harvesting system; in Section\
    \ 4.1, the operation of the developed tracking system\nbased on BLE sensor tag\
    \ is also reported. Finally, in Section 5 the architecture of the software platform,\n\
    both for managing the fertigation system by the agronomist or system manager and\
    \ for the food\nproducts’ tracking is described; besides, the functionalities\
    \ of the developed mobile application both\nfor the farmer and customer users\
    \ are discussed.\n2. Scientiﬁc Works and Commercial Devices for Precision Farming\
    \ and Advanced\nTracking Systems\nIn this section, an overview on recent scientiﬁc\
    \ works related to DSS-based algorithms and IoT\nsolutions applied to precision\
    \ farming has been reported, together with a state of the art on advanced\ntracking\
    \ and tracing systems for monitoring agri-food products.\n2.1. A Literature Analysis\
    \ on Sensors-Based Decision Support Systems (DSS) Applied to Precision Farming\n\
    In the last decades, also agriculture is beneﬁting from the technological advances\
    \ in electronics,\ncomputers technology and communication ﬁelds [1,2]. In this\
    \ context, great relevance is ascribable\nto the DSSs, a wide range of software\
    \ tools that based on several input data related to soil and\nenvironmental parameters,\
    \ acquired by sensor nodes distributed on the cultivated land, to weather\nforecasts,\
    \ to crops’ growth status or pathogens presence, then help the farmer to make\
    \ decisions relative\nto farm activities or issues to be addressed [3].\nIn [4],\
    \ the authors described a real-time DSS, for minimizing disease eﬀects for the\
    \ tomatoes\ncultivated in a greenhouse, structured in three stages: the supervision\
    \ one detects and diagnoses any\nfailure of sensors involved in culture monitoring,\
    \ the control stage monitors the climate parameters\ninside the greenhouse and\
    \ the management one, based on pests and diseases data acquired on ﬁeld,\noptimizes\
    \ these parameters to limit the spread of pathogens harmful to crops. Furthermore,\
    \ the DSS\nintegrates a real-time rule-based tool, implemented by G2-Gensym Corporation\
    \ software and supported\nby a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\
    \ control system; this last has as inputs the\nactuated variables (windows status,\
    \ irrigation valves, heating), as outputs the controlled variables\n(interior\
    \ temperature and humidity, soil water content, nutrients, etc.), whereas the\
    \ disturbances are the\nuncontrolled variables, such as weather conditions, diseases\
    \ and pest presence. Moreover, a fuzzy-logic\ncontroller allows optimizing the\
    \ system dynamic behavior by modifying the set-point variables of the\nclimate\
    \ control unit.\nAn innovative framework for a cloud-based decision support automation\
    \ system (DSAS) in\norder to assist the orchards’ cultural practices was presented\
    \ in [5], able to acquire data from diﬀerent\nsources, to make speciﬁc decisions\
    \ and control devices installed on the ﬁeld. It has a modular software\narchitecture,\
    \ featured by decision modules arranged in a hierarchical structure, handling\
    \ the diversity\nof data by using a data model to specify the format, data types\
    \ and enabled operations of input data set.\nGiven the heterogeneity of possible\
    \ cultural operations on the orchard, the cloud-based DSAS has an\nextendible\
    \ and adaptive architecture, for adding a new decision module when required. In\
    \ particular,\nthe software follows the open/close principle, namely, it is open\
    \ for any extensions, but close for\nmodiﬁcations. The software-managed control\
    \ was structured in three layers: (1) the decision layer\ndeﬁnes the actions at\
    \ a high level, (2) the service plane schedules the actions for each device, (3)\
    \ the\ndevice layer performs the deﬁned schedules (Figure 1).\nAn IoT-based system\
    \ for smart agriculture that employs a tree-type decision algorithm was\ndescribed\
    \ in [6], using as main elements the IoT devices for acquiring information directly\
    \ on the ﬁeld,\nthe gateway and the service platform. The sensor nodes employed\
    \ the Arduino board for detecting\nparameters from connected sensors and controlling\
    \ actuators; acquired data are fused to produce a\nmore consistent and accurate\
    \ database and, employing Kalman ﬁlter, the noise derived from data\nfusion operation\
    \ was minimized. A Raspberry Pi board was used as a gateway for connecting WSN\n\
    nodes to the cloud service. The algorithm employed in the decision-making process\
    \ is the tree-type one\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n5 of 43\n(“if-then rules”) based\
    \ on decision rules and input data both stored in a my-structured query language\n\
    (MySQL) database.\nE. Han et al. proposed a DSS tool, named climate-agriculture-modelling\
    \ and decision tool\n(CAMDT) able to combine the seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs)\
    \ with the crops model, for readily\nobtaining information related to cultural\
    \ processes adjustment and water management, thus ensuring\nimprovements of crops\
    \ yield based on the climatic forecasts during the cultivation period [7].\nIn\
    \ particular, the CAMDT was supported by DSSAT (decision support system for agro-technology\n\
    transfer)-CSM (cropping system model)–Rice model for obtaining tailored information\
    \ for crops\ndecisions, both in terms of direct outcomes (such as yield and water\
    \ stress) and translated outcomes\n(such as the risk of water stress and gross\
    \ margin).\nFigure 1. (a) Decision support system (DSS) software structure reported\
    \ in [5] and (b) its three-layer\narchitecture with decision, service and device\
    \ planes, respectively.\nC.C. Baseca et al. developed a real-time smart decision\
    \ system to determine the variable rate\nirrigation parameters and variable rate\
    \ fertigation rules for optimizing the crops yield [8]; it collects\ncrops data\
    \ (soil and leaf sensors), weather forecasts, machinery data (pivot irrigation,\
    \ controller units\nand actuators, pumps status, etc.), that are sent to a middleware.\
    \ After a preprocessing phase, these data\nare processed by means of a decision-making\
    \ system obtained by combining the learning prediction\nrules with the Drools\
    \ rules management system for producing relevant results and thus allowing to\n\
    improve both farm sustainability and competitiveness.\nTorres et al. developed\
    \ a three-layer data fusion algorithm, called Hydra, for improving the\naccuracy\
    \ of employed sensors to determine some critical events more accurately, and thus\
    \ for\nmaking appropriate decisions related to the smart water management [9];\
    \ the Hydra algorithm\nemploys, at the lower level, some ﬁltering methods (extreme\
    \ Studentized method—ESD and weighted\noutlier–Robust Kalman ﬁlter—WRKF) for identifying\
    \ and removing the outliners, thus enhancing the\nalgorithm reliability.\nIn [10],\
    \ the authors presented a robust approach to simulate, by employing cultural simulation\n\
    models for a speciﬁc location and year, the crops yield potential (Yp) and to\
    \ estimate the yield gap (Yg),\ndiﬀerence between Yp and average actual farm yield\
    \ (Ya). The authors aim to provide guidelines for\nestimating yield gaps and for\
    \ simulating the climate change impact and land-use change from local to\nglobal\
    \ spatial scale.\nThe state of the art on big data applications in smart farming\
    \ is presented by authors in [11],\nexplaining how new technologies and devices,\
    \ namely IoT-oriented solutions and cloud computing,\nare inﬂuencing the entire\
    \ food supply chain, so providing predictive insights in the agricultural\nprocesses,\
    \ driving real-time operational decisions and also redesigning the farm economic\
    \ processes\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n6 of 43\ntowards new business models. In\
    \ [12], the current state of agricultural systems science is shown,\nfocusing\
    \ on capabilities and limitations of agronomic models that need to be improved;\
    \ common\nlimitations are scarcity of data for developing, evaluating and applying\
    \ farming system models and\ninadequate knowledge systems able to communicate\
    \ model results to society. New open data initiatives\nshow promising results\
    \ to tackle the data problem, but there must also be a cultural change among\n\
    agricultural researchers; the conclusion is that multiple platforms and diﬀerent\
    \ models are needed for\nfarming models’ applications for diﬀerent purposes.\n\
    About DSS tools, most of the existing ones are focused on relatively narrow issues,\
    \ for instance,\nthe application of a speciﬁc fungicide, when to apply the next\
    \ irrigation or how much fertilizer to\napply to a particular crop that will be\
    \ grown on a speciﬁc type of soil [12]. One of the problems related\nto DSS validation\
    \ is the change of climate conditions at the ﬁeld scale that can be considered\
    \ in the DSS\nonly with the implementation of predictive models capable of assessing\
    \ the response of agricultural\nsystems to the changing of the environmental conditions.\n\
    To overcome these limits, the authors in [11] investigated, by means of a DSS\
    \ agro-technology\ntransfer-cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM), (i) the spatial\
    \ variability of soybean yields across the\nfarming ﬁeld with diﬀerent soils and\
    \ inputs, (ii) how spatial variability in soil properties translates into\nmeasured\
    \ and predicted yields variability and (iii) how scaling soil properties aﬀects\
    \ model accuracy\nin predicting soybean yields for diﬀerent weather conditions\
    \ [13].\nAn example of DSS, named AGRODSS, was recently presented in [14]; implemented\
    \ as a\ncloud-based service, it enables various software products for agriculture\
    \ to facilitate decisions support\nto users, allowing, as other existing DSSs,\
    \ to improve business value through savings, avoiding\nrisks, better planning\
    \ and taking better advantage of available resources. AgroDSS is based on data\n\
    mining approaches able to extract useful information from large volumes of data\
    \ by using advanced\nalgorithms to identify trends, distributions and to ﬁnd patterns\
    \ that can be hard to see with naked eyes.\nThe newly acquired knowledge can better\
    \ help understand the data, see how data changes in time,\nand help to predict\
    \ the future impact of diﬀerent actions and farming processes. In [15] the authors\n\
    described an intelligent logistic tracking and tracing system, able to ensure\
    \ traced horticultural food\nsecurity and quality, so determining fair prices.\
    \ The traceability framework consists of four following\nphases, namely identiﬁcation,\
    \ modeling, processing and traceability data presentation, so helping\ndecision-makers\
    \ in the issue of food security, obtaining an eﬃcient product distribution and\
    \ increased\ncustomers’ satisfaction. Finally, the developed logistical approach\
    \ employs fuzzy set theory, artiﬁcial\nneural networks, sensors technology and\
    \ genetic algorithms.\n2.2. Advanced IoT-Oriented Technical Solutions for Monitoring\
    \ and Precision Agriculture\nIn this paragraph, an overview, regarding the precision\
    \ farming applications, techniques, and\nemployed Io-T oriented devices, is reported\
    \ in order to exploit the available resources in the best and\nmost eﬃcient way\
    \ and also to satisfy the needs of cultivated crops with the ultimate goal of\
    \ optimizing\ntheir quantity and quality.\nWSNs development and their growing\
    \ popularity are due not only to the usefulness for individual\nusers, but also\
    \ to the role that they can play in supporting the entire community; an interesting\
    \ example\nis the forecast service on signiﬁcant atmospheric events. In this context,\
    \ the sEmPliCE project (Eledia\ncivil protection expositor), developed by the\
    \ ELEDIA research center in Trento (Italy), aims to make\neasily accessible the\
    \ numerous data related to environmental monitoring acquired by heterogeneous\n\
    technologies present on Trento’s provincial territory. Through an intuitive software\
    \ platform accessible\nby smartphones and tablets, the interested citizens can\
    \ obtain information updated in real time and\nconsult the data history, receiving\
    \ alert notiﬁcations in case of a forecast of natural disasters.\nIn the next\
    \ future, a fundamental role will be represented by artiﬁcial vision systems able\
    \ to manage\nthe actions performed by actuator robots on the cultivated products;\
    \ concerning this topic, the research\nhas already yielded signiﬁcant results\
    \ [16]. Below are shown some examples of robots employed\nto perform diﬀerent\
    \ tasks depending on the speciﬁc application and crop typology. In Figure 2a,\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n7 of 43\nthe so-called Vitirover autonomous mower-robot\
    \ is used to eliminate herbicides being able to mow\nthe grass up to a few centimeters\
    \ from the foot of vine plants; energy autonomy is guaranteed by\nphotovoltaic\
    \ cells placed on its roof (for further detail http://www.vitirover.com/) [17].\
    \ The robot\nworks on the basis of the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates,\
    \ provided by the manufacturer,\nrelated to cultivated land limits, being able\
    \ also to avoid any holes or pits; it is controlled by Please\nverify. or smartphone\
    \ app and through it, the farmer can manage the robot by positioning it in the\n\
    ground or vineyard. In addition, the drones are employed in the agricultural sector\
    \ for monitoring\nthe crops’ growth or pests’ spread; in Figure 2b, the so-named\
    \ Falcon 8 drone is shown while it is\nﬂying over an agricultural land. The drone,\
    \ provided with eight propellers, is capable of making video\nfootage and, by\
    \ using some infrared (IR) sensors, to detect the chlorophyll amount inside the\
    \ vineyards,\na fundamental parameter for agronomists and winemakers.\nFigure\
    \ 2. Image of solar-powered Vitirover robot in action on the ground (a); Falcon\
    \ 8 drone employed\nto monitor, by means of the infrared (IR) sensors, the chlorophyll\
    \ amount inside the vineyards (b).\nIn the GRAPE (acronym of ground robot for\
    \ vineyard monitoring and protection) project [18],\nan autonomous ground robot\
    \ equipped with a robotic arm was realized to monitor plants health in the\nvineyards\
    \ and, by navigating along the rows of vines, to dispense pheromones against pests.\
    \ Many\nresearch works are focused on the possibility to use the emerging digital\
    \ technologies to improve and\naid the agricultural sector management [19]. In\
    \ addition, the signiﬁcant potential of big data analysis\napplied to smart and\
    \ precision farming is highlighted in [20]; the authors show that the availability\n\
    of hardware and software techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well\
    \ as the increasing\non-ﬁeld usage of big data sources, shall encourage more academic\
    \ research, public sector initiatives\nand business ventures in the agricultural\
    \ sector.\nFrom the hardware point of view, the most used technology to detect\
    \ diﬀerent interest quantities\nof agricultural land is that of WSNs that can\
    \ be employed to carry out several monitoring operations;\nfor instance, they\
    \ are used for environmental condition monitoring or for providing information\n\
    about soil nutrients, allowing to predict crop health and product quality over\
    \ time. A classiﬁcation\nrelated to diﬀerent study cases to thoroughly explore\
    \ the existing solutions proposed in the literature,\naccording to their design\
    \ and implementation parameters is presented in [21]. Speciﬁcally, diﬀerent\n\
    farming applications that can be implemented by using WSNs are presented in [21]\
    \ related to\nirrigation management systems, farming monitoring systems, pest\
    \ and disease control and prediction,\ncontrolled use of fertilizers, vineyards’\
    \ production monitoring, groundwater quality monitoring,\ncattle movement monitoring,\
    \ gases monitoring into a greenhouse, asset tracking, remote control\nand diagnosis.\
    \ In addition, the authors classiﬁed the possible architectures in various categories,\n\
    highlighting the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one.\n\
    WSN nodes are based on programmable microcontrollers and designed as modular structures\n\
    open both from the hardware and software point of view [22,23]. The sensors used\
    \ for detecting\ndiﬀerent environmental and soil parameters have to be carefully\
    \ chosen; concerning soil water content\nmeasure, numerous techniques are currently\
    \ in use and the suitability of each one depends on cost,\naccuracy, durability\
    \ and response time [24]. A widely used measurement technique is based on\nthe\
    \ dependence of the dielectric constant with the soil water content that signiﬁcantly\
    \ aﬀects the\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n8 of 43\npropagation of the electromagnetic\
    \ waves inside the medium; in fact, the dielectric constant of dry soil\nis much\
    \ less than a wet one. Two approaches are commonly used to measure the dielectric\
    \ constant of\nsoil, namely the time domain approach and frequency domain one;\
    \ advantages of the ﬁrst are the low\ncost, need of low-frequency circuits, no\
    \ employment hazardous radiations and a fast response time.\nInstead, the frequency\
    \ domain approach has higher sensitivity to insulation and is more sensitive to\
    \ air\ngaps. A low-cost solar-powered monitoring station equipped with an analysis\
    \ probe based on the\nfrequency domain method was developed in [25] for measuring\
    \ temperature and humidity of both air\nand high silica content clay soil at diﬀerent\
    \ depths.\nA proper WSN design represents a fundamental point for monitoring diﬀerent\
    \ parameters in an\nagricultural land; a signiﬁcant issue that has to be taken\
    \ into account regards the power consumption\nof each sensor node, for ensuring\
    \ long node autonomy. In this regard, energy harvesting techniques\nrepresent\
    \ a real opportunity, thus obtaining a technical solution nearly with no maintenance\
    \ [26–29].\nAir pollution monitoring is another ﬁeld where WSNs are employed;\
    \ the meteorological conditions,\nsuch as wind speed and atmospheric turbulence,\
    \ aﬀect air quality as reported in [30] where a WSN\nwas designed, with an eﬀective\
    \ energy-saving system for each sensor node, for air and environment\npollution\
    \ detection. In this context, in [31] the authors propose a low-cost WSN for air\
    \ monitoring\napplications; the sensor node is based on commercial gas sensors\
    \ and a low power ZigBee (zonal\nintercommunication global-standard bee) module,\
    \ which shares the acquired information with the\ncloud by means of a gateway.\
    \ The experimental results demonstrate the proper operation of the node,\nhaving\
    \ obtained a 93.03% discrimination rate and R2 coeﬃcient values, in the gas quantitative\
    \ detection,\naround 0.99. An overview of WSN applications is presented in [32]\
    \ focusing on ﬁve application\nareas, namely healthcare, agriculture, environmental,\
    \ industry and military. Moreover, the technical\nfeatures of both hardware and\
    \ software sections for WSN design are given in detail depending on the\napplication\
    \ [32]. A WSN-based smart system was developed in [33] for monitoring the availability\n\
    level and rapid changes of water content in the soil, with the aim of guaranteeing\
    \ early ﬂood prediction,\nwater savings in the farmland irrigation as well as\
    \ waste reduction and optimal use of water resources\nwhere its availability is\
    \ poor [34,35]. All aforementioned WSN solutions can be applied in the precision\n\
    agriculture ﬁeld, namely a management strategy that employs information technology\
    \ to improve\ncrops’ quality and production [35,36]. Wireless sensor technologies\
    \ and Information Technology\n(IT)-based management tools can lead to a highly\
    \ eﬀective green agriculture, including, just as an\nexample, the proper supply\
    \ of adequate nutrients to crops and appropriate use of pesticides for the\noptimized\
    \ control of weeds, pests and diseases.\nThe recent WSN applications in precision\
    \ agriculture are analyzed in [37], where the various\nwireless communication\
    \ protocols are classiﬁed and compared; besides, this work reports a study on\n\
    the taxonomy of energy-eﬃcient and harvesting techniques for WSNs used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring\nsystems and a comparison between previous research works on agriculture-ﬁeld\
    \ WSNs. In addition, the\ndeep learning, a recent modern technique for image elaboration\
    \ and data processing, was introduced\nin agriculture domain; speciﬁcally, in\
    \ [38] a survey on 40 research works employing deep learning\ntechniques in various\
    \ agricultural and food production areas was carried out; in this context, the\n\
    authors analyzed particular agricultural issues, namely the used frameworks and\
    \ models, the sources,\nnature and preprocessing of the collected data and the\
    \ overall performance achieved according to the\nmetrics employed in each under-analysis\
    \ research work.\nThe optimization of energy consumption is crucial in WSN applications\
    \ for agriculture since\nusually the nodes are distributed in remote areas where\
    \ the maintenance for changing or recharging\nthe batteries is diﬃcult. Del Valle-Soto\
    \ et al. developed a WSN energy model to estimate the energy\nconsumption of each\
    \ node during the diﬀerent operations (data acquisition and transmission), when\n\
    the routing protocol is running [39]. The model validation is performed by employing\
    \ TI CC2530-based\nboards, which run a multiparent hierarchical (MPH) routing\
    \ protocol. The experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed protocol shows\
    \ a lower energy consumption respect to ad-hoc on-demand distance\nvector (AODV),\
    \ ZigBee tree routing (ZTR) and dynamic source routing (DSR), whereas the MPH\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n9 of 43\nprotocol has a slightly greater energy consumption\
    \ compared to the energy-aware protocols such as\npower-eﬃcient gathering in sensor\
    \ information systems (PEGASIS) and low energy adaptive clustering\nhierarchy\
    \ (LEACH) (2% and 3%, respectively).\nA crops’ monitoring system based on wireless\
    \ sensor network is reported in [40]. The authors\npresent their developed system\
    \ composed of seven parts: the data processing unit (model ATmega128,\nmanufactured\
    \ by Microchip Technology, Chandler, AZ, USA) which processes all the information\n\
    and manipulates the peripherals, the CC1101 Radio Frequency (RF) module (manufactured\
    \ by Texas\nInstrument, Dallas, TX, USA) for transmitting data collected by sensors\
    \ related to environmental and\nsoil parameters, a control unit to regulate the\
    \ activation/deactivation of each employed sensor node (for\nobtaining energy\
    \ saving), a data storage unit composed of AT45DB041D serial-interface ﬂash memory\n\
    (manufactured by Adesto Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a power supply unit\
    \ (DC source or\nsolar battery), an analog interface used to adjust voltage values\
    \ provided by the employed sensors\nas required by the analog to digital converter\
    \ (ADC) and ﬁnally a digital interface for digital sensors.\nIn their system,\
    \ the authors employed also an image sensor node made up of a system-on-a-chip\
    \ (SoC)\nTHLK2405 images processing module and a CMOS model OV7640 images array\
    \ sensor (manufactured\nby OmniVision, Santa Clara, CA, USA) capable of operating\
    \ at up to 30 frames per second (fps) [20].\nIn the proposed system, the WSN is\
    \ fully integrated with an innovative fertigation unit and a farm\nmanagement\
    \ software platform implementing a DSS-algorithm supported by agronomic database;\n\
    also, the software platform allows the user, by means of a mobile application,\
    \ to control all the system\nfunctionalities and to view the stored data concerning\
    \ the carried out treatments and irrigations, as\ndescribed in Section 5.\n2.3.\
    \ Potentialities of Tracking and Tracing Software Systems and Analysis on the\
    \ Most Suitable Parameters for\nMonitoring the Freshness of Rapidly Perishable\
    \ Agricultural and Food Products\nAs known the supply chain (SC) of agriculture\
    \ products involves several processing and\nmanagement steps before the products\
    \ could reach the ﬁnal users; each step has much data associated\nwith it, often\
    \ unknown to the end customer. However, these data could be crucial both for companies,\n\
    in order to create logistic strategies and marketing techniques, but also for\
    \ the end costumers to ensure\nfood security and quality. For these reasons, exploiting\
    \ the IoT advances, diﬀerent smart tracing and\ntracking systems have been developed.\
    \ The agri-food industry is one of the most promising candidates\nwhich could\
    \ beneﬁt from all the features introduced by these technologies. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ intelligent\npackaging (IP), radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), WSNs, analytics\
    \ and cloud platforms have been\npervasively applied to tracing and tracking systems,\
    \ allowing to improve the tracing capabilities along\nthe whole SC, while ensuring\
    \ the availability and accuracy of products data. Furthermore, the system\nscalability\
    \ is allowed by employing analytical methods and big data techniques, making the\
    \ work of\noperators easier and more eﬃcient [41].\nRelatively to the food chain,\
    \ almost a third of produced food for human consumption\nworldwide—approximately\
    \ 1.3 billion tons every year—is wasted. In industrialized countries, more\nthan\
    \ 40% of losses happen at the retail and consumer levels. Food is sometimes thrown\
    \ away ‘just\nin case’ when it is still ﬁne to be consumed. Diﬀerent solutions\
    \ have been developed to monitor\nthe quality of the packaged food and stored\
    \ before being consumed, ranging from color changing\nlabels as a function of\
    \ food container temperature to RFID tags that link up with smartphones to give\n\
    detailed information on the food status and sensors that indicate how ripe fruit\
    \ is [42]. Poor chill chain\nmanagement within the food supply chain and some\
    \ uncertainty about how long ago food packs\nwere opened after purchase are crucial\
    \ aspects that can determine the failure of stored food products;\ndiﬀerent companies\
    \ have developed smart tags that help retailers and the restaurant industry for\n\
    addressing this issue.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n10 of 43\nIn the ﬁeld of tracking\
    \ and tracing of food products, an interesting commercial application is the\n\
    TT Sensor PlusTM, which combines a low-power temperature sensor and data logging\
    \ functionality\nin an adhesive label [43] (Figure 3a); it can be applied to the\
    \ container for monitoring the product\ntemperature, making the latter available\
    \ to the user through near-ﬁeld communication (NFC) by using\na mobile application\
    \ (Figure 3b). In addition, the evolution of this product, called TT Sensor PlusTM\
    \ 2,\nis equipped with two light emitting diodes (LEDs) for indicating the label\
    \ status (active/inactive) or\nalert conditions [44]. The device is fed by a 3\
    \ V lithium battery, so guaranteeing a long autonomy (more\nthan 3 years after\
    \ the activation). Such devices are suitable for several applications, as monitoring\
    \ of\npharmaceutical and medical products (Figure 3c), food and beverage, chemicals\
    \ and polymer-based\ngoods and in general other products sensitive to the storing\
    \ temperature.\nFigure 3. (a) Structure of the TT Sensor PlusTM smart label (b)\
    \ to monitor the temperature of food\nproducts made available through NFC by using\
    \ the mobile app; (c) TT Sensor PlusTM 2 label applied to\na bottle of wine (left)\
    \ or a pack of drugs [43,44].\nIn [45], the authors proposed a multilayer and\
    \ technological framework to support the company\nactivities in the development\
    \ of a traceability system based on Industry 4.0 principles. At ﬁrst,\nthe proposed\
    \ framework, given the adopted business model, identiﬁes and models the process\n\
    inﬂuencing the product. In addition, the identiﬁcation of each productive process\
    \ step and entity\nwhich stores the products information along the SC is required.\
    \ These operations are enabled by the\nIoT technologies [46,47]. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the information related to the production environment, to the\nproduct transformation\
    \ or to the transport conditions are acquired and monitored by sensors placed\n\
    along the whole SC. Moreover, an IT application is employed for collecting these\
    \ data and making\nthem accessible by the company as well as the end-users, to\
    \ guarantee the beneﬁts above described.\nQi et al. illustrated a WSN-based integrated\
    \ cold chain shelf life decision support (C2SLDS) system,\ndesigned for perishable\
    \ food products cold-chain management [48]. The developed architecture relies\n\
    on a WSN for acquiring and transmitting, in a distributed manner, the products’\
    \ parameters, while a\ntime–temperature indicator (TTI) monitors and records the\
    \ time–temperature history of the products\nalong the whole SC. The system consists\
    \ of a 3-layer architecture, named WTTI (WSN-based TTI),\nAGS (advanced RISC machine\
    \ (ARM)-based gateway system) and LDSS (least shelf life ﬁrst out\n(LSFO) decision\
    \ support system), respectively. The WTTI is a reduced-function device, able to\
    \ acquire\ntemperature and wirelessly transmit shelf life information to a ZigBee\
    \ coordinator. The AGS consists\nof a Zigbee coordinator node and an ARM-based\
    \ smart device that gathers the temperature data from\nthe coordinator node. The\
    \ LDSS decisions are driven by the application server, the data warehouse\nserver,\
    \ the model base, the knowledge base, the routers and the ﬁrewalls. Based on this\
    \ information,\na software application calculates the shelf life of the products\
    \ by means of the TTI, once known the\nshelf life prediction model and the parameters\
    \ in the knowledge base.\nThe afore reported works propose devices able to monitor,\
    \ each, only one physical or chemical\nquantity, so indicating the freshness of\
    \ the speciﬁc stored product; instead, the designed BLE smart tag\nis able to\
    \ simultaneously detect several physical and chemical quantities, so covering\
    \ a wide range of\napplications, for monitoring the storage conditions of diﬀerent\
    \ food typologies.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n11 of 43\nIn [49], the author proposed\
    \ a traceability system applicable to the agri-food products supply chain.\nThis\
    \ system employs RFID technology for enabling the data acquisition, the traceability\
    \ during the\ndiﬀerent productive steps (production, warehousing, distribution)\
    \ as well as the sale links of agri-food\nproducts. In addition, the system employs\
    \ several blockchain technologies to ensure the authenticity\nand reliability\
    \ of the shared information. Another approach to traceability of vegetables based\
    \ on\nRFID technology was described in [50]; speciﬁcally, a uniﬁed modeling language\
    \ (UML) is deﬁned to\nsupport the product traceability and, thus, creating a method\
    \ for modeling the products information\n(harvesting place, performed treatments,\
    \ places of storage, etc.) and quality. Such traceability code\nwas formatted\
    \ according to the European article number (EAN) and uniform code council (UCC)\n\
    standards. This UML modeling is used to perform real time tracking of the product,\
    \ thus allowing it to\neasily improve its quality as well as reducing the waste.\n\
    Ampatzidis et al. proposed two solutions to bind the bins employed to harvest\
    \ the fruits with the\ncorresponding pairs of trees, thus establishing the harvesting\
    \ yield of an orchard [51]. The ﬁrst method\nrelies on passive RFID tags, operating\
    \ in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band (866 MHz for Europe),\nplaced on the\
    \ bins (Figure 4) and a long-range RFID radar-reader (manufactured by Trolley\
    \ Scan\nCompanyTM, Johannesburg, South Africa) and a diﬀerential GPS (DGPS) receiver\
    \ (model AgGPS® 106,\nmanufactured by Trible Geospatial, Vimercate, Italy), located\
    \ at the back of the collecting tractor, 1.50\nm above the ground; in the second\
    \ one, only the RFID tags are used, which are placed onto each pair\nof trees\
    \ as well as bins.\nIn addition to the implementation of a traceability system,\
    \ the low-cost BLE tag, designed and\ntested in this research work as reported\
    \ in the following sections, allows the detection of several\nfreshness indexes\
    \ for monitoring storage and transport conditions, making them available to the\
    \ user\nby a proper mobile application.\nFigure 4. Representation of bins collection\
    \ by the tractor equipped with a radio frequency identiﬁcation\n(RFID) reader\
    \ and diﬀerential GPS (DGPS) receiver.\nIn [52] two examples of the integration\
    \ between RFID technology and WSNs to trace any step of\nthe SC of the wine production\
    \ from the vineyard to the ﬁnal consumer are proposed. This allowed\ndemonstrating\
    \ how the constantly growing need to know more about the food we eat can be satisﬁed,\n\
    successfully monitoring and storing for traceability purposes, all the valuable\
    \ information of the whole\nSC. In [53] a similar approach is generalized to demonstrate\
    \ its applicability to diﬀerent types of food\nindustries. It has been shown how\
    \ the integration between WSNs and passive RFID technology could\nenable traceability\
    \ improvements for the ﬁnal customer as well as for the company, maintaining a\n\
    constant information line along the production and distribution chain, taking\
    \ care of some critical\nparameters like events in development, production parameters\
    \ (for example temperature, humidity,\netc.), limited storage life, storage and\
    \ transport conditions„ etc. All these improvements guarantee a\nmedium-term return\
    \ of investment for the company as well as a value-adding for the customer.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n12 of 43\nOn the other side, an approach to enhance RFID\
    \ technology, with the aim to use it for traceability\nand parameter monitoring,\
    \ is to integrate sensing capability directly on the tag. The design and actual\n\
    use of chemical or biologic sensors as well as indicator labels in smart and active\
    \ packaging, in order\nto monitor the degree of freshness or correct conservation\
    \ of food, is a growing ﬁeld of study, thus\nobtaining at the same time a real-time\
    \ food-status monitoring, a reduction of food waste, an extension\nof shelf life\
    \ and improvement of overall food quality [54]. For example, in [55] the possibility\
    \ to exploit\nsome new chemical interactive materials (CIM) to realize battery-less\
    \ RFID sensor tags, capable to\ndetect diﬀerent gas species or humidity, is explored.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, considering applications to prevent\nfood-wasting, the use of the\
    \ doped poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PSS) as CIM to detect ethanol should be\nevaluated\
    \ because it is one of the indicators of food perishing. Other chemical and physical\
    \ parameters\ncan be monitored, and consequently diﬀerent types of sensors can\
    \ be used, to determine if food is\ngoing to decay. More in detail, in [56] a\
    \ review of the most widespread chemical and biologic sensors\nfor detecting food\
    \ quality is presented. Diﬀerent sensors work properly by monitoring diﬀerent\n\
    indicators for speciﬁc types of food, in order to control freshness markers or\
    \ detect the presence\nof allergens, pathogens, adulterants and toxicants. For\
    \ example, in ﬁsh products, one of the main\nfreshness indicators is the hypoxanthine,\
    \ which is produced by the metabolic degradation of adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP),\
    \ whereas an indicator of the stored grain spoilage is the emission of CO2 as\
    \ result\nof insects’ infestations. The stored cereals are also often threatened\
    \ by mildews and fungi, which can\nbe discovered by speciﬁc biosensors for mycotoxin\
    \ detection; instead, concerning fruits and vegetables,\nvolatile organic compounds\
    \ (VOC) accumulate when they are closed into containers or packages.\nThe temperature\
    \ and humidity can also be useful for monitoring food spoilage, not to mention\n\
    that temperature is a key–value when it is needed to maintain the cold chain.\
    \ In this regard, some of\nthe authors have already presented in [57] a UHF RFID\
    \ sensor tag suitable for cold chain applications.\nSpeciﬁcally, the device is\
    \ a semi-passive tag that includes an antenna matched with the EM4325 RFID\nchip\
    \ impedance, a micro-controller unit (MCU), LEDs and general purpose input output\
    \ (GPIO) ports,\nto provide both tracking and temperature monitoring of fresh\
    \ and frozen ﬁsh. The device was thought\nof like a reusable board attached to\
    \ the storage box. The tracked data are collected by the system\neach time the\
    \ electronic product code (EPC) is read, but if a temperature threshold value\
    \ is overcome\nfor a speciﬁc time interval, a LED on the board is also lighted\
    \ up providing a visual alert for the\nhuman operator.\nAnother example of RFID\
    \ technology applied to food tracking and monitoring industries is\nproposed in\
    \ [58], where a printed NFC sensor tag was realized, capable to detect the trimethylamine\n\
    (TMA), another indicator of the ﬁsh and meat spoilage. The authors performed a\
    \ practical test by\nsuccessfully measuring the sensor response to the aging of\
    \ a codﬁsh ﬁlet, monitoring the changes in\nthe sensor response from 2 days before\
    \ to 3 days after the expiring date. A similar proof of concept has\nbeen provided\
    \ in [59], where a smart RFID tag for monitoring the meat decay is described.\
    \ As the\nﬁrst step, the authors combined diﬀerent sensors to map the ammonia\
    \ values when temperature and\nhumidity conditions of the pork meat sample varied.\
    \ This procedure allowed to discover 4 levels of\nammonia concentration for accurately\
    \ indicating the freshness of under-test food; then the prototype\nboard, integrating\
    \ the UHF RFID tag, MCU and the ammonia sensor has been developed.\nChemical and\
    \ physical indicators are not the only ones that can give information about the\
    \ good\nconservation of food [60]. Food color is also a good quality marker, especially\
    \ for food industries where\nthe product appearance is as important as its taste.\
    \ An interesting example of sensor tag integrating\na spectral ﬁngerprint sensor\
    \ capable to detect not only red–green–blue (RGB) frequencies, but also\ninfrared\
    \ and ultra violet (UV) light is shown in [61]. The authors realized an FR4 printed\
    \ circuit board\n(PCB) with all components of the sensor tag such as the UHF dipole\
    \ antenna, RFID chip, RGB sensor,\nIR sensor, UV sensor and the MCU. Its possible\
    \ application is in the food industry for the detection of\nthe diﬀerent food\
    \ colors, indicating variations in food quality, for example, the darker part\
    \ of a fruit\nthat is going to perish.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n13 of 43\nIn [62],\
    \ the authors presented diﬀerent tools and devices (namely sensors, indicators,\
    \ barcodes\nand RFID devices) used in the foodstuﬀs’ intelligent packaging and\
    \ explained their role and features\nfor maintaining the quality of diﬀerent food\
    \ items in terms of both low microbial growth and gas\nconcentration and for providing\
    \ convenience and easiness to users. The review study also discussed\nother packaging\
    \ technical solutions in the supply chain management of food products to control\
    \ theft\nand counterfeiting conducts and to improve the company position on the\
    \ market in terms of branding\nand marketing. As known, sensor tags require an\
    \ anti-collision protocol to avoid collisions with other\ntags present in the\
    \ same area, as happens, for instance, in a warehouse containing numerous tagged\n\
    products; for this reason, in [63] the authors propose a new anti-collision protocol\
    \ based on fuzzy\nframe slotted aloha (FFSA) architecture and a novel dynamic\
    \ frame slotted aloha (DFSA) policy. The\nreported results obtained by performed\
    \ simulations demonstrate a reduction of the reading time in\nconditions of a\
    \ high density of sensor tags.\nMost of the devices above described are disposable,\
    \ ending their life once the tagged product is\ndelivered to the food shop or\
    \ wholesaler; instead, the realized BLE tag is reusable for a large number\nof\
    \ times by picking up the empty containers to be reused by the agricultural producer,\
    \ as described in\ndetail in Section 3.3, thus allowing to amortize the tag cost\
    \ over a long time.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. Design, Functionalities and\
    \ Operating Modes of Automated Fertigation Facility Integrated with the WSN\n\
    In this paragraph, the functionalities and operating modes of designed solar-powered\
    \ farm\nmanagement facility are described, useful for farmers to monitor and control\
    \ their productions,\nto command or simply control the cultivation processes performed\
    \ on crops, such as fertigation\ncycles or disinfestation by pathogens and able\
    \ to allow the farmer or consumer to trace the cultivated\nproducts in all the\
    \ phases following the harvest. The fertigation section represents only a component\n\
    of the whole multi–functional system, fully integrated with the farm management\
    \ software platform\nthat implements a DSS algorithm for controlling all growth\
    \ phases of the cultivated products from\nplanting to harvest. The great beneﬁt\
    \ of the proposed farm facility is also the integration with a custom\ntraceability\
    \ system, for monitoring the storing and transportation conditions of the food\
    \ products\nstarting from their collection.\nIn Figure 5a, the solar-powered wooden\
    \ cottage with the automated fertigation system inside is\nshown; the hydraulic\
    \ mechanical section includes up to 5 containers with inside diﬀerent powdered\n\
    fertilizers, each provided of dosing mechanism, based on a properly sized cochlea,\
    \ for precisely\ncalibrating the amount of fertilizer to be added to the aqueous\
    \ solution (Figure 5b). In this way, the\ndesired amount of fertilizer is added\
    \ to the water in the tank; after, a mechanical mixer actuated by\nan electric\
    \ motor is used for mixing the fertilizing solution. Following, this last is pumped\
    \ by an\nelectric pump towards the diﬀerent land sections that require the fertigation\
    \ process. The composition\nof fertilizing solution is determined based on agronomic\
    \ model speciﬁc for the considered crop;\nthis model has as inputs the weather\
    \ forecasts and especially soil and environmental data detected\ndirectly on-ﬁeld\
    \ by means of the designed WSN. In fact, each WSN node constantly monitors soil\n\
    and crops’ parameters related to a speciﬁc section of the cultivated land and\
    \ wirelessly transmits\nthe detected data, through its coordinator node, towards\
    \ the cloud software platform (as shown in\nthe real implementation of Figure\
    \ 6). This last elaborates received data for determining the correct\nnutritional\
    \ and water requirements of the plants belonging to the considered section, as\
    \ a function\nof crop typology and growth phase according to the dynamic agronomic\
    \ database included in the\ncloud platform. The mathematical forecasting models,\
    \ included into the developed software system,\ncan forecast, depending on the\
    \ set treatments and crops growth status, some advance in time or\ndelay relative\
    \ to the crops’ harvests; the user farmer can activate this functionality according\
    \ to the\npurchase orders, received on the farm web portal by consumers and therefore\
    \ based on the scheduling\nof deliveries of the agri-food products to be made.\n\

    \ into two sectors with area of one\nhectare each.\nAs shown in Figure 7, the\
    \ main section of the developed remotely controlled farming facility was\nthe\
    \ “hardware control unit” which includes both mechanical and hydraulic sections\
    \ controlled by the\nelectronic unit, thereby allowing to obtain optimized fertigation\
    \ cycles in each section of the cultivated\nland, according to the crops’ needs\
    \ deﬁned by sensors data of the speciﬁc WSN cluster on the basis\nof agronomic\
    \ models and weather forecasts. The “hardware control unit” was fully powered\
    \ by a\nphotovoltaic plant consisting of three poly-crystalline 200-W solar panels\
    \ placed on the wooden cottage\nroof, a charge regulator (model Giaride 20A solar\
    \ charge controller, manufactured by Giaride, Inc.,\nHochdorf, Switzerland), the\
    \ DC/AC converter (model EDECOA 3000 W, manufactured by EDECOA,\nInc., Shenzhen,\
    \ China) and accumulation battery (model LAGM-160, manufactured by Leoch, Inc.,\n\
    Shenzhen, China) for storing the produced energy; in addition, a control and protection\
    \ panel was\nproperly sized for protecting the implant against voltage overloads\
    \ and short-circuits. The designed\n“control unit” collects information from weather\
    \ service and on-ﬁeld WSN related to the environmental\nand soil parameters and\
    \ compares them with proper thresholds derived from the agronomic models,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 3632\n15 of 43\nthereby deﬁning the fertilizing solution composition\
    \ for each cultivated crop typology. Hence, this\nunit properly drives the actuators,\
    \ belonging to mechanical and hydraulic sections, for obtaining the\nestimated\
    \ fertilizing solution and distributing it to desired sections. Another section\
    \ of the developed\nfarming facility is the cloud software platform containing\
    \ the general agronomic database, related to\nthe cultivated crops and derived\
    \ from the agronomic models that determines the threshold values\nused by the\
    \ fertigator during its operation.\nFigure 7. Functional scheme of developed fertigation\
    \ system with the diﬀerent hardware and software\nsections and related data-ﬂow\
    \ between them; the collected data on the land are processed by the control\n\
    unit and then shared with the remote general agronomic database in order to be\
    \ combined with the\nagronomic and sustainability models as well as weather conditions\
    \ or forecast.\nThe fertigation system operations are determined, also, depending\
    \ on the data directly gathered\non-ﬁeld by means of the developed WSN; this last\
    \ is constituted by several sensor nodes, with diﬀerent\nfunctions, located in\
    \ diﬀerent points of the cultivated ﬁeld or greenhouse, for detecting environmental\n\
    and soil parameters as well as data on crops growth. Each sensor node is fed through\
    \ a photovoltaic\nsystem constituted by a small amorphous silicon solar panel,\
    \ the LTC3105 DC–DC voltage regulator\n(manufactured by Linear Technology, Norwood,\
    \ MA, USA) to recharge super-capacitor or lithium\nbattery properly dimensioned\
    \ for getting long energy autonomy.\nThe WSN is arranged according to a tree structure,\
    \ including nodes equipped with sensors for\nacquiring soil and environmental\
    \ data and coordinator nodes (or middleware nodes) that collect the\ndata from\
    \ sensor nodes and transmit them towards the central unit of the fertigation system.\n\
    Referring to the agricultural land shown in Figure 6 employed for the cultivation\
    \ of a vineyard\nwith a total area of just over two hectares, the realized WSN\
    \ was tested by placing a sensor node every\n500 m2 (i.e., 20 nodes distributed\
    \ for each one-hectare sector, as depicted in Figure 6), all connected,\nthrough\
    \ the coordinator nodes, to a single control unit, that manages the fertigation\
    \ processes. In this\nway, two neighboring nodes were spaced up to a maximum value\
    \ of 25–30 m; such distance was chosen\non the basis of some communication tests\
    \ performed also on similar cultivated ﬁelds with plants or\ncrops having a maximum\
    \ height of 70–80 cm and thin stem, in order to guarantee a low packet loss\n\
    percentage (<2%). However, the number of sensor nodes has to be chosen according\
    \ to farmer needs,\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n16 of 43\n(e.g., if more crop typologies\
    \ are placed inside the same sector), taking into account that the NodeMCU\nboard\
    \ ensures a communication range up to 70–80 m in open-ﬁeld condition or up to\
    \ 45–50 m in\npresence of small plants (as above speciﬁed). On the other hand,\
    \ the realized WSN was tested inside an\norchard (in particular cherry trees with\
    \ 3 m average height), at the beginning keeping the same distance\nbetween the\
    \ nodes (30 m), so obtaining a consequent increase of the packet loss percentage\
    \ (≈20%)\nmainly due to the path loss caused by the obstacles; in this scenario,\
    \ the distance between the nodes\nhas to be reduced up to 20 m, for reducing the\
    \ packets loss percentage to a reasonable value (<2%).\nAs mentioned above, in\
    \ Figure 6 the distribution of sensor and coordinator nodes in a vineyard in\n\
    the south of Italy (speciﬁcally north of the Lecce city) is shown, to detect soil\
    \ and air parameters and\ncarry out the communication tests. The land is divided\
    \ into two one-hectare sectors with twenty nodes\nfor each one. Five sensor nodes\
    \ (of the overall 20 nodes for each hectare) are conﬁgured to act also as\ncoordinator\
    \ nodes (or middleware nodes), gathering the data packets provided by the nearby\
    \ sensor\nnodes and periodically retransmitting the data, arranged into a multidimensional\
    \ matrix, to another\ncoordinator node closer to the central unit placed on the\
    \ underside of the land, until reaching the latter\nas following detailed.\nHowever,\
    \ to optimize the WSN topology and reduce its cost, the number of coordinator\
    \ nodes can\nbe reduced; consequently, longer distance between them and the central\
    \ unit has to be covered. In this\ncase, a coordinator node equipped with an external\
    \ antenna is required; thus, as an alternative to the\nNodeMCU board, a WEMOS\
    \ D1 mini board (manufactured by Shenzhen RobotLinking Technology\nCo., Shenzhen,\
    \ China) equipped with a +5 dBi antenna was tested in these conditions allowing\
    \ a\nhigher communication range. Regarding the WSN implementation as shown in\
    \ Figure 6 for its on-ﬁeld\ntesting, since the average distance between the diﬀerent\
    \ nodes is less than 45–50 m (namely about\n30 m) without the presence of large\
    \ obstacles, both sensor and coordinator nodes were realized by\nemploying the\
    \ ESP8266 NodeMCU board.\nIn addition, the central unit implements a mechanism\
    \ for detecting malfunctions or connection\nproblems of each sensor node; in fact,\
    \ if for ﬁve consecutive observation intervals (namely after two\nand half hours),\
    \ a given sensor node doesn’t transmit the sensors data, an alert message is sent\
    \ to the\ncloud platform, which warns the operator to check the node conditions.\n\
    All the functionalities of the developed IoT-oriented farm management facility\
    \ are governed by a\nsuitable software platform, enabling the farmer or agronomist\
    \ automatic management of the fertigation\nof controlled crops, the remote actuation\
    \ and monitoring of the speciﬁc agricultural treatments, but\nalso the purchase\
    \ of agri-food products by the consumers, as discussed in Section 5.\n3.2. Sensor\
    \ Node Architecture and Related Operating Modalities\nCommunication networks have\
    \ evolved towards the IoT sector; currently, the most widely used\ntechnologies\
    \ are SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Zigbee and Wi-Fi. Depending on the application, one must\n\
    consider their performance metrics to choose one technology over another. For\
    \ example, if technology\nmaturity is the metric, Lora can be considered in a\
    \ low state, Zigbee in a medium state and Wi-Fi\nin a very high state. Instead,\
    \ if the availability is the metric, then Lora and Zigbee exhibit a low\nlevel\
    \ while Wi-Fi a high level [64]. Speciﬁcally, in WSNs applications in precision\
    \ agriculture, Wi-Fi\ntechnology is an excellent option, even more so if the Wi-Fi\
    \ connection is established by employing\nthe low-cost ESP8266 module that has\
    \ an integrated chip with Wi-Fi connection and supports the\ntransmission control\
    \ protocol (TCP)/IP protocol. The main objective is to provide any ESP8266-based\n\
    node with access to the Wi-Fi network and act as an acquisition, processing and\
    \ Wi-Fi communication\nboard. In addition, in order to oﬀset the energy expenditure\
    \ of Wi-Fi technology, this module has a\nlow-consumption architecture that allows\
    \ itself to work in 3 diﬀerent modes: active mode, sleep mode\nand deep sleep\
    \ mode, as detailed and implemented in the following sections.\nSensors 2020,\

    \ with several sensors for acquiring\nsoil and environmental parameters, wirelessly\

    \ be immediately shared on the cloud software platform. Both node typologies are\
    \ based on the\nESP8266 NodeMCU electronic board that includes ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip;\

    \ includes a\npower management unit (PMU) supporting diﬀerent sleep modalities,\
    \ which have allowed us to\nminimize the node power consumption. Speciﬁcally,\

    \ to 9 days of\nenergy autonomy (without any availability of solar energy, surely\
    \ an extreme unrealistic eventuality).\nParticularly, the used amorphous-silicon\
    \ waterproof solar panel (manufactured by Dongguan City\nXinliangguang New Energy\
    \ Technology Co., Guangdong, China, Figure 8f) is featured by a 1.5-W\nmaximum\
    \ deliverable power, 2.0-V open-circuit voltage, 1200-mA short-circuit current\
    \ and about\n10% conversion eﬃciency. A DC-DC regulation circuit (breakout board\
    \ designed by Crispytronics,\nSan Diego, CA, USA) based on the LTC3105 step-up\
    \ converter (manufactured by Linear Technology,\nNorwood, MA, USA) was used to\
    \ interface the solar panel with the storage device (Figure 8g); this\nlast has\
    \ represented either by a 90-F super-capacitor (model Vishay HVC 90 F/5.6 V, manufactured\
    \ by\nMalvern, PA, USA) or a rechargeable 100-mAh LiPo battery (model Go Wireless®\
    \ 100-mAh LFT401430,\nBeaverton, OR, USA).\nIn order to reduce the sensor node\
    \ power consumption, some structural modiﬁcations were\nperformed on the ESP8266\
    \ NodeMCU board (manufactured by Espressif Systems, Shanghai, China);\nparticularly,\
    \ the main one concerns the replacement of the proprietary ESP8266 NodeMCU voltage\n\
    regulator (model AMS1117-3.3, manufactured by Advanced Monolithic Systems, Livermore,\
    \ CA, USA)\nwith the MCP1825S-3302E model (manufactured by Microchip Technology,\
    \ Chandler, AZ, USA, see\nFigure 8a) featured by a lower quiescent current (typical\
    \ value IQ = 120 µA) and dropout voltage (typical\nvalue ∆V = 210 mV for ILOAD\
    \ = 500 mA), respect to the same quantities of the initial one (IQ = 5mA\nand\
    \ ∆V = 1.1 V for ILOAD = 800 mA). Thereby a signiﬁcant saving in sensor node power\
    \ consumption\nwas obtained during the deep sleep mode in which the voltage regulator\
    \ current consumption is the\nmain contribution.\nMoreover, because the most energetically\
    \ expensive phase is the transmission one between sensor\nnodes, to extend node\
    \ autonomy, WSN operation was properly optimized according to the ﬂowchart\nof\
    \ Figure 9, that describes the operating modalities of both sensor and coordinator\
    \ nodes. Each sensor\nnode acquires the soil and environmental parameters from\
    \ sensors and sends them to the relative\ncoordinator node; at the transmission\
    \ end, the sensor node enters in deep sleep mode for 30 min (time\ninterval settable\
    \ by user) for reducing its power consumption. If the connection with the coordinator\n\
    node fails, the sensor node retries this operation every 1 min until the connection\
    \ is obtained. During\nthe connection phase, sensor nodes belonging to a given\
    \ sector send acquired data to the corresponding\ncoordinator node; every 30 min\
    \ this last arranges collected data into a single packet and transmits it to\n\
    the electronic control unit to be sent, via an Internet connection, to the cloud\
    \ software platform, and\nthen returns in the receiving mode.\nThe proposed farming\
    \ facility is constituted by low-cost solutions, but reliable at the same time,\n\
    in all its sections compared to other competitor systems. The cost of the fertigator\
    \ and WSN nodes\nis a function of the land size; for instance, supposing a two-hectare\
    \ ﬁeld, the cost of the fertigator\nis about 2900–3200 €, including mechanical,\
    \ electronic and hydraulic sections. For the WSN, the\ncost of each sensor node\
    \ is about 35 €, signiﬁcantly lower compared to similar solutions present on\n\
    the market. Considering a two-hectare ﬁeld (as described in Figure 6), divided\
    \ into two sectors of\nabout one hectare each and placing a node every 500 m2\
    \ (extendable up to 2000 m2, but with rougher\nmonitoring), 40 nodes (reducible\
    \ up to 10) are required for covering the whole land; therefore, the cost\nof\
    \ the WSN is about 1400 € (350 € for the solution with fewer nodes in any case\
    \ suﬃcient to ensure a\nproper communication).\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n19 of\

    \ BLE Sensor Tag for Monitoring the Product Conditions and\nSupporting Traceability\n\
    A BLE sensor tag was developed for monitoring the correct storage conditions of\
    \ the agri-food\nproducts during the storing or transportation, in order to assess\
    \ its freshness and integrity, but\nalso to support the product traceability.\
    \ The parameters selected for verifying the good storage\nconditions are the concentration\
    \ of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), NH3 (ammonia) and\nCO2, the environmental\
    \ temperature and humidity [60]. The TVOCs concentration summarizes\ncontributions\
    \ from some common gaseous species produced during the deterioration of food,\
    \ such as\nCH3CH2OH (ethanol), C2H4 (ethylene), CS2 (carbon disulﬁde), etc. [54,56].\n\
    Also, the NH3 represents a good indicator of protein decomposition, thus its concentration\
    \ can\nbe used to determine meat freshness [65]. Instead, the CO2 monitoring can\
    \ be used to control the\nquality of stored cereal and detect their spoilage.\
    \ In particular, CO2 concentrations between 600 and\n1.500 ppm indicate the onset\
    \ of mold growth due to excessive moisture inside the stored material\nor moisture\
    \ inﬁltration into the structure; instead, concentrations higher than 1500 ppm\
    \ indicate a\nserious mold growth aﬀecting the whole material or an infestation\
    \ of insects inside the stored food [66].\nThe developed BLE smart tag, oﬀering\
    \ a multiparameter detection, is featured by great versatility, so\nallowing its\
    \ application to diﬀerent food typologies (e.g., vegetables, fruits, meat, ﬁsh,\
    \ etc.), unlike\nother devices reported in the literature or present on the market\
    \ which are tailored for a speciﬁc\nproduct typology.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n\
    20 of 43\nThe designed sensor tag uses the HM-10 BLE module (manufactured by Jinan\
    \ Huamao Technology\nco, Jinan City, China) based on CC2541 Integrated Circuit\
    \ (IC) (manufactured by Texas Instrument,\nDallas, TX, USA), a system-on-chip\
    \ (SoC) combining a 2.4 GHz BLE transceiver, compliant to Bluetooth\nv4.0 protocol\
    \ stack, with an 8051 MCU, featured by 128 KB ﬂash memory, 8 KB RAM and several\n\
    supporting features and peripherals (i.e., 12-bit ADC, 23 General-Purpose I/O\
    \ Pins, Watchdog Timer).\nThe wide range of peripherals and the integrated BLE\
    \ transceiver, implementing the v4.1 BLE\nstack, along with the advanced PMU are\
    \ the main reasons that justify the choice of CC2541 IC for the\nimplementation\
    \ of the BLE smart tag. It has three distinct low-power modalities (i.e., PMi,\
    \ i = 1,2,3) with\nincreasingly lower current consumption, making it ideal for\
    \ portable devices, wearable applications\nand consumer electronics. The CC2541\
    \ was programmed using CC debugger and programmer,\nemploying IAR Workbench for\
    \ 8051 MCU.\nThe HM-10 module was set as iBeacon for supporting the product traceability\
    \ in the whole supply\nchain; during the sleep period of the BLE tag, an advertising\
    \ time interval of 546.25 ms was set for\nthe iBeacon modality and the broadcasted\
    \ packet universally unique identiﬁer (UUID), major, minor,\nTx power) was used\
    \ to identify the food container where the BLE sensor tag was applied. Obviously,\n\
    this tracking system aims to trace the agglomerations of food products with medium-large\
    \ dimensions\n(pallets, bins, boxes, etc.) and not for consumer-level tracking.\
    \ The BLE tag can be reused a large\nnumber of times, once the container is collected\
    \ empty from the food shop or wholesaler by the farm.\nIn addition, the tag is\
    \ applied to the inner surface by two screws, thus it can be easily removed and\n\
    applied to another container, in case of damage of the latter. For the intended\
    \ use, since the BLE smart\ntag can be reused several times, the economic impact\
    \ related to the purchase of the device is greatly\nreduced. Further details about\
    \ the operation of the developed tracking system are reported in the\nfollowing\
    \ Section 5.\nThe sensor tag is equipped with a CCS811 digital gas sensor (manufactured\
    \ by AMS, Premstetten,\nAustria), an ultra-low-power metal oxide (MOX) gas sensor\
    \ able to detect the TVOCs and equivalent\nCO2 (eCO2) concentrations for air quality\
    \ monitoring applications. The measurements are obtained\nby means of intelligent\
    \ algorithms able to process raw data related to current and voltage values\n\
    provided by the MOX sensor and acquired by an integrated ADC, to then be made\
    \ available to a\nhost MCU using the I2C interface. Furthermore, the sensor has\
    \ 3 low-power modes optimized for\nextending the autonomy in portable applications.\
    \ The wide detection range (0 ÷ 1187 ppb for TVOC\nand 400 ÷ 8192 ppm for CO2),\
    \ the high sensitivity, and the low power consumption make the CCS811\nsensor\
    \ ideal for the considered application, given also its high robustness to the\
    \ external agents\n(high humidity and temperature, as well as presence of dust).\
    \ The CCS811-based breakout board\n(manufactured by Adafruit Ind., New York, NY,\
    \ USA, Figure 10a) was employed, modiﬁed to reduce\nthe power consumption with\
    \ the removal of the built-in 3.3 V voltage regulator (model MIC5225-3.3,\nmanufactured\
    \ by Microchip Technology, Chandler, AZ, USA), since the sensor was fed directly\
    \ by the\n3.3 V voltage regulator (model XC6206-3.3 with a lower quiescent current\
    \ of only 25 µA in idle mode,\nmanufactured by Torex Semiconductor, Tokyo, Japan)\
    \ included in the power supply section of the BLE\ntag (Figure 11).\nIn addition,\
    \ the sensor tag includes a BMP280 digital temperature and humidity sensor\n(manufactured\
    \ by Bosch Sensortec, Reutlingen, Germany), featured by 300–1100 hPa pressure\
    \ range\nand −40–+85 ◦C temperature range; it is based on a piezo-resistive pressure\
    \ sensor combined with\nan integrated mixed-signal conditioning and acquisition\
    \ section, then providing the conversion\nresults through a digital interface\
    \ (serial peripheral interface—SPI or inter-integrated circuit—I2C)\n(Figure 10b).\
    \ The small dimension and the high number of the functionalities of BMP280 sensor\n\
    allowed us to signiﬁcantly reduce the overall size of the realized BLE tag, maintaining\
    \ at the\nsame time very low its power consumption. Three diﬀerent operating modalities\
    \ are available,\nto optimize the power consumption in low-power applications.\
    \ To detect the ammonia concentration,\na Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)\
    \ MOX gas sensor (model MiCS-5914, manufactured by\nSensortech, Inc., Oxnard,\
    \ CA, USA) was employed, featured by a 1–500 ppm detection range, a sensing\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n21 of 43\nresistance in the air between 10 KΩ and 1500\
    \ KΩ and sensitivity factor (Rair/R1 ppm) between 1.5\nand 15. A MiCS-5914-based\
    \ breakout board (manufactured by Feng Tai Co., Hong Kong, China),\nequipped with\
    \ an acquisition and transmission section based on the STM32 MCU (manufactured\
    \ by\nST Microelectronics Co., Geneva, Switzerland), was interfaced with the HM10\
    \ board by I2C serial\ncommunication (Figure 10c). The built-in 93 Ω pull-down\
    \ resistor in series to the internal heater\nof the MOX sensor was substituted\
    \ with a 47 Ω resistor, to power supply the board with 3.3 V\nand still ensuring\
    \ the right value (2.2 V) of the heater voltage; furthermore, a high-side channel-P\n\
    metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (PMOSFET) switch was added to\
    \ turn oﬀ the sensor,\nto reduce the power consumption when the sensor tag is\
    \ in the idle mode.\nFigure 10. (a) CCS811 breakout board for detecting total\
    \ volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and\neCO2 concentration; (b) BPM280 breakout\
    \ board used for monitoring environmental temperature and\nhumidity; (c) MiCS-5914\
    \ breakout board for detecting the ammonia concentration.\nThe three sensors were\
    \ interfaced through the I2C bus with the CC2541 TWI (two-wire interface)\nmodule\
    \ corresponding to the pins 15 (serial data—SDA) and 20 (serial clock—SCL) of\
    \ the HM-10\nboard, placing two 4.7 KΩ pull-up resistors on the two lines. In\
    \ addition, the CCS811 sensor was kept\nin sleep condition when no measurement\
    \ was required, thus reducing the current absorbed by the\nsensor (i.e., only\
    \ 19 µA with a 1.8 V power supply); the sensor was woken up by putting down the\n\
    nWAKE line (low active) through a GPIO (i.e., PIO11 pin) of the HM-10 board and\
    \ then setting the third\nmeasurement modality (called Mode 3) in the MEAS_MODE\
    \ register; after, 10 min have to be expected\nbefore the measurement. Similarly,\
    \ also the ammonia sensor (MiCS-5914) was turned on 10 min before\nthe reading,\
    \ so allowing the sensor to reach the optimal operative temperature. Such time\
    \ interval was\ndetermined through diﬀerent experimental tests carried out on\
    \ the two gas sensors (for TVOC and CO2\nand NH3, respectively), by comparing\
    \ the obtained measures with those provided by two commercial\ngas detectors,\
    \ namely a TVOC and CO2 combined detector (model ZN-202S, manufactured by Air\
    \ Ae\nSteward, Inc., Shenzhen, China) and another for Ammonia (model WASO-XM,\
    \ manufactured Hunan\nGri Instrument Co., Hunan, China).\nThe power supply section\
    \ is based on the XC6206-3.3 step-down voltage regulator for adapting\nthe voltage\
    \ provided by the 2500 mAh Lipo battery (model LIPO785060 manufactured by Pkcell\n\
    battery Co., Shenzhen, China) to 3.3 V required by all the devices included in\
    \ the BLE tag (Figure 11).\nThe power consumption analysis of the BLE tag prototype\
    \ is reported in the Section 4.2, as well as the\ndescription of the proposed\
    \ tracking and tracing system based on the BLE smart tags and the mobile\napplication\
    \ is detailed in the Section 5.1.\nThe cost of the developed BLE smart tag is\
    \ low, about 25–30 € including all sections, despite its\nsuperior functionalities\
    \ compared to other competitor devices present on the market, which usually\n\
    monitor only a single quantity (e.g., temperature or a single gas species). However,\
    \ this cost is easily\ndepreciable, given that the device is reusable for a long\
    \ time, as previously described.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n22 of 43\nFigure 11.\

    \ constituting\nthe BLE smart tag.\n4. Results\n4.1. Functional Testing and Power\
    \ Consumption Analysis of Designed WSN Node\nThe developed WSN was tested in order\
    \ to determine the eﬀective power consumption of each\nnode typology and thus\
    \ establish the energy autonomy of the employed power supplying device.\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ the power consumption of a sensor node for diﬀerent operating modes and scenarios\n\
    are below reported. As described above, the original ESP8266 NodeMCU voltage regulator\
    \ (model\nAMS1117-3.3) was replaced with a more eﬃcient one (model MCP1825S-3302E)\
    \ in terms of quiescent\ncurrent and dropout voltage to reduce the node power\
    \ consumption.\nPower consumption is an essential factor in the performance and\
    \ life of WSN. To analyze network\noperation, we take into account that each node\
    \ sends its name, an ID message that identiﬁes the number\nof data packets sent\
    \ by each node, the Wi-Fi signal strength in the transmission and the sending\
    \ time.\nThis work emphasizes energy consumption due to the impact of Wi-Fi and\
    \ BLE technologies. While\ninteresting, other performance metrics, as the communication\
    \ statistics, are not considered in this\nanalysis, but are expected to be proposed\
    \ in future work. Some of these parameters are related to the\nnumber of packets,\
    \ where all the messages could be sorted by node and number of sent messages\n\
    in order to obtain the lost messages in the network. With this arrangement, the\
    \ messages that were\nnot labeled as consecutive numbers are searched to verify\
    \ that there was no jump. In addition, the\nnodes have timers that control the\
    \ losses or delays and sliding windows for the ﬂow control in the\nsending of\
    \ data. In addition, since the network keeps all the nodes synchronized, it is\
    \ enough to\nsubtract the reception time and the emission time to remove the latency\
    \ in the reception of messages.\nIt is interesting to note that the nodes continue\
    \ to send the message numbers without interruption,\ndemonstrating a high network\
    \ capacity against failures.\nThe experimental setup for power consumptions analysis\
    \ is depicted in Figure 12; the sensor\nnode was fed with 3.7 V, provided by a\
    \ power supply generator (model E3631A, manufactured by\nAgilent Technologies,\
    \ Santa Clara, CA, USA), directly applied to the voltage regulator input, voltage\n\
    value chosen to reproduce the real use of the node fed by the LiPo battery or\
    \ 90 F super-capacitor.\nA digital oscilloscope (model DSO5072P, manufactured\
    \ by Hantek, Shandong, China) was used to\nacquire the voltage drop waveforms\
    \ across a 4 Ω sensing resistor in series with node power supply\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3632\n23 of 43\nline, for determining absorbed current values during the\
    \ diﬀerent operating phases (inset of Figure 12).\nIn order to accurately measure\
    \ the very low absorbed current during deep sleep modality, also a digital\nmultimeter\
    \ (model GDM8351, manufactured by Gwinstek, Taipei, Taiwan, with 1 µV resolution)\
    \ was\nplaced in parallel to the 4 Ω sensing resistor. In addition, from the acquired\
    \ signals, the time duration\nof each node operating phase is determined to calculate\
    \ the related energy consumption.\nIn Figure 13a, the oscilloscope traces related\
    \ to the 4 Ω sensing resistor terminals (yellow and light\nblue lines) and to\
    \ their diﬀerence (purple) are reported, thus being able to easily distinguish\
    \ each node\nfunctioning mode, namely the wake up (green box), unsuccessful data\
    \ transmission to an unavailable\ncoordinator node (yellow box) and subsequent\
    \ return to the deep sleep modality (NodeMcu switching\noﬀ, red box). As above\
    \ described, the sensor node tries to establish a connection with the coordinator\n\
    node for a time duration of 20 s (as depicted in the ﬂowchart of Figure 9), otherwise,\
    \ it returns in\ndeep sleep mode to reduce its power consumption (Figure 13a).\
    \ The absorbed current values from the\nsensor node, during all the operating\
    \ phases, are then determined.\nFigure 12. Experimental setup to determine sensor\
    \ node power consumption in the diﬀerent functioning\nmodes, namely coordinator\
    \ node searching-data acquiring and transmission–deep sleep mode.\nFigure 13.\
    \ (a) Oscilloscope traces acquired during unsuccessful connection attempt of the\

    \ mode to reduce the power consumption;\n(b) oscilloscope traces acquired during\
    \ a successful connection of the sensor node with coordinator\nnode; only 5.6\
    \ s were required to complete the data detection and transmission phases.\nIn\
    \ Figure 13b, the same signals of Figure 13a are reported when a connection was\
    \ established\nbetween the sensor node and the corresponding coordinator. At ﬁrst,\
    \ the sensor node wakes up from\ndeep sleep mode, switches on the connected sensors\
    \ to acquire interest data and then establishes a\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n24\
    \ of 43\nconnection with the coordinator node; in this phase, the data are acquired\
    \ by sensors and sent to the\ncoordinator node (red box). Finally, the ESP8266\
    \ NodeMCU switches oﬀ the connected sensors (green\nbox) and returns in deep sleep\
    \ mode (yellow box) for 30 min, as described in Figure 9. Similarly, the\ncurrent\
    \ values and time duration of diﬀerent operative phases were determined; the time\
    \ interval\nneeded to complete the acquisition and transmission phases is equal\
    \ to 8.7 s (Figure 13b), while a\n5.6-s-long time is required for the only data\
    \ transmission. The time interval required to establish the\nconnection varies\
    \ over the diﬀerent operating cycles according to the availability of coordinator\
    \ node;\nhowever, a 3.1 s mean value was determined based on the several carried\
    \ out experimental tests.\nGiven the above-reported data relative to both time\
    \ durations and current values during the\ndiﬀerent sensor node operating phases,\
    \ its energy consumptions can be calculated. Because a 4 Ω\nsensing resistor was\
    \ used, the voltage drop across it and the corresponding absorbed current associated\n\
    with each operative phase, are following reported in Table 1.\nTable 1. Absorbed\
    \ current and time duration values, extracted by the oscilloscope traces, related\
    \ to the\ndiﬀerent node operating phases.\nSensor Node Modality\nVoltage Drop\

    \ the energy\nconsumption estimate of the whole sensor node operating cycle is\
    \ given by the following relation:\nEstimated Energy Consumption = 1800 s × 0.067\

    \ V by placing on the LTC3105-based conditioning board the\njumper for enabling\
    \ the 5 V output voltage) were calculated as following reported:\n•\nDeep-sleep\

    \ sensor node operating cycle is given by:\n∆V = ∆V1 + ∆V2 + ∆V3 = 1.340 mV +\
    \ 0.694 mV + 2.185 mV = 4.219 mV,\n(5)\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n25 of 43\nConsidering\
    \ that the sensor node carries out 48 cycles for each day and that its minimum\

    \ from the solar panel for recharging the 90 F super-capacitor storage\ndevice\
    \ is totally absent due to the bad weather conditions (unrealistic eventuality).\n\
    Afterwards, the sensor node was power supplied by a 100 mAh single cell LiPo battery,\

    \ current and charge values obtained are very similar to those previously\nreported.\
    \ Therefore, the electric charge needed to complete a single operating cycle is\
    \ given by:\nQTOT = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = 0.034 mAh + 0.018 mAh + 0.058 mAh = 0.110 mAh,\n\
    (10)\nGiven that the system performs 48 operating cycles per day and assuming\
    \ a 30% LiPo battery\ndischarge margin, the sensor node autonomy could be expressed\
    \ by the following relation:\nAutonomy [gg] = 0.7 × Battery Capacity [mAh]\n48\
    \ × QTOT [mAh]\n= 0.7 × 100 mAh\n48 × 0.11 mAh = 13.26 gg,\n(11)\nA 70% discharge\
    \ margin was supposed because within that limit the LiPo battery can ensure the\n\
    right supply voltage for the sensor node (minimum value = 3.2 V), below that state\
    \ of charge then\nthe battery voltage goes down suddenly. Therefore, a sensor\
    \ node energy autonomy greater than\n13 days was obtained with the developed system,\
    \ in conditions of absence or limited availability of\nsolar energy to recharge\
    \ the used storage device. The diﬀerent discharge proﬁle of LiPo batteries\nrespect\
    \ to super-capacitors allows a greater sensor node energy autonomy, thus the LiPo\
    \ batteries must\nbe considered more appropriate for the considered application.\n\

    \ Modalities and Power Characterization of Developed BLE Smart Tag\nThe prototype\
    \ of the BLE smart tag was realized by placing the sensing breakout boards on\
    \ a\nprototyping board and realizing the connections on its back (Figure 15);\
    \ to simplify the wiring, the\nHM-10 module was soldered on an adapting board\
    \ in order to expose all its pins, making easy the\nconnection with the programmer.\
    \ In addition, the voltage regulation section, based on the XC6206-3.3\nIC, was\
    \ placed on the back of the prototyping board, as well as the LiPo battery on\
    \ the bottom of the\nplastic box, under the electronic boards; for sake of clarity,\
    \ the LiPo battery is shown in Figure 15,\nbesides to the board. All the mentioned\
    \ components were positioned inside a plastic box, with a\nperforated cover to\
    \ allow the right detection of parameters inside the container where the BLE sensor\n\
    tag is installed.\nFigure 15.\nThe prototype of the developed BLE smart tag placed\
    \ inside a plastic box with a\nperforated cover.\nThe operation modality of the\
    \ developed BLE smart tag is described in the ﬂowchart reported in\nFigure 16;\
    \ at ﬁrst, the setting of diﬀerent interfaces and registers of the CC2541 IC (microcontroller\n\
    on board to the HM-10 control module) has to be deﬁned, to allow connection with\
    \ the employed\nsensors. Afterward, for a time interval equals to the wake_up\
    \ period (default value 24 h), the HM-10\nmodule is set in the iBeacon modality,\
    \ broadcasting an advertising packet every 546.25 ms (time\ninterval between the\
    \ advertising packets, as detailed in Figure 18a) by exploiting the halSleep()\
    \ and\nosal_set_event() methods of the BLE v1.4.1 stack; when the module doesn’t\
    \ transmit any advertising\npackets, the HM-10 module brings itself in PM3 low\
    \ power modality, so allowing a great reduction of\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n27\
    \ of 43\nthe power consumption. Once the sleep timer overﬂows the wake_up time\
    \ interval (default value\n24 h), the HM-10 module is switched to the active mode,\
    \ thus waking up the CCS811 sensor and\nswitching on, by the CMOS switch, the\
    \ MiCS-5914 sensor for 10 min allowing them to reach their\noperative temperature;\
    \ as previously described, such time interval was experimentally determined,\n\
    as the minimum value required by the two sensors for reaching their operative\
    \ temperature. After\nthis time interval, also the BMP280 temperature and moisture\
    \ sensor is woken up and then all the\ndata are acquired from the sensors and\
    \ elaborated for extracting the aforementioned parameters (i.e.,\ngas concentrations,\
    \ temperature and humidity, Figure 16). Afterward, each parameter is compared\n\
    with speciﬁc thresholds, chosen as a function of the stored agri-food product\
    \ typology, since each food\ntypology is featured by a storage temperature and\
    \ speciﬁc gas types that indicate the food spoilage, as\nreported in the literature\
    \ [59,67,68] (Figure 16); besides, such threshold values depend on the shape\n\
    and size of the food container, on the positioning into the container of the tag\
    \ respect to the product\nlevel, as well as on the presence of ventilation, namely\
    \ if the food package is sealed or open. The\nthreshold values can be set or modiﬁed\
    \ by reprogramming the BLE smart tag, every time that the\nagri-food product stored\
    \ in the container is changed.\nFigure 16. Flowchart related to the operation\
    \ modality of developed Bluetooth low energy (BLE) smart\ntag placed inside the\
    \ container where the agri-food products are stored.\nIf abnormal parameter values\
    \ are detected, the wake_up period is halved compared to the previous\none, up\
    \ to a minimum value of 6 h; afterward, only if no monitored parameter is beyond\
    \ the preset\nlimits, the wake_up period is reset to 24 h (Figure 16). Following,\
    \ the BLE tag enables the deep sleep\nmode for the BMP280 and CCS811 sensors and\
    \ turns oﬀ the MiCS-5914 sensor and then it establishes\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n\
    28 of 43\nthe connection with the Bluetooth gateway, towards which transmits the\
    \ acquired data along with a\nwarning byte, which indicates if a certain parameter\
    \ has assumed an abnormal value (alarm condition).\nSpeciﬁcally, 5 bits of the\
    \ warning byte are associated with the 5 parameters acquired by the BLE tag,\n\
    arranged as depicted in Figure 17 (each bit set to “1” logic in case of an alarm\
    \ condition). Finally, the\noperating cycle above described starts again with\
    \ the BLE smart tag set in the iBeacon modality, with\nthe same setting previously\
    \ reported, for the time interval (24 h or 12 h or 6 h), as determined in the\n\
    previous cycle.\nFigure 17. Structure of the warning byte transmitted from the\
    \ BLE tag to signal an alarm condition\nrelated to the acquired parameters.\n\
    During both iBeacon modality and data transmission phase of the BLE smart tag,\
    \ the transmitted\npower was set to 0 dBm by using hciStatus_t HCI_EXT_SetTxPowerCmd()\
    \ method, in order to comply\nwith the detection range requirements described\
    \ in the following Section 5.1.\nAfterward, the BLE smart tag was tested for determining\
    \ its overall power consumption, thus\nestablishing the energy autonomy. A GDM8351-model\
    \ digital multimeter was placed in series to\nthe power supply line of the BLE\
    \ tag, for acquiring the current values with a 100 ms sampling rate\nto determine\
    \ the power consumption for each operative phase. In Table 2, the measured current\n\
    values are summarized, along with the time duration of each phase determined by\
    \ placing a 10-Ω\nsensing resistor in series to the power supply line and monitoring,\
    \ with a DSO5072P-model digital\noscilloscope, the voltage drop on the sensing\
    \ resistor. The measures were carried out by considering\na 24 h wake_up period\
    \ and the time durations reported in Table 2 refer to a single operative cycle\n\
    of the BLE tag (set of phases outlined in the ﬂowchart of Figure 16). In addition,\
    \ in Figure 18a the\noscilloscope traces related to the 10-Ω sensing resistor\
    \ terminals (yellow and green lines) and their\ndiﬀerence (purple) are reported,\
    \ during the iBeacon modality of BLE smart tag; as it can be noted\nfrom Figure\
    \ 18b, a 130 mV peak value for the 10-Ω drop voltage was measured during the packet\n\
    transmission (time duration of 5 ms), corresponding to a 13 mA absorbed current.\
    \ As can be noted in\nFigure 18a, the time interval between the iBeacon packet\
    \ transmissions, represented by the current\nabsorption peaks, is equal to about\
    \ 545 ms, time interval previously set during the setting phase of\nthe CC2541\
    \ module (Figure 16). Thanks to the ﬁrmware strategies implemented in the ﬂowchart\
    \ of\nFigure 16 for the power consumption minimization of the diﬀerent modules,\
    \ a very long lifetime (more\nthan 5 months) of the employed LiPo battery was\
    \ obtained, as reported below.\nTable 2. Current absorbed by the BLE smart tag\

    \ voltage drop is equal to 130 mV, corresponding to an absorbed current value\
    \ of\n13 mA.\nOnce measured the current values for each BLE tag operative phase,\
    \ then the overall charge\nrequired to carry out an operating cycle was calculated\
    \ as follows:\n•\niBeacon phase:\nQ1 = 0.237 mA × 24 h = 5.688 mAh,\n(12)\n•\n\
    Heating phase of the gas sensors:\nQ2 = 28.287 mA × 600\n3600 h = 4.714 mAh,\n\
    (13)\n•\nAcquisition and transmission phase:\nQ3 = 8.675 mA × 1.426\n3600 h =\
    \ 0.003 mAh,\n(14)\nThe overall charge required for a single operative cycle of\
    \ the BLE tag is given by the\nfollowing formula:\nQTOT = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = 5.688\
    \ mAh + 4.714 mAh + 0.003 mAh = 10.405 mAh,\n(15)\nFollowing, assuming a 30% LiPo\
    \ battery (with a 2500 mAh capacity) discharge margin, the energy\nautonomy of\
    \ the BLE smart tag was determined:\nAutonomy [gg] = 0.7 × Battery Capacity [mAh]\n\
    QTOT [mAh]\n= 0.7 × 2500 mAh\n10.405 mAh\n= 168.20 gg,\n(16)\nTherefore, an energy\
    \ autonomy greater than 168 days (i.e., 5.6 months) was obtained for the\ndeveloped\
    \ BLE sensor tag, fully satisfactory for the considered application.\n5. Discussion\n\
    As discussed above, the smart making-decisions section of developed IoT-based\
    \ farm facility is\nthe software platform, enabling the control and management\
    \ of all its functionalities and oﬀering to the\ncustomers some value-added services\
    \ related to the traceability of agricultural products; speciﬁcally,\nthe platform\
    \ includes the so-named Campaign Registry application, able to monitor and establish,\
    \ in\nan optimized way, the fertigation treatments for each monitored land area\
    \ on the basis of the following\ninputs and agronomic models:\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 3632\n30 of 43\n•\nWSN data related to environmental, soil and crops parameters;\n\
    •\nUser inputs, namely data entered, through the dedicated “Farm App” installed\
    \ on the\nsmartphone/tablet, by the farmer or agronomist;\n•\nData obtained by\
    \ reliable weather stations;\n•\nPurchase orders, namely information able to inﬂuence\
    \ the growth or production of a speciﬁc crop\nif the market requires greater or\
    \ lower production levels.\nThe cloud database is managed by professional users\
    \ (as informatics or agronomists) in order to\nconstantly update the set of information\
    \ (temperatures, soil data, fertilizer types, fertigation periods,\nweather conditions,\
    \ crops growth status), taking into account any change in the state of the land\
    \ over\ntime, for optimizing the quality and yield of cultivated products and,\
    \ at the same time, preserving\nthe soil wellbeing with consequent advantages\
    \ for the ecosystems. Furthermore, the agronomist can\nupdate the data into the\
    \ on-cloud database on the basis of the on-ﬁeld observations related to the crop\n\
    phenological development. In addition, he can also check the fertigation system\
    \ correct operation\nby sending a “status query” through the smartphone app to\
    \ the remote management platform as\nwell as he can identify a land portion with\
    \ his smartphone by reading the QRcode, placed near each\nportion of the cultivated\
    \ land, in order to view or update the related information contained in the\n\
    “Campaign Register” application of the software platform and ﬁnally he can request\
    \ the execution of a\nspeciﬁc treatment of fertigation or against pests, on the\
    \ considered land portion bypassing the remote\nautomated management.\nThe developed\
    \ software platform automatically stores detailed information concerning the\n\
    treatments performed on followed cultivations during the whole growth period,\
    \ allowing the customers\nto verify, through a suitable user interface, the treatments\
    \ carried out on the considered agricultural\nproducts, and thus their quality,\
    \ but also to place a purchase order. Through the developed platform,\nthe consumers\
    \ can monitor the whole supply chain of the agri-food products, obtaining information\n\
    concerning the freshness and genuineness of the agricultural product, so enabling\
    \ additional revenues\nto the farmer.\nIn addition, the data and parameters of\
    \ the general agronomic database can be\nmonitored and updated by the farmer or\
    \ agronomist, as well as they can manage the execution of\nspeciﬁc treatments\
    \ through the developed platform. The customers can access only to the information\n\
    concerning performed treatments and to product traceability [69]. The data derived\
    \ from the agronomic\nmodels, crucial for the fertigation system operation, are\
    \ stored both in the on-cloud database and in\nthe local one, data concerning\
    \ the nutritional needs of each considered crop typology as function the\nseasonal\
    \ period, growth phase and speciﬁc environmental/geographical/meteorological conditions.\n\
    In fact, the possible system operation modes are two, namely:\n•\nBottom-Up modality:\
    \ the master is a stand-alone component (PC of the solar-powered fertigation\n\
    system) where the main operating activities are performed, stored and synchronized\
    \ with the\non-cloud platform (remote server). In this way, the service is guaranteed\
    \ even if the Internet\nconnection is absent or not always guaranteed.\n•\nTop-Down\
    \ modality: the master is the on-cloud architecture that manages and commands\
    \ the\nneeded operations to be performed by the solar fertigation system; moreover\
    \ the farmer can\nremotely set the fertigation cycles and land sections, where\
    \ to carry out the farming treatments.\nThe fertigation system has two user levels,\
    \ namely:\n•\nLevel 1—System Management: the authorized user can access to each\
    \ software section and\napplication as a master user, can create a lower-level\
    \ user (farmer/customer), visualize and\nremotely control each installed fertigation\
    \ system and manage all their operations. Further, he can\nupdate the general\
    \ agronomic database by adding further crops to be cultivated or modifying the\n\
    parameters and calculation algorithms;\n•\nLevel 2—Farmer or Customer: he is associated\
    \ with a single fertigation system, can set the crops\nin the diﬀerent areas of\
    \ the land (only the farmer), control automatically or manually the irrigation\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n31 of 43\nor fertigation cycles (only the farmer), view\
    \ the history of crops parameters and certiﬁcation\nreports of the carried out\
    \ treatments.\nThe developed application comprises a traceability system of cultivated\
    \ crops, named Customer\nFree Campaign Register, an open-source tool, connected\
    \ to the general agronomic database, by which the\ncustomer can verify the farming\
    \ processes and quality standards, even before arranging the purchase\norder,\
    \ so providing an added value for the farmer. The software platform allows enabled\
    \ users to\nremotely interact with the farm management system, for example, to\
    \ check the historical register of the\ndiﬀerent carried out agricultural processes\
    \ or to update the agronomic database based on observations\ndirectly on cultivated\
    \ land related to crop growth.\nIn order to highlight the functionalities and\
    \ utility of developed smartphone application for the\nfarmers or customers, following\
    \ some screenshots are shown and described. In Figure 19a, the “view\nsection”\
    \ is shown from which the farmer (user M1) can check the irrigated sectors (green\
    \ color); clicking\non “Status” button, the enabled user can control soil and\
    \ crops parameters detected by the WSN\nwhereas with the M-button he can manually\
    \ command a speciﬁc process for the considered land sector\nbypassing what established\
    \ by the DSS on the basis of the agronomic models. In Figure 19b, the “Data\n\
    history section” for sector 1 is shown with the chronology of the WSN data and\
    \ performed treatments;\nto such section, both the farmer and customer users can\
    \ access from their account.\nFigure 19. Screenshots of the realized application:\
    \ “view section” where the farmer (user M1) has a\ncomplete overview of the cultivated\
    \ crops (a) and “Data history section” through which the farmer or\ncustomer monitor\
    \ crops’ parameters and the performed treatments for growth optimization (b).\n\
    Finally, to verify the correct functioning of the developed IoT-oriented farm\
    \ management facility\nconstituted by the sensor nodes installed in the cultivated\
    \ ground and by the cloud software platform,\ndiﬀerent measurement campaigns were\
    \ carried out actually on cultivated lands and the obtained\nresults have certiﬁed\
    \ the correct functioning of the hardware and software sections.\n5.1. Proposed\
    \ Tracking and Tracing System for Monitoring the Storage Conditions of Agri-Food\
    \ Products and\nReal Tests of the Designed BLE Smart Tag\nAs previously described,\
    \ the proposed farm management and control system includes a traceability\nsystem\
    \ of the agri-food products along the whole SC able to monitor and share the main\
    \ indicators for\ndetermining the storing and transport conditions. This system\
    \ is based on the BLE smart tags, with\nthe structure described in the Section\
    \ 3.3, placed into the containers where the agri-food products are\nstored. Once\
    \ the products arrive at a storage warehouse, the UUID of newly arrived containers\
    \ are\ndetected by the Bluetooth gateway (called “Incoming Bluetooth Gateway”,\
    \ in Figure 20) located near\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n32 of 43\nthe warehouse\
    \ unloading area; when a new UUID is found, the incoming gateway updates, through\
    \ a\nWi-Fi gateway, the new container location in the relative record, associated\
    \ with the detected UUID, in\nthe cloud database (i.e., an Azure SQL database).\n\
    Figure 20. Schematic representation of the proposed tracking and tracing system\
    \ based on the BLE\nsmart tags.\nA commercial Bluetooth gateway (model BTP104-SS,\
    \ manufactured by Jinou, Chongqing, China)\nwas employed for carrying out detection\
    \ and communication tests of the BLE smart tags with the\non-cloud platform (as\
    \ represented in the scenario of Figure 20); by setting the transmitted power\
    \ level\nof each BLE tag to 0 dBm, a detection range of 12 m was obtained, particularly,\
    \ in the condition in\nwhich the tagged containers are stacked for their transportation,\
    \ reaching instead up to 21 m detection\ndistance in the open ﬁeld condition.\
    \ Therefore, a gateway can be located at the warehouse entrance for\ndetecting\
    \ the incoming containers, whereas inside the warehouse the gateways have to be\
    \ regularly\ndistributed (at a distance of 12 m from each other) for receiving\
    \ the data transmitted by the tags\n(Figure 20).\nAfter the detection of a new\
    \ container, the Bluetooth gateway sends to the remote database a\npacket containing\
    \ its identiﬁer (i.e., the UUID) along with a code related to the new storage\
    \ warehouse\n(Figure 20). The UUID is the key for all the operations carried out\
    \ in the database, namely to insert,\nselect, update, delete and call an item.\
    \ Afterward, the food products are stored in the warehouse and the\nBLE smart\
    \ tags, placed into the containers, periodically send the acquired parameters,\
    \ suitably arranged\nin data packets, to the Bluetooth gateways located inside\
    \ the warehouse. Speciﬁcally, a 27 bytes packet\nis transmitted by each BLE tag,\
    \ with the ﬁrst 16 bytes represent its UUID, 6 bytes are related to the\nTVOC,\
    \ CO2 and NH3 concentrations and 2 bytes each for the environmental temperature\
    \ and humidity\n(as depicted in Figure 20). Finally, the warning byte is added\
    \ to the packet to signal anomalies of the\nmonitored parameters, as described\
    \ in the Section 4.2. The data related to a given container, then,\nare stored\
    \ into a record of the on cloud database, related to the BLE tag UUID; when a\
    \ container\nleaves the warehouse towards another one, it passes nearby another\
    \ gateway, called “outcoming\nBluetooth gateway”, which updates the database reporting\
    \ its exit. The afore-described mechanism\ncontinues until the containers are\
    \ delivered to the food shop or wholesaler, where also the empty\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3632\n33 of 43\ntagged containers are picked up by the farmer to be following\
    \ reused; the data stored in the database\nrelated to a given UUID are removed\
    \ after the expiration date of the food product.\nThe user can assess the tracking\
    \ and storage information of the agri-food products employing a\nmobile application\
    \ designed by using the Android Studio 3.6.1 development environment.\nAfter the\
    \ login, the user (indicated with R, Figure 21a) is directed into the main page\
    \ of the\napplication, where the container UUID can be entered typing the alphanumeric\
    \ characters in the\nappropriate ﬁeld and by pushing the “Track” button, the user\
    \ is directed to the page related to the\ndesired container (Figure 21a). Afterward,\
    \ by pushing the “Par. History” button (Figure 21b), the\nuser can verify the\
    \ history of each monitored parameter pressing the button related to the desired\n\
    quantity (i.e., T, H for humidity, VOC, NH3 and CO2); a visual indicator is added\
    \ above each button to\nsignal abnormal values of the corresponding parameter.\
    \ In addition, the temporal trend of the selected\nparameter is shown (e.g., the\
    \ temperature in Figure 21b) along with its mean and peak values.\nFigure 21.\
    \ Application screenshots of the tracking and traceability system based on BLE\
    \ tags. (a) logged\nuser (R) inserts the container universally unique identiﬁer\
    \ (UUID); (b) “Par. History” section with\nshown the history of acquired parameters;\
    \ (c) “Tracking Info” section where the customer checks the\ntracking information\
    \ related to the entered UUID.\nBy pushing the “Tracking Info” button, the user\
    \ can monitor the tracking information of the\nconsidered container (Figure 21c);\
    \ in fact, this page contains a table where are detailed all the movements\nof\
    \ the container, updated over time by means of the tracking system above described.\n\
    Several tests were performed for validating the operation of the BLE tags and\
    \ related tracking\nsystem; the BLE smart tag was placed inside a plastic box\
    \ (with 50 cm × 40 cm × 40-cm dimension)\ncovered by a perforated lid (30 holes\
    \ with 0.6-cm diameter), containing 5 kg of oranges, leaving the box\ninto a refrigerator\
    \ set to a 5 ◦C target temperature for 20 days. On the 20th day, the plastic container\n\
    was taken out of the freezer and left at room temperature (about 20–25 ◦C) for\
    \ further 10 days. The tag\nwas ﬁxed by means of screws on the inner surface of\
    \ the plastic container, 10 cm above the product\nlevel since, from preliminary\
    \ tests, this position can ensure a good detection capability to the device,\n\
    and, at the same time, avoid some false alarms due to local gas accumulation.\
    \ However, the container\ndimension, shape and ventilation aﬀect the response\
    \ of the BLE smart tag, since these factors determine\nthe gas concentration and\
    \ distribution inside the container; therefore, a preliminary characterization\
    \ of\nthe BLE tag, before to be used for the speciﬁc container, is required to\
    \ determine the threshold values\nfor each gas species. For the case under consideration,\
    \ the threshold values were determined based on\nvisual and olfactory observations\
    \ and set to 581 ppb for TVOC, 176 ppm for NH3 and 1647 for CO2.\nIf the concentration\
    \ of a gas species exceeds the aforementioned threshold or the temperature and\n\
    humidity values are outside the set intervals (0–10 ◦C and 30–70% for oranges,\
    \ respectively), an alarm bit\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n34 of 43\nis set in the\
    \ warning byte and sent to the software platform along with the acquired information.\
    \ Besides\nthe temporal trends, the mobile application shows the user the warning\
    \ on the monitored quantities, as\na visual indicator which turns red (from green)\
    \ in case of alarms. For instance, in Figure 21b, the data\nrelated to the container\
    \ with oranges are reported; once the container is removed from the refrigerator,\n\
    the indicator related to the temperature (marked with T) changes from green to\
    \ red.\nThe temporal trends of the monitored parameters are shown in Figure 22;\
    \ as it can be noted, the\nmeasurements are temporally closer from the 20th day,\
    \ since the detected temperature is higher than\nthe upper threshold (set to 10\
    \ ◦C) and thus the wake_up period is progressively reduced up to 6 h, as\ndetailed\
    \ in the Section 4.2 (Figure 22a). After removing the box from the refrigerator,\
    \ TVOC values\nincreased signiﬁcantly due to the fastening spoiling process into\
    \ the stored oranges [70,71]. In addition,\nthe measurements showed an increase\
    \ of CO2 and NH3 values throughout the measuring range, slow\nin the refrigerator\
    \ and faster outside, reaching peak values of 3022 ppm and 287 ppm, respectively\n\
    (corresponding to 5439.6 mg/m3 and 199.6 mg/m3). Following, a reduction of CO2\
    \ and NH3 values\nin the last days of the observation interval was observed, as\
    \ already reported in the literature [70]\n(Figure 22b).\nFigure 22. Temporal\

    \ frozen codﬁsh ﬁllet placed inside a polystyrene box\nwith 40 cm × 40 cm × 20\
    \ cm dimension, covered by a plastic wrap and leaving the container to 0 ◦C\n\
    for 20 days; then the box is removed from the freezer and left uncovered to room\
    \ temperature for\nother 10 days. The BLE tag was attached to the internal surface\
    \ of the polystyrene box, 10 cm above\nthe ﬁsh level, in order to monitor the\
    \ storing conditions and the gas levels emitted by the codﬁsh\nﬁllets; the related\
    \ temporal trends, over the whole observation interval, are reported in Figure\
    \ 23.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3632\n35 of 43\nSimilarly, the BLE tag characterization\
    \ for the container with ﬁsh inside was performed, to determine\nthe threshold\
    \ values, so obtaining 389 ppb and 256 ppm values for TVOC and NH3, respectively;\n\
    besides, the temperature and humidity ranges were set to 0–10 ◦C and 20–70%. Thus,\
    \ if a detected\nvalue isn’t included in the corresponding set range, an alarm\
    \ message is sent to the software platform\nand reported on the mobile application\
    \ by means of the visual indicator (turned red) related to the\nabnormal parameter\
    \ (Figure 21b). In the ﬁrst phase, the NH3 concentration increases slowly although\n\
    in the refrigerator, since the enzymatic and bacteria growth decomposes the ﬁsh\
    \ proteins even at a\ntemperature of a few degrees [72], so producing nitrogen\
    \ volatile compounds that indicate the spoiling\nof the ﬁsh. This trend has accelerated\
    \ after the defrosting (from the 20th day) reaching a peak value\nof 274 ppm (i.e.,\
    \ 190.5 mg/m3) after about 4 days, then the NH3 concentration reduced indicating\
    \ an\nadvanced decomposition of ﬁsh proteins, as already reported in [73] (Figure\
    \ 23b). A CO2 concentration\nnear to the lower limit of the MiCS-5914 sensor (i.e.,\
    \ 400 ppm) was detected before the box left the\nfreezer, values ascribable to\
    \ the environmental concentration inside the box; in fact, once the box was\n\
    extracted from the freezer and removed the plastic wrap, the CO2 concentration\
    \ is increased slightly\naround the value of 500 ppm, due to the indoor environment.\
    \ TVOC concentration, initially, grew\nslowly (up to 170 ppb) until the box was\
    \ in the freezer, increasing then quickly when the box was\nextracted, reaching\
    \ a maximum value of 626 ppb at the end of the observation interval (10 days after\n\
    the defrosting).\nFigure 23. Temporal trends of the parameters detected by the\

    \ Facility in Real Scenarios\nAfterward, diﬀerent measurement campaigns were carried\
    \ out on-ﬁeld for testing the operation\nof all the fertigator sections, but also\
    \ the proper integration of the software platform, implementing the\nagronomic\
    \ database, with the developed WSN and the weather forecast; in this way, the\
    \ beneﬁts in\nterms of water savings and proper fertilizer usage were evaluated.\n\
    At ﬁrst, the system was tested on a land of 1200 m2 cultivated with tomatoes,\
    \ arranged in rows\nequipped with a drip irrigation system and divided into three\
    \ sectors. In this case, a fertigation unit\nequipped with a 5000 L mixing tank\
    \ and 3 hp pump (model HF-8B, manufactured by Pedrollo Spa, San\nBonifacio, Italy)\
    \ was employed. A WSN constituted by 6 sensor nodes, two for each sector, was\
    \ installed\nwith one of them acting as coordinator node. The considered land\
    \ is featured by slightly clay soil (i.e.,\na high TAW—total available water value),\
    \ whereas the tomato plants are in the development phase\n(20 days from the planting);\
    \ speciﬁcally, the reported tests were carried out on 22 July 2019, during\na\
    \ week characterized by high environmental temperatures and humidity. In these\
    \ conditions, the\nagronomic database scheduled a unique irrigation per day, lasting\
    \ an hour and a half, corresponding\nto 1800 L water amount for each sector; in\
    \ addition, the agronomic database established a fertigation\nprocess with 7.5\
    \ kg of N–P–K soluble fertilizer (with 9–30–22 ratios) dissolved into the water\
    \ amount\nof a normal irrigation.\nAs previously cited, the developed system schedules\
    \ irrigation and fertigation processes according\nto the crops need and WSN data,\
    \ reducing the occurrence of under- or over-watering conditions, thus\nminimizing\
    \ any plants stress. In Figure 24a, the temporal trend of soil humidity in the\
    \ sector 2 is shown;\nthe irrigation was scheduled for 6:00 P.M. (post meridiem),\
    \ if the soil water content (average value of\nthe data provided by the two sensors)\
    \ was lower than the set threshold (40%, Figure 24a). However,\nfrom 2:00 P.M.\
    \ to 5:00 P.M. a heavy rainfall occurred, thus the soil humidity exceeded the\
    \ 40% value,\nand the scheduled irrigation was canceled, so obtaining water-saving\
    \ and avoiding tomatoes-plants\nstress due to overwatering. In fact, in Figure\
    \ 24a the simulated humidity values, if the irrigation had\nnot been canceled,\
    \ are reported, calculated taking into account the soil composition (i.e., soil\
    \ hydraulic\nconductivity K equals to 7.0 × 10−9 ms−1), and the amount of precipitated\
    \ water using the Darcy’s\nlaw [74]. For the same day, in Figure 24b, the temporal\
    \ trends of soil and environmental temperature\nare shown; such parameters along\
    \ with the status of the fertigation system are shown to the farmer\nthrough the\
    \ mobile application, as above described (Figure 19a).\nIn addition, the developed\
    \ farm management facility was tested inside a 1700-m2 greenhouse\nwhere lettuce\
    \ plants were cultivated; the greenhouse was equipped with suspended sprinkler\
    \ irrigation\nimplant and a centralized dehumidiﬁer to control the environmental\
    \ temperature and humidity for\noptimizing the growth conditions as well as reducing\
    \ rotting and the spread of diseases and pests.\nSpeciﬁcally, the greenhouse was\
    \ divided into three sectors each equipped with three sensor nodes, one\nof which\
    \ conﬁgured also as coordinator node; a fertigation unit with a 500-L mixing chamber\
    \ and a\n3-hp pump (model HF-8B) was installed to irrigate three sectors consecutively.\n\

    \ water value) and the lettuce plants are next to harvesting phase;\ntherefore,\
    \ the agronomic database scheduled, for each day, an irrigation in the morning\
    \ (at 7:00 A.M.,\nAnte Meridiem) and a fertigation process in the evening (at\
    \ 7:00 P.M.) for a time duration of 30 min\n(corresponding to 1600 L), if the\
    \ average soil humidity was lower than 40%. The fertigation consisted\nof dissolving\
    \ 1.7 kg soluble N–P–K fertilizer, with 15–5–20 ratios, into the water amount\
    \ of a normal\nirrigation. In Figure 25, the temporal trend of soil humidity (blue\

    \ In addition, the detected air temperature and humidity values\n(red and green\

    Thanks to the recent availability of advanced hardware and software solutions\
    \ that allow farmers\nto control in real time the growth, the harvest and subsequent\
    \ transformation of cultivated crops,\nthe agricultural companies can increase\
    \ yields, nutritional quality and safety, from the health point\nof view, of the\
    \ cultivated products, reduce production costs and negative impacts on the health\
    \ and\nenvironment, in line with the modern principles of economic, environmental\
    \ and social sustainability.\nA management and traceability system, that employs\
    \ modern technologies, was developed able to\nsupport the activities of farms\
    \ in their productions as well as users of the cloud platform in controlling\n\
    the cultivation processes directly on-ﬁeld and to trace the products harvested\
    \ from the land along the\nentire production chain. A fertigation system was developed,\
    \ to manage the frequency and typology of\nthe irrigation processes, controlled\
    \ by an on-cloud software platform implementing a decision-making\nalgorithm based\
    \ on the information provided by the weather service and a WSN installed on the\
    \ ﬁeld.\nSpeciﬁcally, the decisions on timing and fertilizer amount are based\
    \ on a complete state-of-the-art\nagronomic database, which represents the smart\
    \ section of the fertigation system, reproducing, for a\ngiven crop typology,\
    \ the needs in terms of water and fertilizers as a function of the season, growth\
    \ phase,\nsoil typology, along with the soil and environmental parameters. The\
    \ information in the agronomic\ndatabase was determined by collecting and synthesizing\
    \ the results of previous scientiﬁc works and\nwell-known agronomic models (such\
    \ as the nutrient balance-NB one) and made available to the\nsoftware platform\
    \ by means of an on-cloud MySQL database. The integration of the fertigation system\n\
    with a custom agronomic database represents the main innovation of proposed work.\
    \ The designed\nWSN node is energetically autonomous thanks to a solar harvesting\
    \ system properly sized; also, the\nsensor node ﬁrmware architecture was discussed,\
    \ as well as the operating modalities for managing data\nacquisition from sensors\
    \ and the communication towards the WSN coordinator node. In particular, the\n\
    power consumption of the WSN nodes was minimized exploiting the built-in low-power\
    \ modalities of\nthe NodeMCU board and properly conﬁguring the timing of the acquisition\
    \ and communication phases,\nalong with the status of the connected sensors. Experimental\
    \ tests were performed for estimating the\nnode power consumption in the diﬀerent\
    \ operative phases, obtaining a long lifetime of the used LiPo\nbattery (more\
    \ than 13 days without any availability of solar energy, an unrealistic extreme\
    \ case).\nIn this way, an automated and traced management of the treatments performed\
    \ on a particular\nland section is obtained, reducing water and fertilizer waste,\
    \ as well as minimizing the stress-induced\non the plants, thus enhancing the\
    \ crop yield. A suitable mobile app allows users to fully control\nall the functionalities\
    \ of the fertigation system, but also to verify all the treatments performed on\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3632\n39 of 43\na given land section. In addition, the developed\
    \ fertigation system enables the implementation of\nspeciﬁc management strategies,\
    \ aimed at anticipating or delaying the product collection, actuated\nby properly\
    \ tuning the irrigation/fertigation timing, on the basis of the customers’ requests;\
    \ this\nscientiﬁc innovativeness allows the farmer to achieve economic beneﬁts\
    \ as well as a reduction of the\nagri-food waste.\nA tracking and tracing system,\
    \ based on BLE smart tags, was designed capable to monitor the\nmovements of the\
    \ agri-food products from the cultivation ﬁeld to the consumers and their storage\n\
    conditions. To reduce the power consumption of developed BLE tag, commercial microcontroller\
    \ and\nsensor breakout boards were modiﬁed, resulting in a long-time reusable\
    \ device, a novelty compared to\ncompetitor systems reported in the scientiﬁc\
    \ literature as well as on the market. The chemical/physical\nquantities detected\
    \ by the BLE smart tag were chosen in order to provide reliable markers of the\n\
    freshness status of diﬀerent product typologies (vegetables, meat, ﬁsh, etc.),\
    \ making it a versatile\ninstrument adaptable to diﬀerent scenarios. Respect to\
    \ existing scientiﬁc works where only one\nphysical or chemical quantity is monitored\
    \ to detect the spoiling of the speciﬁc stored product, instead,\nthe designed\
    \ BLE tag is able to simultaneously detect several quantities, so covering a wide\
    \ range of\napplications. In addition, the threshold values involved in the HM-10\
    \ ﬁrmware have to be set as a\nfunction of the food typology, amount of the stored\
    \ product, as well as the typology and size of the\nused container; in this way,\
    \ the designed BLE tag can be easily adapted, after a prior characterization,\n\
    to every container typology. Furthermore, by optimizing the HM-10 ﬁrmware, both\
    \ in iBeacon and\nacquisition modalities and implementing proper operating strategies,\
    \ a reduced power consumption\nof the BLE tag was ensured.\nThe prototype of the\
    \ BLE smart tag, based on the CC2541 IC and low-cost sensors, was tested to\n\
    validate its operation and determine the energy autonomy (up to 5.6 months), value\
    \ to our knowledge\nnot achieved by other devices present in literature, considering\
    \ also that our BLE tag allows detecting\ndiﬀerent chemical/physical quantities,\
    \ as already highlighted before. The user can remotely access the\ntracking and\
    \ storing information by means of a properly developed mobile application synchronized\n\
    with the on-cloud traceability database. Several tests were carried out to verify\
    \ the tag functionalities;\nspeciﬁcally, we have reported the results related\
    \ to the BLE tag applied to a closed plastic or polystyrene\nbox with inside oranges\
    \ or codﬁsh ﬁllets, respectively and monitoring the interest parameters for\n\
    30 days (20 days in the refrigerator and 10 days outside) by employing the developed\
    \ mobile application.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.V. and N.I.G.;\

    \ and give exact data extraction\nand analysis. The main objective of this paper\
    \ is to detect the most appropriate plant development parameters. This paper has\n\
    the concept of reducing the hazards in agriculture and promoting intelligent farming.\
    \ Advancement in agriculture is not new,\nbut the AI-based wireless sensor will\
    \ push intelligent agriculture to a new standard. The research goal of this work\
    \ is to\nimprove the prediction state using image processing-based machine learning\
    \ techniques. The main objective of the paper, as\ndescribed above, is to detect\
    \ and control cotton leaf diseases. This paper comprises several aspects, including\
    \ leaf disease\ndetection, remote monitoring system depending on the server, moisture\
    \ and temperature sensing, and soil sensing. Insects and\npathogens are typically\
    \ responsible for plant diseases that reduce productivity if not timely. This\
    \ paper presents a method to\nmonitor the soil quality and prevent cotton leaf\
    \ diseases. The proposed system suggested uses a regression technique of\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence to identify and classify leaf diseases. The information would be\
    \ delivered to farmers through the Android\napp after infection identiﬁcation.\
    \ The Android app also allows soil parameter values like moisture, humidity, and\
    \ temperature\nto be displayed along with the chemical level in a container. The\
    \ relay may be on/oﬀ to regulate the motor and chemical\nsprinkler system as required\
    \ by using the Android app. In the proposed system, the SVM algorithm delivers\
    \ the best accuracy\nin detecting various diseases and demonstrates its eﬃciency\
    \ in the detection and control by the improvement of cultivation for\nthe farmers.\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe information technology of the farming sector is cur-\nrently\
    \ regarded as a concern to confront the many diﬃcul-\nties that arise in the area.\
    \ The development of eﬃcient and\nmore proﬁtable agriculture systems and instruments\
    \ is\nquickly increasing with environmental monitoring and\nremote control in\
    \ agriculture [1]. Precision agriculture and\nintelligent agriculture can lead\
    \ in this direction. These two\nphrases concern the integration, with traditional\
    \ agricultural\nHindawi\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume\
    \ 2022, Article ID 6534238, 11 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6534238\nmethods,\
    \ of sophisticated technologies for the production of\ngood crops [2]. Intelligent\
    \ agriculture systems can supply\nfarmers with signiﬁcant environmental data from\
    \ their ﬁelds\nto enhance competitiveness and proﬁt. Nearly every area of\nagriculture\
    \ can beneﬁt from such technical developments,\nfrom plantation and irrigation\
    \ to plant protection and har-\nvesting. When the AI is integrated into the cloud,\
    \ processes\nbecome intelligible and judgments involving human involve-\nment\
    \ are made ﬂuently [3, 4]. Diverse strategies for resolving\ncontemporary issues\
    \ in agriculture have been presented,\nfrom databases to predictive analysis.\
    \ As far as precision\nand eﬃciency are concerned, systems using AI have proved\n\
    to be the best results [5]. Farming is a vibrant area, and the\ncircumstances\
    \ to deliver a meaningful solution cannot be\ngeneralized. The AI approaches enable\
    \ us to collect and\nrespond optimally to the unique challenge of the compli-\n\
    cated characteristics of each case. The development of vari-\nous\nAI\nsystems\n\
    gradually\nsolves\nextremely\ncomplex\nproblems. In agriculture, multiple approaches\
    \ to agriculture\nare adapted quickly to AI. The concept of smart systems\nenables\
    \ farmers to recognize crops, analyze the soil, provide\nexpert advice, and develop\
    \ business opportunities. This leads\nto stochastic AI technologies that enable\
    \ agricultural pro-\nduction to recognize, collect, and respond to diﬀerent condi-\n\
    tions (depending on the knowledge gained) to increase\neﬃciency [5, 6]. By following\
    \ new progress in the agricul-\ntural sector, farmers can oﬀer solutions via platforms\
    \ such\nas chatterbots that beneﬁt from the ﬁeld. Global agriculture\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence is predicted to increase signiﬁcantly\n[7, 8]. It was aimed at\
    \ improving the eﬃciency of daily agri-\ncultural activities such as the adoption\
    \ of robots and drones,\nprotocols to monitor crop health, computerized irrigation\n\
    systems, and tractors without a driver. This paper was aimed\nat emphasizing the\
    \ usage of WSN and IoT in agriculture and\nat presenting an in-depth analysis\
    \ of sensor and IoT data\nanalytics utilizing AI approaches for applications in\
    \ agricul-\nture. The approach is to detect and control cotton leaf dis-\neases\n\
    and\nmotivate\nto\nincrease\nthe\napplication\nin\nagriculture-based application.\n\
    This paper organized as follows. Section 2 provides liter-\nature survey, and\
    \ Section 3 has presented the materials and\nmethods. Section 4 described the\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence in\nagriculture. Section 5 proposed the novel approaches\
    \ and\nperformances. Section 6 discusses the analyzed result, and\nﬁnally, Section\
    \ 7 concluded the proposed work conclusion.\n2. Literature Survey\nArtiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) technologies have predicted the\nbehavior of nonlinear systems and have\
    \ contributed to con-\ntrolling variables to improve system-operating conditions.\
    \ A\nrecent analysis highlights the emergence of artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence as\
    \ part of solutions for enhanced farm productivity.\nSharma et al. [1] suggested\
    \ that solar-powered IoT sen-\nsor nodes monitor and operate the agricultural\
    \ sectors.\nOperations such as crop management, crop harvesting,\nwater supply\
    \ control, control of animals, distribution of pes-\nticide, moisture, and temperature\
    \ measuring technologies\nwill also be monitored and controlled in agriculture.\n\
    Suchithra [2] suggested that sensors can detect ﬁeld\nconditions such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, humidity, and\nfarm fertility. The value of sensing is authenticated\
    \ and\nthen transmitted to the Wi-Fi, and the veriﬁed data from\nthe Wi-Fi module\
    \ is transmitted via the cloud to the\nmobile or laptop of the farmer. If the\
    \ ﬁeld requires care,\nfarmers are also informed by SMS. An algorithm with\ntemperature,\
    \ humidity, and fertility thresholds is created\nthat can be conﬁgured to manage\
    \ water quantity in an\nMCU node. From anywhere in the world, farmers may\ncontrol\
    \ the engine.\nJoshi [3] described the construction of the wireless agri-\ncultural\
    \ environmental sensor nodes to monitor climatic\nconditions and deduct the optimum\
    \ external conditions for\nhigh crop yields in a speciﬁc agricultural ﬁeld. This\
    \ research\nfocuses on the literature on the construction of the wireless\nagricultural\
    \ environmental sensor nodes to monitor climatic\nconditions and deduct the optimum\
    \ external conditions for\nhigh crop yields in a speciﬁc agricultural ﬁeld. Agriculture\n\
    and food production is a sector that has recently remitted\nits concentration\
    \ to WSN, which seeks to raise its produc-\ntion and the agricultural yield benchmark\
    \ using these cost-\neﬀective modern technologies. In recent years, wireless sen-\n\
    sor networks (WSNs) have been attracting great attention.\nMekonnen [5] discussed\
    \ that the present analysis is a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the implementation\
    \ in sensor\ndata analytics within the agroecosystem of diﬀerent machine\nlearning\
    \ algorithms. It covers a case study on an integrated\nfood, energy, and water\
    \ (FEW) systems based on IoT-\ndriven smart farm prototypes.\nSangeeta et al.\
    \ [4] suggested that machine learning\napproach is intended to forecast the best\
    \ crop yield in a cer-\ntain area through the analysis of several climatic parameters,\n\
    such as precipitation, temperature, and dampness, soil pH,\nsoil type, and previous\
    \ plant crop records.\nGhadge [6] suggested that farmers monitor the soil\nfertility\
    \ based on data extraction analyses. The method,\ntherefore, focuses on the monitoring\
    \ of soil quality to\ndetermine the crop ﬁt for production by type of soil and\n\
    to maximize crop production using the right fertilizer\nrecommended.\nSujawat\
    \ [7] discussed that the enormous uses of artiﬁcial\nintelligence are in many\
    \ domains. Artiﬁcial intelligence can\nbe of tremendous help in addressing agricultural\
    \ illnesses\ndue to its ability to understand the problems and develop\nthe right\
    \ reasons for them and ﬁnd ideal solutions for them.\nThe study gives a quick\
    \ introduction of artiﬁcial intelligence\napplication in agriculture, its available\
    \ farming practices,\nand the numerous ways available to detect disease in plants.\n\
    Kshirsagar and Akojwar [8–11] elaborate on the use of\nartiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ for diﬀerent classiﬁcation and predic-\ntion problems and furthermore explained\
    \ the use of hybrid\nartiﬁcial intelligence for feature extraction, classiﬁcation,\n\
    and prediction along with modeling with diﬀerent algo-\nrithms and optimization\
    \ techniques. Signiﬁcant demonstra-\ntion in the domains of artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ case-based\nreasoning, multiagent optimization, scheduling, data min-\ning,\
    \ web crawlers, comprehending and translating natural\nlanguages, and virtual\
    \ vision reality [12–14].\n2\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n3.\
    \ Materials and Methods\n3.1. Use of WSN in Agriculture. Spatial-temporal climatic,\n\
    hydrographic, pressure, movement, the wetness of the soil,\neco-psychological\
    \ plants, plagues, and the reporting to the\nfarmer of optimal alternatives are\
    \ possible using wireless sensor\nnetworks [9]. It would be a tremendous boon\
    \ for him to have\nsuch knowledge routinely. Automatic control equipment can\n\
    be used to control irrigation, fertilization, and pest control to\naddress adverse\
    \ situations which confront farmers. Mainte-\nnance of irrigation is also one\
    \ of the most crucial precise farm-\ning chores [5]. The small parasitoid wasp\
    \ Microplitis croceipes\nﬁnds caterpillars attacking cotton crops by placing onto\
    \ a com-\nplicated organic cocktail, which is issued when assaulted from\nthe\
    \ plant. Sensors capable of detecting this cocktail might result,\nwith much-targeted\
    \ pesticide treatments or warp introductions,\nin the early detection and mitigation\
    \ of this attack.\nDiverse elements, including soil type and temperature,\ndiﬀer\
    \ substantially in precision farming (PA) from area to\narea; any irrigation system\
    \ therefore must be ﬂexible to suit\nthese diﬀerences. Irrigation regulators are\
    \ frequently costly\nto manage precious water resources [10]. They are not eﬃ-\n\
    cient at all. Moreover, WSNs are still under improvement;\nfor instance, they\
    \ are sometimes inaccurate, delicate, and\nhungry for power and can easily lose\
    \ contact in a hostile\nenvironment, especially in agriculture [6]. Cultivation\
    \ ﬁeld\nsurveillance is critical for agricultural eﬀectiveness in reduc-\ning\
    \ resource waste and increasing yields in activities such as\nirrigation and fertilization\
    \ because it allows farmers to access\nand decide upon sound information on climate\
    \ factors, soil,\nand plant situations and changes in plant life [15]. Although\n\
    agricultural ﬁeld monitoring generally involves manpower,\none-oﬀ agro weather\
    \ stations, and wired sensor network sys-\ntems, the high density and ﬂexible\
    \ deployment of instru-\nments for collecting data in real time is necessary for\
    \ this\nissue, immersed in precise farming [11]. WSNs have been\ndeveloped to\
    \ provide low-cost, ﬂexible, easy-to-use, and\nhigh-precision beneﬁts in real\
    \ time for agricultural monitor-\ning. We highlight the applications for agriculture\
    \ and farm-\ning that can be used with WSNs [5, 6].\n3.1.1. Irrigation Management\
    \ System. Agricultural produc-\ntion demands a better irrigation system to maximize\
    \ water\nuse in agriculture. Another cause for the need for an\nimproved system\
    \ is the frightening decrease in the ground-\nwater level [16]. This setting has\
    \ a cost-eﬀective and water-\neﬃcient method of micro-irrigation. However, depending\n\
    on environmental and soil knowledge, microirrigation eﬃ-\nciency may be further\
    \ increased. WSNs are used as the orga-\nnizing mechanism in this respect.\n3.1.2.\
    \ Farming System Monitoring. Several upgraded technol-\nogies and equipment are\
    \ presently being employed in agricul-\nture. In this respect, the enhanced method\
    \ for managing this\nequipment makes operation generally easier and allows auto-\n\
    mation for famine. Furthermore, remote surveillance devices\naid better management\
    \ of large-scale farms [17]. Moreover,\nthe system quality can be enhanced by\
    \ providing extra data\nsuch as satellite photos and weather forecasts.\n3.1.3.\
    \ Pest and Disease Control. Increased quality of crops\nand minimized agricultural\
    \ expense are helped by controlled\nutilization of pesticides and fertilizers.\
    \ However, we must\nmonitor the likelihood and presence of pests in crops to con-\n\
    trol the use of pesticides [16]. We require information about\nthe environment,\
    \ such as temperature, moisture, and wind\nspeed, for this purpose. A WSN can\
    \ observe these occur-\nrences independently and can anticipate them in a ﬁeld\
    \ of\ninterest.\n3.1.4. Controlled Use of Fertilizers. The growth of plants and\n\
    their quality depends directly on fertilizer application. How-\never, it is demanding\
    \ work to optimally feed fertilizers in\ngood ﬁelds. Monitoring of the variation\
    \ in land nutrition\nsuch as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and\n\
    pH can be carried through the application of fertilizers for\nagriculture. The\
    \ balance of soil nutrition can therefore be\nsustained, as well as the quality\
    \ of the crop [18].\n3.1.5. Groundwater Quality Monitoring. The growing use of\n\
    fertilizers and pesticides reduces groundwater quality. Con-\ntrol of water quality\
    \ by placing sensor nodes is enhanced\nby wireless technology [3].\n3.1.6. Remote\
    \ Control and Diagnosis. Farm equipment like\npumps, lighting, heaters, and valves\
    \ in machines also can\nbe remotely controlled and diagnosed using the Internet\
    \ of\nThings [5].\n4. Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture\nIn its vigorous\
    \ technological discovery and the huge applica-\ntion region, artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) is one of the major\nresearch solutions in software development. AI’s key\
    \ idea\nin agriculture is ﬂexibility, fast performance, accuracy, and\ncost viability\
    \ [4, 19]. Artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture\nnot only helps farmers utilize\
    \ their farming talents but also\nleads farmers to increase returns and improve\
    \ the quality\nwith less expense [7, 8]. AI-based technology for wireless\nsensors\
    \ enhances the eﬃcient functioning of all sectors and\naddresses the issues faced\
    \ by numerous sectors in the agri-\nculture industry such as crop harvesting,\
    \ irrigation, and soil\ncontent sensitivity. AI technology enables plant disease,\n\
    pests, and malnutrition diagnostics on farms, and AI sensors\ncan supervise the\
    \ agricultural parameters and control them\n[20, 21].\n5. Proposed System\nThe\
    \ system uses a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor,\nan optical sensor, a ground\
    \ moisture sensor, a soil pH sen-\nsor, and a camera module for data collection.\
    \ The ﬁeld\ncharacteristics are monitored using LCD monitors and\nmobile applications.\
    \ The sprayed chemical in the plants\nis controlled via the solenoid valve in\
    \ Figure 1. The ﬁrst\nimage is taken from the camera and detected and dis-\nplayed\
    \ in the app by image infection picked, when farmers\ntake the appropriate steps\
    \ after disease identiﬁcation, i.e.,\nby using an app to spray pesticides or fertilizers\
    \ to convert\nON/OFF into the water [22]. The ON/OFF external\n3\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\ndevices are controlled by the relay driver. With the assis-\n\
    tance of a sensor, farmers may also control the soil and\nwater level in a tank.\
    \ For soil condition and water level\nand pesticide tank measurement, four diﬀerent\
    \ kinds of\nsensors are used. These sensors comprise a sensor [18], a\nhumidity\
    \ sensor, a sensor of water, and a humidity sensor.\nAll of these sensors have\
    \ a Raspberry Pi interface. For\nmoving the whole system, motor drivers and DC\
    \ motors\nare used. The movable system monitors the status of the\nground in diﬀerent\
    \ locations.\n5.1. IoT Cloud for the Proposed Method. To provide data\nand transport\
    \ the data between devices, this IoT cloud\nplays an essential function. The storage\
    \ is kept indepen-\ndently for every analysis, such as sensor output, item rec-\n\
    ognition, illnesses of plants, and predictive big data\nanalysis [3, 5, 7]. Moreover,\
    \ farmers can gain knowledge\nthrough Internet services from agroexperts about\
    \ smarter\nagriculture and future forecasting. Services are designed\nto provide\
    \ insights on crop planting, control of pesticides,\nand land management. In the\

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nconventional farmer may use these\
    \ services to prepare\nhimself. The server is powered by IoT devices and unbe-\n\
    lievably easy to operate.\n5.2. IoT Device and Sensors. This section comprises\
    \ several\nsensor types, cameras, display units, microscopic controllers,\nand\
    \ network components, like routers and switches. The sen-\nsors’ characteristics\
    \ are conditioned according to the predicted\nduties performed by actuators [6].\
    \ The central processing\nunit’s main focus is on the transmission of information\n\
    between components utilized to process IoT systems.\n5.3. Wi-Fi. In the proposed\
    \ system, wireless ﬁdelity plays a\ncrucial role in IoT deployment. A high-speed\
    \ Internet is\navailable via IEEE 802.11X to communicate with the user\n[16].\
    \ The built-in wireless network allows the robot to com-\nmunicate the gathered\
    \ data on the server and user interface\napplication via smart mobiles.\n5.4.\
    \ Smartphone. All data collected in the ﬁeld are used in the\nuser interface application\
    \ to appear on a mobile phone. It is\na mobile phone software program that designs\
    \ and works.\nThe application information in the ﬁeld is revealed [23].\n5.5.\
    \ Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a system for gathering data\nfrom numerous sensors.\

    \ and Mobile Computing\nby the Raspberry Pi over wireless networks, the data is\
    \ deliv-\nered to the database cloud [8, 9]. To forecast the output of\nplant\
    \ disease, the data collected from the cloud were previ-\nously processed and\
    \ analyzed by AI.\n5.6. HD Camera. Anything in the ﬁeld can be recorded and\n\
    provided to the user using a mobile app. The digital camera\nprovides the fundamental\
    \ ingredients for capturing images\nand videos [24].\n5.7. Sensor Unit. The plant’s\
    \ growth is mainly determined by\nthe elements of environment and climate and\
    \ the amount of\nwater and fertilizer irrigation. Fluid nutrition factors must\
    \ be\nmonitored and managed in a limited range of desired levels\nto ensure optimal\
    \ growth. The parameters shall include\nnutrient temperature, pH, and EC concentration\
    \ [3, 5]. If\nthe parameters exceed the acceptable range, plants can dam-\nage\
    \ it. Further parameters can be changed to improve fur-\nther growth, e.g., air\
    \ temperature, relative humidity, and\nlight intensity, and CO2 concentrations.\
    \ Some sensors are\nthe primary way to address challenges related to the moni-\n\
    toring and management of increasing spatial circumstances\n[6, 16]. The sensor\
    \ can detect and monitor a range of param-\neters such as temperature, moisture,\
    \ the intensity of light,\nand CO2. The following details are provided by its\
    \ function\nand operating process and the advantages that the key sen-\nsor oﬀers.\
    \ Image processing-based leaf disease detection is\nshown in [14]; this also analyzes\
    \ the CNN-based transfer\nlearning model.\n(i) Soil sensor: this sensor is used\
    \ to measure the\namount of soil moisture and water. Two huge\nexposing pads constitute\
    \ a sensor and work on the\nelectric conductivity key. Resistance of the soil\n\
    moisture sensor, which is the main determinant of\nplant development, is inversely\
    \ related to moisture\ncontent. If less than required water voltage is\nreduced,\
    \ analog voltage will enable the farmer to\ndiscover the water shortfall. This\
    \ sensor is utilized\nacross the ﬁeld to manage the quantity of water\nand any\
    \ other essential automation [17]. The water-\ning system in the greenhouse was\
    \ improved by the\nwireless moisture sensor network\n(ii) Light intensity sensor:\
    \ as we know, all plants and\nﬂowers require great sunshine, and every group of\n\
    plants reacts diﬀerently to the intensity of the light.\nSome plants work well\
    \ with low intensity of light\nand some with high intensity of light [16]. The\n\
    farmer must supply enough light quantities for the\nhealthy plant for at least\
    \ 8 to 10 hours per day. Arti-\nﬁcial lighting is a superior way to develop a\
    \ healthy\nplant with suﬃcient intensity [13]\n(iii) Temperature sensor: one of\
    \ the essential parameters\nregulating plant growth and development is temper-\n\
    ature. Lower temperatures are frequently the result\nof inadequate plant growth.\
    \ The photosynthesis\nand genotype growth demand a varied level of tem-\nperature,\
    \ which can advance plant growth [23]. The\noptimal temperature on the ground\
    \ should not be\nless than 4°C and more than 30°C for successful\nplant growth\n\
    (iv) Humidity sensor: the sensor is used for the sensa-\ntion and measurement\
    \ of comparative air humidity.\nThe real temperature of the air and humidity of\
    \ the\nTable 2: Analysis of time and chemical sprayed according to the\nnumber\

    \ and Mobile Computing\nair is measured. Moisture aﬀects plant leaf growth,\n\
    pollination, and photosynthesis directly and indi-\nrectly in many ways. The health\
    \ of the leaf does\nnot depend only on photosynthesis but also on the\nphysical\
    \ cell development process that may be\nobserved using a moisture sensor [13]\n\
    (v) CO2 sensor: to maintain the root metabolism in the\nnutritional solution,\
    \ the necessary levels of oxygen\nin the root environment are vital. The level\
    \ of oxy-\ngen in the root environment is particularly signiﬁ-\ncant since low\
    \ levels inﬂuence the breathing of the\nroot, its nutrient absorption, and thus\
    \ plant growth\n(vi) pH sensor: the pH sensor is used to accurately mon-\nitor\
    \ the number of nutrients needed to be irrigated\nin the soil. The pH value is\
    \ monitored to supply\nthe plants or crops with the needed amount of\nnutrients\
    \ for healthy growth [18, 23]\n5.8. Motor Driver. The DC motor that is attached\
    \ to the\nwheels is utilized to drive the driver. It is a current ampliﬁer\nthat\
    \ regulates the motor power and converts a low-power\nsignal into a high-powered\
    \ motor signal and vice versa [20].\n5.9. DC Motor. The DC engine is an electric\
    \ machine that\ntransforms electrical power into mechanical energy. The\nmain\
    \ components of the DC engine are the current-\ncarrying frame [21] connected\
    \ to the supply by the switch\nand contacts. It works on the basis that “the current-\n\
    carrying driver in the magnetic ﬁeld has mechanical force.”\n5.10. Robot Movement.\
    \ DC motors are utilized for robot\nmovements that are electronically regulated\
    \ by the Rasp-\nberry Pi. The wireless module takes signals from the input\nand\
    \ transmits them to the processor, which turns the engine\naround. DC engines\
    \ are switched on and oﬀ when the signal\nis received by permitting a certain\
    \ pin for the Raspberry Pi\n[15, 24]. An adequate velocity is provided by 300\
    \ rpm DC\nmotors.\n5.11. Pesticide Spraying Mechanism. The Raspberry Pi digital\n\
    key’s Wi-Fi module connection receives a message from the\nmobile app on a smartphone.\
    \ The drifting sensor and sub-\nmersible pump have been placed in the pesticides.\
    \ The pump\nis connected on one end of the tube and the other end with\nthe sprayer\
    \ nozzle [25]. The user can use the mobile applica-\ntion to spray a speciﬁed\
    \ pesticide if the plant suﬀers from\nany illness.\n5.12. Data Acquisition. In\
    \ the data acquisition segment, the\ndata acquisition unit is established in various\
    \ sensor nodes.\nThe data collection module is used in agricultural produc-\n\
    tion to collect information from processing variables in real\ntime (temperature,\
    \ light intensity, humidity, nutritional\nproduct solution level, atomization\
    \ quantities, and photos\nof plants and sick plants). Finally, the control and\
    \ manage-\nment sector is a central processing unit of the system\n(CPU). The\
    \ CPU system includes various critical duties\nincluding Raspberry Pi and WRTnod,\
    \ which are designed\nfor the storage, management [5, 6, 8], and transfer of data\n\
    acquired from nodes to the webserver in real time. This tech-\nnology allows farmers\
    \ to monitor and control the operation\nremotely through the smartphone app.\n\
    5.13. Image Preprocessing. Image preprocessing uses various\npreprocessing techniques\
    \ to eliminate image noise or\nanother removal of objects. The pixel size of the\
    \ original\nimage is large, and it takes more time for the whole proce-\ndure\
    \ [9, 12]. After the image has been converted into mini-\natures, the pixel size\
    \ is decreasing and it takes less time.\n5.14. Image Segmentation. Image segmentation\
    \ is one of the\nmost commonly used ways for clearly distinguishing image\npixels\
    \ in a speciﬁc application [20]. It divides an image into\nseveral discrete states,\
    \ which show a large similarity of the\npixels in each area.\n5.15. Feature Extraction.\
    \ Feature extraction is a key element\nin the detection of disease. In the identiﬁcation\
    \ of an object,\nit plays a vital function. The extraction of features is used\
    \ in\nnumerous image processing applications [22, 26]. The fea-\ntures used for\
    \ the detection of illness are color, texture edges,\nand morphology.\n5.16. Classiﬁcation.\
    \ This is the last phase in the identiﬁcation\nof disease in which the classiﬁcation\
    \ system is utilized to rec-\nognize the type of leaf disease [27]. Diﬀerent types\
    \ of artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence are used for detecting leaf diseases.\n5.16.1.\
    \ Random Forest. Bagging is a new model of random\nforestry based on trees. Bagging\
    \ was aimed at minimizing\nprediction variation by averaging predictions via sampling\n\
    and substitution. Random forests supply the packing with\na new element, randomly\
    \ selecting and producing a tree with\ncharacteristic alterations and often repeating\
    \ [11, 28]; this\nprocedure ultimately measuring all forecasts is made\nTable\

    \ han-\ndles and is powerful both in terms of bias and variance.\n5.16.2. Naive\
    \ Bayes. This classiﬁer has diﬀerent dynamic fea-\ntures. Although, classiﬁcations\
    \ predict certain connections\nbetween the features and their class of the Naive\
    \ Bayes\nmodel. This reduces the data, although Naive Bayes uses\nadvanced ways\
    \ to improve eﬃciency and receive some the-\nory [21, 28]. Naive Bayes classiﬁcation\
    \ has many high-\ndimensional features with very little data training and is\n\
    highly scalable.\nIn Bayesian analysis, the probability of an event C given\n\
    an event Y is not the same as the probability of Y given C as\nin Eq (1).\nP C\

    \ as shown in Eq (2).\nWhere PðCÞ = prior probability representing the feature\n\
    vectors of crop dataset.\nPðC ∣ ZÞ = prior probability representing the class\
    \ of\ncrop dataset.\n5.16.3. Support Vector Machine (SVM). Algorithms for SVM\n\
    regression are modiﬁed to predict continued response. SVM\nregression algorithms\
    \ instead of identifying hyperplanes that\nseparate data ﬁnd a model that does\
    \ not diﬀer by value from\nthe measured data except for a small number of parameter\n\
    values that reduce error sensitivity. It is suitable for large-\nscale data when\
    \ there are a large number of predictor factors.\nPotential applications of SVM-aided\
    \ PA [26] in WSN are a\nregression for the detection and forecast of plant disease\n\
    and sensor data [28].\nThe SVM is a multitude of instances chosen as space\npoints\
    \ so that samples belonging to distinct groups are\ndivided into two groups.\n\
    The input characteristics are transferred to a higher-\ndimensional space and\
    \ can also be shown as Eq (3).\nWhere the set of nonlinear transformation and\
    \ k is the\nbias.\nFigure 2 is a ﬂow chart where the robot will operate in\nthe\
    \ initial phase, detection of soil type (soil color). It will\nexamine which sort\
    \ of crop has been sown after the detec-\ntion of the soil. It checks the health\
    \ of the crop and the soil\nbased on crops. If soil fertilization and cultivation\
    \ are not\ntroublesome, then these operations are carried out. If the\nplant and\
    \ soil are troublesome, the problem is resolved and\nthe farmer is encouraged\
    \ to take the required measures for\nthe crop, and chemical is sprayed on the\
    \ infected plants\nand monitored for a few days. If the problem ends, the issue\n\
    will be checked again. If no diﬃculty is present and the ill-\nness of the crop\
    \ is cleared, the robot will not function till\nthe next disease is detected.\n\

    \ average square error (MSE), is used to\ndetermine the durability of established\
    \ models to prevent\nplant illness [15, 24]. However, precise, speciﬁc, sensitive,\n\
    accurate, and F-score assessment matrices were used to eval-\nuate the classiﬁcation\
    \ model that has been created. Table 1\nspeciﬁed the employed model measures.\n\

    \ and Future Scope\nAgriculture is undergoing a digital transition, like numerous\n\
    industries. The amount of data from farms is collected.\nWireless, IoT, robotic,\
    \ and AI networks are being used.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence algorithms enable the\
    \ extraction from\nthe ﬂood of data of relevant knowledge and insight. The\nmajor\
    \ purpose of this work is, according to the discussion,\nto detect and monitor\
    \ cotton leaf diseases. The second\nobjective is to monitor the parameters of\
    \ agricultural\nparameters. The correct identiﬁcation and illness of the\nplants\
    \ are extremely crucial for agricultural performance,\nand this may be done with\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence. This\npaper analyzes the approach of AI for the detection\
    \ of\nan unhealthy plant leaf. Diﬀerent aspects of the infected\nsheet may precisely\
    \ identify and classify diﬀerent plant\ndiseases by removing features of the infected\
    \ sheet. This\nmethod enables the illness to be detected and pesticides\nsprayed\
    \ automatically on the aﬄicted plants and to send\nthe user information. The SVM\
    \ algorithm delivers an\naccuracy of 98.34% for the bacterial blight diagnosis\
    \ of\ndiseases and demonstrates its eﬃciency in the detection\nand control by\
    \ the improvement of cultivation for the\nfarmers. In the future, this presented\
    \ work is improved\nwith the CNN model for classifying diseases.\nData Availability\n\

    Abstract: The inclusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in greenhouses has become\
    \ a fundamental\ntool for improving cultivation systems, offering information\
    \ relevant to the greenhouse manager for\ndecision making in search of optimum\
    \ yield. This article presents a monitoring system applied to an\naeroponic greenhouse\
    \ based on an IoT architecture that provides user information on the status of\
    \ the\nclimatic variables and the appearance of the crop in addition to managing\
    \ the irrigation timing and\nthe frequency of visual inspection using an application\
    \ developed for Android mobile devices called\nAeroponics Monitor. The proposed\
    \ IoT architecture consists of four layers: a device layer, fog layer,\ncloud\
    \ layer and application layer. Once the information about the monitored variables\
    \ is obtained by\nthe sensors of the device layer, the fog layer processes it\
    \ and transfers it to the Thingspeak and Firebase\nservers. In the cloud layer,\
    \ Thingspeak analyzes the information from the variables monitored in\nthe greenhouse\
    \ through its IoT analytic tools to generate historical data and visualizations\
    \ of their\nbehavior, as well as an analysis of the system’s operating status.\
    \ Firebase, on the other hand, is used as\na database to store the results of\
    \ the processing of the images taken in the fog layer for the supervision\nof\
    \ the leaves and roots. The results of the analysis of the information of the\
    \ monitored variables and\nof the processing of the images are presented in the\
    \ developed app, with the objective of visualizing\nthe state of the crop and\
    \ to know the function of the monitoring system in the event of a possible lack\n\
    of electricity or a service line failure in the fog layer and to avoid the loss\
    \ of information. With the\ninformation about the temperature of the plant leaf\
    \ and the relative humidity inside the greenhouse,\nthe vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ (VPD) in the cloud layer is calculated; the VPD values are available on the\n\
    Thingspeak server and in the developed app. Additionally, an analysis of the VPD\
    \ is presented that\ndemonstrates a water deﬁciency from the transplanting of\
    \ the seedling to the cultivation chamber.\nThe IoT architecture presented in\
    \ this paper represents a potential tool for the study of aeroponic\nfarming systems\
    \ through IoT-assisted monitoring.\nKeywords: aeroponic; greenhouse; Internet\

    1. Introduction\nThe fundamental resources for traditional agriculture are farmland,\
    \ soil and water.\nConventional greenhouses require colossal infrastructures,\
    \ having among their limitations\nuncontrolled environments, smaller farmland,\
    \ plant diseases, soil degradation and a lack\nof resources, among others, leading\
    \ to reduced crop production [1]. With the increasing de-\nmand for food, the\
    \ role of agriculture demands the efﬁcient use of resources and increased\nSensors\

    Sensors 2022, 22, 5646\n2 of 28\nproduction. An option to improve farming systems\
    \ focuses on stress monitoring and\nstress-causing factors in cultivation [2].\
    \ Consequently, various technologies have emerged\nfor the conservation and use\
    \ of water and energy, in addition to the beneﬁts in increasing\nthe production\
    \ of multiple crops. Among the technologies that have had the most impact\nare\
    \ wireless sensor networks (WSN), computing in the cloud, fog computing, embedded\n\
    systems, big data, machine–machine (M2M) and human–machine communication (H2M),\n\
    communication protocols, application programming interfaces (API), and advanced\
    \ en-\ncryption standards (AES), as well as the use of geo-location, satellites\
    \ and servers, among\nothers [3].\nIn Mexico, it is necessary to increase agricultural\
    \ production by at least 70% by 2050,\nincreasing surface yield and reducing the\
    \ amount of water consumed [4]. Recently, organi-\nzations such as the Secretaría\
    \ de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural, the Consejo Nacional de\nCiencia y Tecnología\
    \ (Conacyt) and the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales,\nAgrícolas\
    \ y Pecuarias (INIFAP) have agreed on the collaboration on and transfer of technol-\n\
    ogy for cultivation in soil for semi-arid areas [5]. As time goes by, climate\
    \ change and water\nscarcity drive national and international organizations to\
    \ generate strategies to increase\ncrop yield by making the most of water despite\
    \ climatic adversities.\nAeroponics is a vertical cultivation method in which\
    \ the plant grows suspended over\na container, while a mist of nutrients is applied\
    \ to the roots inside a protection chamber [6].\nThe nutrient solution is atomized\
    \ on the root surface; for this, a pump is used that is in\ncharge of the oxygen\
    \ level in the root zone [7]. Since the nutrient solution is recirculated\nin\
    \ the aeroponic cultivation technique, it is important to regularly measure and\
    \ readjust\nthe pH value and electrical conductivity (EC) to have a successful\
    \ growth of the plant. If\nthe pH and EC readings are not at the proper level,\
    \ the cultivator should adjust the acidity\nand electroconductivity in the nutritious\
    \ solution so that each crop has speciﬁc EC and pH\nlevels; for example, the optimal\
    \ EC and pH values for growing onions, cucumbers, carrots,\nlettuce, tomatoes\
    \ and potatoes are between 1.5 to 2.5 ds m−1 and 5.5 to 6.5, respectively [8].\n\
    The pH and EC of a nutrient solution may be reduced due to environmental factors\n\
    such as high temperatures causing water evaporation or the absorption of nutrients\
    \ by\nplants [9]. In traditional soilless cultivation systems, such as hydroponics,\
    \ where the EC and\npH correction is performed manually, monitoring the temperature\
    \ of the nutrient solution\nis sorely needed since the results of the conductivity\
    \ and pH are directly inﬂuenced by this\nparameter [10]. The lifetime of the solution\
    \ is of the utmost importance and will depend\non timely adjustments made to the\
    \ pH, electrical conductivity and water level. To exclude\nchanges in the nutrient\
    \ solution, the volume level in the storage tank must remain constant,\nreplenishing\
    \ the water absorbed by the plants and lost by evapotranspiration, otherwise,\n\
    the concentration of the salts will change, affecting the healthy growth of the\
    \ plants [11].\nThe practice of aeroponics is adaptable in areas where the soil\
    \ is not suitable for growth\nof the plants, presenting advantages such as: a\
    \ reduction in the cost of labor, savings in\nwater of up to 98%, 60% in fertilizers\
    \ and 10% in pesticides and herbicides, and maximizing\nthe yield of the plant\
    \ to between 45% and 75% compared to geoponic or hydroponic\nsystems [8]. In comparison\
    \ to cultivation techniques such as hydroponics and substrate,\naeroponics has\
    \ revealed a signiﬁcant increment in root length, area, volume and network\nperimeter\
    \ [12,13]. With respect to traditional agriculture, in aeroponics increments of\
    \ 57%,\n42% and 400% in the number of leaves, diameter of the leaves and root\
    \ growth, respectively,\nconsidering a temperature inside the greenhouse between\
    \ 8 ◦C and 44 ◦C and a relative\nhumidity between 10% and 94%, have been observed\
    \ [14].\nOn the other hand, in Mexico, 59.5% of the population has access to the\
    \ Internet,\nwhich enables a high percentage of people to use and develop Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)\ntechnologies to improve the use of resources in agricultural\
    \ crops [15]. Having described\nthe above, assisted aeroponics with IoT tools\
    \ appears to be a very attractive alternative to\nobtain crops of greater quantity\
    \ and quality. One of the main challenges in aeroponics is to\ndetermine the atomization\
    \ time and time interval in irrigation according to the needs of\neach plant [8].\
    \ To avoid a signiﬁcant decrease in plant growth and reduction in crop yield,\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 5646\n3 of 28\nit is crucial to determine the threshold level\
    \ to which each plant can be subjected under\nconditions of irrigation deﬁciency\
    \ [16].\nWhen a crop is under water stress, the root of the plant begins to turn\
    \ dark, increasing\nits temperature. An indirect way to detect crop water needs\
    \ is through changes in crop\ntemperature and transpiration by measuring the crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI) [17],\nevapotranspiration (ET) [18], temperature difference\
    \ between the environment and the\nleaf [19] and, recently, through the vapor\
    \ pressure deﬁcit (VPD) [20]. In arid and semi-arid\nregions, a crop is under\
    \ water stress when the leaf temperature exceeds the air temperature\nfrom 4 ◦C\
    \ to 6 ◦C; likewise, a crop does not present water stress when the temperature\n\
    of the leaf is from 1 ◦C to 4 ◦C below the air temperature [21]. The water stress\
    \ index\ncan be calculated empirically by measuring the difference in temperature\
    \ between the\nenvironment and the crop and normalizing it with respect to the\
    \ differences between a\nhumid crop due to high transpiration and a crop with\
    \ low humidity due to the absence\nof moisture, or theoretically through the measurement\
    \ of solar radiation, temperature\nand humidity in the environment and the temperature\
    \ of the crop [22]. VPD and the\nchange in the temperature difference with plant\
    \ transpiration can be measured through\nleaf temperature, environmental temperature\
    \ and relative humidity [23].\nEvapotranspiration can be averaged through different\
    \ methods, with the Penman—\nMonteith method being the most globally accepted;\
    \ however, for this estimation the\nmeasurement of temperature, solar radiation,\
    \ relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric\npressure and steam pressure saturation\
    \ is required [24].\nRelated to the transpiration of a growing crop, the transpiration\
    \ rate of a crop varies\naccording to changes in atmospheric conditions, and one\
    \ of the special factors is the VPD.\nA high VPD causes an increase in the rate\
    \ of transpiration and therefore an excessive\nconsumption of water and the photosynthetic\
    \ limitation of the crop. A VPD above 1 kPa is\npotentially harmful, producing\
    \ a reduction in stomatal conductance, making photosynthe-\nsis impossible and\
    \ generating water stress even if the roots of the crop are well irrigated [20].\n\
    Reports of consecutive trials have recently been presented on crops on substrate\
    \ applied to\nSalanova lettuce considering controlled environments in light intensity\
    \ and temperature to\nmodify the relative humidity and achieve a VPD of 0.7 kPa\
    \ and 1.7 kPa during the growth\ncycle [20], following the methodology described\
    \ in [25]. In these, it was found that the\nplant area was signiﬁcantly greater\
    \ in the crop developed with a low VPD. Other studies in\ntomato cultivation show\
    \ that a low VPD moderates water stress, regulating the photosyn-\nthetic limitations\
    \ of the plant and reducing the cumulative water consumption regardless\nof soil\
    \ water status [26]. The ﬁne regulation of and the decrease in VPD ﬂuctuations\
    \ are also\ncrucial to produce a better crop growth since maintaining the photosynthetic\
    \ performance\nof the plant leads to the leaf expansion being maintained and a\
    \ higher yield being produced\nwith high nutrition values [27]. In soil tomato\
    \ cultivation systems, the applicability of IoT\nsensors was demonstrated to study\
    \ the variations in the parameters of temperature, relative\nhumidity and VPD\
    \ [28]. Signiﬁcant deviations from optimal climatic conditions due to\nimprecise\
    \ heating and cooling systems used in commercial greenhouses were revealed in\n\
    this study.\nTo address water stress, techniques based on temperature measurement\
    \ from infrared\nsensors [23] and thermographic cameras have been used in the\
    \ literature [29]. When using a\nthermal imager, a common technique for segmenting\
    \ vegetative content is the simultaneous\ncapture of visible spectrum (RGB) and\
    \ multispectral images to determine the threshold of\ncolor components, generating\
    \ a binary mask that will cover the thermal image and will\nshow only the information\
    \ of the vegetative components [29].\nIn aeroponics systems, the root development\
    \ process is crucial for the plant’s growth\nperformance. In order to optimize\
    \ the plant’s aerial parts in aeroponic culture, the appropri-\nate value deﬁnition\
    \ of irrigation water pressure, droplet size and fogging interval is needed\n\
    to improve the continuous water and nutrient availability [30,31]. Recently, non-invasive\n\
    monitoring systems have been proposed for the study of vegetative growth parameters\
    \ in\nroots and leaves developed in greenhouses [31].\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n\
    4 of 28\nImplementing and promoting the initial conditions for a healthy crop,\
    \ using IoT-\nbased technologies, requires monitoring devices with capabilities\
    \ to acquire and analyze\nenvironmental, nutritional and crop data. In order to\
    \ develop studies on soilless cultivation\nand determine better cultivation practices,\
    \ monitoring of and controlling the main sensors\nand actuators involved in the\
    \ aeroponic cultivation system are needed. The purpose of\nstudy in this paper\
    \ is to determine the feasibility of integrating intelligent sensors, for the\n\
    measurement of climatic conditions in the environment and crops as well as providing\n\
    nutrient solutions, that allow favorable conditions for crop growth in aeroponic\
    \ systems\nwith IoT-based technologies. Considered variables for our proposal\
    \ are temperature and\nrelative humidity both in the greenhouse and in the plant\
    \ leaf, VPD and luminosity, as well\nas the level, temperature, pH and EC in the\
    \ nutrient solution tanks.\nThe proposed system presents the analysis of the information\
    \ acquired by the sensors,\nthe operating status of each of the elements incorporated\
    \ in the platform using IoT analytics\nThingspeak tools, as well as the initial\
    \ preprocessing of the images acquired in the inspection\nfrom the leaf and root.\
    \ Once the plant has been transplanted to the cultivation chamber,\nthe plant\
    \ must adapt to the deﬁned irrigation scheme during the ﬁrst week; therefore,\
    \ the\noperation of each component incorporated in the proposed monitoring system\
    \ is veriﬁed\nin the same period.\nFor the experimentation, Batavia lettuce was\
    \ chosen because its duration of the cultiva-\ntion process is relatively short\
    \ compared to other crops. The monitoring system incorporates\nthe use of an application\
    \ for mobile devices capable of showing records and visualizations\nfrom the analysis\
    \ of information acquired by the built-in sensors and processed by the IoT\nanalytics\
    \ Thingspeak tools; in addition, the app records the measurements of the environ-\n\
    mental conditions, the status and readjustment of the pH and EC of the nutrient\
    \ solution,\naccess to the irrigation controls and the recirculation and the mixer\
    \ of the system.\nAdditionally, the platform has a standard thermographic camera\
    \ (8–14 µm); each of\nits captured images are transferred to the platform through\
    \ an SMB server, which allows\nthem to be viewed in the Aeroponics Monitor application.\
    \ The Aeroponics Monitor was\ndeveloped as a remote viewing and administration\
    \ tool that allows users to modify the\natomization time and the hours for the\
    \ visual inspection of the crop, as well as the turning\non and off of the sprinklers,\
    \ the recirculation system and the mixture of nutrient solution,\nas well as maintenance\
    \ tasks of the full system. The main advantages addressed by the\nproposal presented\
    \ in this study are the remote administration of system actuators, the\nmonitoring\
    \ of each of the sensors incorporated in the greenhouse, the remote capture of\n\
    images of the crops and the visualization of historical variables and data reports\
    \ on the\noperation of each of the processes that are incorporated in the monitoring\
    \ system, with all\nthe above carried out through an application for Android mobile\
    \ devices.\nThis document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature\

    \ Review\n2.1. Agriculture-Oriented IoT Architectures\nThere are multiple proposals\
    \ in the literature referring to IoT architectures used in\nintelligent agriculture;\
    \ among the most recent are AREThOU5A, AgriSens, IRRISENS,\nAgro-IoT, SWAMP and\
    \ a proposed four-layered architecture by Kour in 2020, each referring\nto soil\
    \ agriculture.\nKamienski et al. propose SWAMP, a generalized architecture oriented\
    \ to the intelligent\nmanagement of irrigation for agricultural systems on the\
    \ ground incorporating different\ninterconnection strategies between its elements\
    \ to address the problems of communication\nin greenhouses on a large-scale using\
    \ fog nodes in the soil with LoRaWAN routers. Its\narchitecture is made up of\
    \ ﬁve layers, which include the sending of information to end users,\ndistribution\
    \ models for irrigation, use of drones for vision inspection, data analysis models\n\
    in the cloud fog nodes using as references the relative humidity of the soil,\
    \ databases,\nsecurity for data acquisition, sensors, actuators and weather reports,\
    \ among others [32].\nBased on the literature reviewed by Kour et al. from 2015\
    \ to 2020 and related to the\nadvances and development of agriculture, the authors\
    \ show, as a conceptual representation,\na reference to IoT architecture for agriculture\
    \ made up of six layers (Agro-IoT), including:\na perception layer for sensors,\
    \ actuators, wireless nodes, etc.; a network layer that en-\ncompasses the communication\
    \ protocols, software middle layer, application layer for data\nanalysis and prediction;\
    \ a user layer where results are directed to farmers, experts in the\narea, the\
    \ supply chain and industries. With the aim of monitoring low-scale greenhouses\n\
    in real time, optimizing resource use, the early detection of diseases, identiﬁcation\
    \ of crop\nspecies, optimization of irrigation facilities and effective use of\
    \ pesticides and fertilizers, the\nauthors propose an IoT architecture for solar\
    \ precision agriculture with four layers, includ-\ning: a sensory layer, a network\
    \ layer considering IoT nodes and base stations; a decision\nlayer involving server\
    \ services, workstations, work and knowledge base; an application\nlayer involving\
    \ how researchers, experts and farmers receive the information [33].\nFilev et\
    \ al. propose IRISENS, which is an architecture made up of ﬁve modules: the\n\
    devices and network, kernel, external services, data management, intelligent services\
    \ and\nuser interface. In their proposal, they incorporate two models of microservices,\
    \ one oriented\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n6 of 28\nto irrigation management based\
    \ on the evapotranspiration of the crop and another for\nthe collection of data\
    \ from sensors and weather prediction services. Additionally, they\nincorporate\
    \ data authentication between each module [34].\nBoursians et al. suggest AREThOU5A\
    \ a ﬁve-layer structure involving a physical layer,\ndata link, network, authentication\
    \ and application. Its main contribution is the integration\nof a weather forecast\
    \ service to deﬁne better cultivation strategies, as well as the ability to\n\
    use machine learning in data analysis and a solar charging system for RF communication\n\
    devices located in the ﬁeld [35].\nRoy et al. propose Agrisens, described as an\
    \ architecture of three layers: sensors and\nactuators, remote processing and\
    \ service, and an application layer. The irrigation schemes\nare separated according\
    \ to the life cycle of the crop in four stages considering the situations\nwhere\
    \ the crop remains with water in the soil, irrigation under dry soil conditions\
    \ and\nirrigation under wet soil conditions. Its structure offers the farmer the\
    \ establishment of\ncommunication with the system through GSM messaging [36].\n\
    2.2. Irrigation Systems\nIrrigation systems have been used in soil and soilless\
    \ crops. Some of the most relevant\nones are described below. In soil cultivation,\
    \ there are different approaches to estimate irri-\ngation needs in cultivation,\
    \ highlighting the monitoring and control of the environmental\ntemperature, soil\
    \ moisture, evapotranspiration and water stress index. Authors such as\nGonzález-Amarillo\
    \ [37] and Fernández-Ahumada [38] use humidity and/or temperature\nmeasurement\
    \ to turn on irrigation, ventilation and heating systems, while Mohamed [39] and\n\
    Poyen [40] estimate the irrigation needs by performing the daily evapotranspiration\
    \ measure-\nment as reference. While Mohamed uses the Penman–Monteith method,\
    \ Poyen includes as a\nfeature of his system the automatic choice between the\
    \ Hargreaves and Samni, Kharufa and\nPenman–Monteith methods according to climate\
    \ type and geographical considerations.\nJamroen et al. use a fuzzy controller\
    \ to adjust the irrigation considering the variables\nof humidity and water stress\
    \ index [22], while Lloret et al. perform irrigation by ﬂooding,\nallowing automatic\
    \ irrigation by measuring crop variables and climatic conditions, or\nremote activation\
    \ using a mobile app [41].\nIn soilless farming, Puengsungwan et al. propose a\
    \ method to determine root stress\nin relation to the difference in environmental\
    \ leaf temperature and light intensity in hy-\ndroponic crops considering environmental\
    \ temperature control between 28 and 32 ◦C. In\ntheir proposal, the patterns obtained\
    \ are separated by regions considering a normal root,\nwith stress and a rotting\
    \ root. Using IoT technologies, they reduce the response time of the\nsystem from\
    \ 5 min to less than 60 s and increase the efﬁciency in detection from 85% to\
    \ 95%\nin comparison with a method based on identifying the reduction in the leaf\
    \ area of the crop\nby means of the Easy Leaf Area app [23].\nIn aeroponic crops,\
    \ the main variables monitored to manage the irrigation systems\nare the temperature\
    \ and humidity inside the greenhouse. Lucero et al., monitored the\ntemperature\
    \ and humidity inside a greenhouse used for aeroponic cultivation, establishing\n\
    the times of irrigation for the day and night under three stages according to\
    \ the days of\nproduction. In their proposal, when the temperature exceeds 35\
    \ ◦C, the irrigation period\nis reduced. In their study, they compared a crop\
    \ of 21 lettuces showing that an aeroponic\nsystem outperforms the traditional\
    \ crop in soil in terms of the number of leaves, average\ndiameter of the leaves\
    \ and average length of the root by 57%, 42% and 40%, respectively [14].\nJamhari\
    \ et al. present the control of the relative temperature and humidity in the root\n\
    chamber, in which they turn on a Peltier cell that cools the nutrient solution\
    \ maintaining a\nrange from 25 to 29 ◦C in the chamber, while the relative humidity\
    \ is controlled between 50%\nand 70% through an ultrasonic humidiﬁer and a fan\
    \ [42]. Gour et al. propose the use of a\ncentral processor with an interface\
    \ between sensors, actuators and machine learning tools to\nautomate the cultivation\
    \ process [43]. On the other hand, some proposals consider the use of\nIoT architectures\
    \ for the monitoring and control of devices. Aiming to implement a vertical\n\
    cultivation chamber to care for crops from germination to harvest, Belista et\
    \ al. present\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n7 of 28\nthe design of a vertical cultivation\
    \ chamber distributed in master and slave modules. The\nmaster module controls\
    \ the nutrient containers, the water-cooling system, an evaporative\nfan and a\
    \ power supply, while the slave modules control the pumps that transport the\n\
    nutrients to the crop. The IoT architecture that is presented to manipulate the\
    \ weather\ncontrol systems, the aeroponic irrigation and the mixing chamber for\
    \ nutrients is based on\na central controller, which reads and writes commands\
    \ to acquire information from the\nsensors and thus manipulates the system actuators.\
    \ The information acquired is stored\nlocally, where the user can access the information\
    \ through an application for mobile devices\nthat is linked to the central controller\
    \ through a SAMBA server [44].\nAccording to the literature, there are a wide\
    \ variety of IoT architectures according\nto the functionality and elements that\
    \ each author deﬁnes between communication, the\ndatabase, devices integrated\
    \ into the network, security, services or microservices and their\nrelationship\
    \ with the end user. Similarly, among the various forms of cultivation, the\n\
    variables in common are temperature, humidity, transpiration and luminosity.\n\
    The previously mentioned proposals present connectivity schemes mainly oriented\n\
    to the acquisition of information from climate sensors for weather conditions,\
    \ control of\nactuators for the adjustment of weather conditions and irrigation\
    \ schemes, and user access\nto the systems to supervise the information collected\
    \ and to be able to modify the irrigation\nstrategies; nevertheless, they do not\
    \ contemplate the study of climatic variables for the\nanalysis of the VPD and\
    \ the appearance of water stress.\nTo approach the study of water stress in relation\
    \ to the frequency and time of irrigation,\nas well as the climatic variables\
    \ in the environment and cultivation in a practical way in\naeroponic systems,\
    \ the system proposed in this study integrates features such as crop\ntemperature\
    \ measurement, irrigation programming, automation through microservices,\nthe\
    \ use of a central processor and the integration of a SAMBA server as addressed\
    \ by\nPuengsungwan, Lucero, Loret, Gour and Belista, respectively. However, our\
    \ proposal has\nsensory elements, processing, administration, storage and remote\
    \ access through a 4-layer\nIoT architecture with the ﬂexibility of incorporating\
    \ more sensory elements, processing and\ndecision-making capabilities through\
    \ the fog layer, and system administration functions\nin the user layer for further\
    \ studies to modify the functional structure of the proposed\nIoT architecture.\
    \ The IoT architecture presented consists of an end devices layer, fog layer,\n\
    cloud layer and application layer. Among the main features incorporated in our\
    \ proposal\nare the following:\n1.\nThe grouping of electronic sensors and vision\
    \ systems with end devices.\n2.\nThe administration of end devices through independent\
    \ services for reading sensors,\nand the remote activation of actuators and acquisition\
    \ systems for standard WEB,\nUSB and thermographic cameras using a SAMBA server.\
    \ Additionally, it has an alert\nservice via SMTP in case of failure of the other\
    \ services. All of the above is through\nthe fog layer.\n3.\nA local and cloud\
    \ database. The local database is dedicated to the storage of RGB top,\nside and\
    \ root images, as well as thermographic images in the root. The database in the\n\
    cloud is used for the storage of time-series data generated by the electronic\
    \ sensors, in\naddition to the status of the sensors and actuators, the operating\
    \ status of the services\nof the system, as well as the storage of the last result\
    \ of the image processing.\n4.\nThe implementation of an Android application for\
    \ the manual registration of the vari-\nables related to the nutrient solution,\
    \ environmental conditions, crop yield, historical\ndisplay, data analysis reports,\
    \ as well as the remote acquisition of images, activation\nof actuators and modiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation parameters.\nTable 2 highlights the main characteristics of each\

    The proposed monitoring system is based on a four-layer IoT architecture: device\
    \ layer,\nfog layer, cloud layer and application layer (Figure 3). In Figures\
    \ 1 and 2, the end devices\nincorporated in the device layer of Figure 3 are labeled.\
    \ End device 1 (ED1) integrates the\nsensors used for the measurement of temperature\
    \ and luminosity in the greenhouse, as well\nas with the leaf temperature and\
    \ humidity sensors. End device 2 (ED2) integrates the level\nand temperature sensors\
    \ of the recirculating solution tank, as well as the pump activation\nsystem for\
    \ the stages of irrigation, recirculation and mixing between the recovered nutrient\n\
    solution and that stored in the main tank. End device 3 (ED3) integrates sensors\
    \ for level\nand temperature measurement from the main solution tank. End device\
    \ 4 (ED4) integrates\nthe cameras used for the registration of the growth of the\
    \ crop. Finally, end device 5 (ED5)\nis made up of a thermographic camera and\
    \ a mobile device to send the information to the\nfog layer. The device layer\
    \ consists of ﬁve end devices, ED1, ED2 and ED3 are made up of\nNodeMCU development\
    \ boards based on Web Server, ED4 has a standard USB camera and\nan IP camera,\
    \ both managed by the fog layer through a Raspberry development board, as\nlong\
    \ as the device has a standard USB thermal imager connected to a mobile device\
    \ based\non SMB. The information acquired by each end device is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer.\n \ngreenhouse, as well as with the leaf temperature and humidity\
    \ sensors. End device 2 \n(ED2) integrates the level and temperature sensors of\
    \ the recirculating solution tank, as \nwell as the pump activation system for\
    \ the stages of irrigation, recirculation and mixing \nbetween the recovered nutrient\
    \ solution and that stored in the main tank. End device 3 \n(ED3) integrates sensors\
    \ for level and temperature measurement from the main solution \ntank. End device\
    \ 4 (ED4) integrates the cameras used for the registration of the growth of \n\
    the crop. Finally, end device 5 (ED5) is made up of a thermographic camera and\
    \ a mobile \ndevice to send the information to the fog layer. The device layer\
    \ consists of five end \ndevices, ED1, ED2 and ED3 are made up of NodeMCU development\
    \ boards based on Web \nServer, ED4 has a standard USB camera and an IP camera,\
    \ both managed by the fog layer \nthrough a Raspberry development board, as long\
    \ as the device has a standard USB \nthermal imager connected to a mobile device\
    \ based on SMB. The information acquired by \neach end device is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer. \nThe fog layer is made up of a set of microservices in charge\
    \ of managing the \ninformation locally or remotely through one of several servers\
    \ in the cloud. Locally, 4 \nservices are executed independently: irrigation service\
    \ in charge of turning the sprinkler \nsystem on and off according to the irrigation\
    \ frequency and the day and night switch-on \ntime programmed by the user; reservoir\
    \ service responsible for monitoring the level of \nthe secondary tank and generating\
    \ the recirculation of the nutrient solution to the main \ntank; the camera service\
    \ in charge of taking screenshots of the plant from the side and top \nview according\
    \ to the schedule programmed by the user, generating a local database; \nlikewise,\
    \ it is in charge of processing the images coming from all the cameras installed\
    \ in \nthe system; CV-GUI Services, the remote user interface used to manage system\
    \ settings \nand status. \n \nFigure 3. IoT architecture of the monitoring system.\
    \ \nOn the other hand, the sensor service, control service and alert service microservices\
    \ \nmanage the exchange of information between the sensors, local microservices\
    \ and the \nFigure 3. IoT architecture of the monitoring system.\nThe fog layer\
    \ is made up of a set of microservices in charge of managing the informa-\ntion\
    \ locally or remotely through one of several servers in the cloud. Locally, 4\
    \ services are\nexecuted independently: irrigation service in charge of turning\
    \ the sprinkler system on and\noff according to the irrigation frequency and the\
    \ day and night switch-on time programmed\nby the user; reservoir service responsible\
    \ for monitoring the level of the secondary tank and\ngenerating the recirculation\
    \ of the nutrient solution to the main tank; the camera service\nin charge of\
    \ taking screenshots of the plant from the side and top view according to the\n\
    schedule programmed by the user, generating a local database; likewise, it is\
    \ in charge\nof processing the images coming from all the cameras installed in\
    \ the system; CV-GUI\nServices, the remote user interface used to manage system\
    \ settings and status.\nOn the other hand, the sensor service, control service\
    \ and alert service microservices\nmanage the exchange of information between\
    \ the sensors, local microservices and the\nThingspeak server. The sensor service\
    \ is responsible for collecting information from each\none of the sensors of the\
    \ environmental variables, the nutrient solution, as well as the state\nof execution\
    \ of the irrigation systems, the recirculation of the nutrient solution and the\n\
    activating of the cameras installed to upload the data to the cloud. The control\
    \ service\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n11 of 28\nhas the function of scanning the\
    \ server’s control data channel before the start of new\nconﬁgurations for the\
    \ irrigation system and the camera system, as well as the remote\nactivation of\
    \ the sprinkler nozzles, the recirculating stage and the nutrient solution mixer.\n\
    The alert services are in charge of monitoring the operation of all the services;\
    \ in case one of\nthem is interrupted by a failure, it sends an alert via SMTP.\
    \ In addition to the microservices,\nthe fog layer integrates an SMB server, which\
    \ allows connectivity between the standard\nthermographic camera and the image\
    \ database through its USB connection to an Android,\nWindows or Linux device,\
    \ and this in turn as an SMB user.\nThe cloud layer is made up of the data storage\
    \ and analytics services built into the\nThingspeak and Firebase platforms. Thingspeak\
    \ is used as a database with a time-series\nformat, as well as for data analysis\
    \ and visualization of results through its IoT analytics\ntools. For this investigation,\
    \ four Thingspeak channels are used for: the administration of\nthe variables\
    \ of the environmental temperature, the temperature in the leaf, the relative\n\
    humidity in the environment and the leaf, the level and the temperature of the\
    \ recirculation\ndeposit, as well as light intensity (environmental measurements\
    \ channel); administration of\nthe variables related to the level and temperature\
    \ of the main nutrient solution tank and the\noperating status of the chambers,\
    \ the irrigation system and the recirculating stage (services\nchannel); storage\
    \ of variables ambient temperature, relative humidity, crop temperature,\npH,\
    \ EC, fresh weight, length and width of the lettuce leaf, all of them implemented\
    \ manually\nusing standard instruments and recorded through the app generated\
    \ in this study (manual\nmeasurements channel); management of requests from the\
    \ end user to download or update\nadministration of requests for the irrigation\
    \ times and camera triggers, as well as remotely\nactivating the irrigation system,\
    \ the recirculating stage as well as the nutrient solution\nmixer (control channel).\
    \ Firebase, on the other hand, has a real-time database stored in\nJSON format,\
    \ as well as a database for ﬁle storage. The use of Firebase is intended for the\n\
    conﬁguration of the parameters for the processing of the images, as well as the\
    \ storage\nof the images processed by the fog layer, allowing the platform to\
    \ request speciﬁc image\nprocessing services between the application developed\
    \ in this research and the fog layer.\nFinally, the application layer is an Android\
    \ app called “Aeroponics Monitor”, which,\nthrough HTTP requests, makes requests\
    \ to the Thingspeak server for the generation of\ncomparative or analytical reports\
    \ between variables, performance reports of installed\nsensors and communication\
    \ with the platform, historical data by variable, access to the\nconﬁguration\
    \ of the irrigation systems and the triggering of the image capture devices as\n\
    well as the manual control of actuators through remote access, the measurement\
    \ of the\ncultivation parameters and the registration of the amount of nitric\
    \ acid and solution A and\nB dissolved in the nutrient solution to readjust the\
    \ pH and EC ranges. Likewise, it has\naccess through Firebase to the latest results\
    \ of the processing of the images generated by\nthe fog layer.\n3.3. Aeroponics\
    \ Monitor App\nThe Aeroponics Monitor is an application developed at Android Studio\
    \ and registered\nin INDAUTOR Mexico under the registration number 03-201-10514230-01;\
    \ this application\nis operated by users to visualize the behavior of the variables\
    \ and the operating status of\nthe system, and control the actions of the aeroponic\
    \ system actuators in a remote way. The\nAeroponics Monitor contains eight main\
    \ windows: the home window (Figure 4a), which\nallows a quick view of the status\
    \ of the environmental variables of the culture system,\naccessing through a menu\
    \ section of reports, records, conﬁgurations, manual controls,\nmanual measurements,\
    \ manual readjustment and image analysis. Each one of them is\ndescribed below.\n\

    \ variables of the aeroponic system individ-\nually, showing an analysis of the\
    \ data stored for one hour, 12 h, one day and up to three\ndays by making an HTTP\
    \ request to the server. Among the variables monitored in this\nsection are the\
    \ temperature of the nutrient solution, the environmental temperature, the\ncrop\
    \ temperature, the relative humidity of the environment, the relative humidity\
    \ of the\ncrop, luminosity, temperature of the recirculation tank and level of\
    \ the recirculation tank\n(Figure 4c).\n3.3.3. Settings Window\nThe settings window\
    \ gives users access to modify the parameters for activation of the\nimage acquisition\
    \ system, as well as the frequency and time of ignition (day/night) of the\nirrigation\
    \ system (Figure 4d).\n3.3.4. Manual Controls Window\nThe window for manual controls\
    \ allows a link to be established remotely with the\nirrigation system. Its operation\
    \ is based on downloading the latest state of each actuator to\nshow it on the\
    \ app’s switches, as well as updating each state when the “SEND” button is\npressed,\
    \ so that the control service executes the orders in the greenhouse (Figure 4e).\n\
    3.3.5. Manual Measurements Window\nThrough this window, the user makes a manual\
    \ record of the evolution of crop\nparameters, such as fresh weight, length, width\
    \ and temperature of the lettuce leaf; the\nevolution of the environmental variables\
    \ considering the temperature and the relative\nhumidity in the environment; the\
    \ evolution of the parameters in the nutritive solution\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n\
    14 of 28\nconsidering the pH and EC. All these parameters are stored in the server\
    \ for the generation\nof the record and reports (Figure 4f).\n3.3.6. Manual Readjust\
    \ Window\nThe manual readjust window allows the user to check the temperature\
    \ and level of\neach tank in the aeroponic system, as well as a quick reading\
    \ of the latest pH and EC value\n(Figure 4g). To readjust the pH and EC value,\
    \ the total evacuation of the recirculation tank\nmust be considered through the\
    \ manual control window to later read the number of liters\nin the main tank and\
    \ record the amount of nitric acid used to lower the pH, as well as\nthe amount\
    \ of solution A and B to compensate for the quantity of salts dissolved in the\n\
    nutrient solution.\n3.3.7. Image Analysis Window\nThe image analysis window allows\
    \ viewing the latest data capture taken by the image\nacquisition systems of the\
    \ monitoring system. Among the results that allow visualization\nof the platform\
    \ are the lateral image, the upper image, the processing of the leaf area index\n\
    (LAI), as well as the latest RGB images and IR of leaf and root obtained by the\
    \ thermal\ncamera (Figure 4h).\n3.4. Data Management\nAmong the main challenges\
    \ faced in IoT applications are data ofﬂoading, heterogeneity\nand big data [45].\
    \ To reduce the latency between the IoT sensors described in the proposal\nand\
    \ the Thingspeak server, sensor service makes consecutive requests via HTTP protocol\
    \ to\neach of the end devices, collecting and grouping the information, from climate\
    \ and nutrient\nsolution sensors, in a single package and registering it on the\
    \ server. Between each request\nfrom sensor service to server, 30 s waiting interval\
    \ is taken.\nTo address the heterogeneity of the data, sensor service operates\
    \ sequentially, while the\nservices oriented towards image capture and irrigation\
    \ and recirculation services operate\nin parallel through the camera service,\
    \ irrigation service and reservoir service, respectively.\nEach service in operation\
    \ generates a binary log ﬁle (npy ﬁle), storing the latest state of\nsensors and\
    \ actuators, through which it shares the information with other services running\n\
    on the fog layer.\nRegarding the amount of data that can be generated between\
    \ numerical records and\nimages through IoT devices, numerical records are stored\
    \ in Thingspeak with a maximum\nof 2880 requests per day out of 8200 possible,\
    \ while the image records from the side and\nupper view of the plant are directly\
    \ stored in the SD memory on the fog layer. The number\nof images generated depends\
    \ on times scheduled for image acquisition (9/day/camera in\nthis experiment).\n\
    3.5. Remote Operation\nRemote operation of the aeroponic system is achieved from\
    \ reading (continuous) and\nwriting (on demand) of the control’s data channel\
    \ (command vector), which hosts the latest\nstatus of the system’s irrigation,\
    \ recirculation and mixer actuators, as well as the command\nstates that trigger\
    \ the image capture system, writing or reading of conﬁgurations referring\nto\
    \ the interval and frequency of irrigation (Figure 5). Each of these states is\
    \ encoded and\ndecoded in the communication process between fog layer and the\
    \ app.\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n15 of 28\n \ng (\n)\n(\n)\nlatest status of the\
    \ system’s irrigation, recirculation and mixer actuators, as well as \ncommand\
    \ states that trigger the image capture system, writing or reading \nconfigurations\
    \ referring to the interval and frequency of irrigation (Figure 5). Each of th\n\
    states is encoded and decoded in the communication process between fog layer and\
    \ \napp. \n \nFigure 5. Command vector for remote operation from App. \nFigure\
    \ 5. Command vector for remote operation from App.\nCommand vector is a message\
    \ encoded in 10 bits, a bit for the activation or deactivation\n(1 or 0) of any\
    \ actuator or service hosted in the fog layer, followed by a status bit to detect\
    \ if\nthe request has been attended or not (1 or 0) by the fog layer, ending with\
    \ a parity bit to avoid\nerrors in the communication between the app and fog layer.\
    \ Response messages between\nthe communication are stored in numerical form in\
    \ Thingspeak control’s data channel.\n3.6. Cost of Using the Platform\nTo establish\
    \ the minimum operating conditions of the proposed architecture, free\nlicenses\
    \ for Thingspeak and Firebase servers are used. Thingspeak under a free license\n\
    allows a message limit of approximately 3 million/year or 8200 messages/day with\
    \ an\nupdate rate of 15 s. Likewise, it allows us to use 4 channels with 8 ﬁelds\
    \ for numerical data.\nCurrently, the development of this work requires 27 of\
    \ the 32 available ﬁelds. In case of\nrequiring more ﬁelds than assigned, a student,\
    \ home, standard or academic license can be\nobtained, specifying the number of\
    \ channels and update rate (1 s as minimum) with a cost\nfrom USD 79.00 for 33\
    \ million/year/units [46]. Among the services offered by Firebase\nsubscription\
    \ are real-time database and cloud storage, which are used in this project in\n\
    its free mode (Spark) to store the most recent results of image processing according\
    \ to\nthe schedule assigned by camera service or downloading them by request from\
    \ the app.\nFirebase in these services allows storage of 1 GB and 5 GB, respectively.\
    \ In the case of the\nreal-time database, it allows downloads of up to 10 GB/month\
    \ and in the case of cloud\nstorage a bandwidth of 1 GB/day. For higher storage,\
    \ bandwidth or additional features,\nFirebase offers a pay as you go (Blaze) plan\
    \ and a cost calculator in its website [47].\n3.7. Improvements Using a Fog Layer\n\
    In cloud-based IoT environments, latency is often high due to the distance between\n\
    IoT devices and the cloud, this increases cloud response time. As the number of\
    \ IoT devices\nincreases, the cloud cannot support the real-time demands of these\
    \ [48]. According to\nThingspeak, for each write request attended, a message is\
    \ consumed [49]. By using a\nfog layer in our proposal, it allows grouping the\
    \ information in packets of 8 numerical\ndata, uploading them to the server using\
    \ only a single request per channel. This involves\nhandling writing to the server\
    \ of up to 32 numeric variables with a single wait interval. On\nthe other hand,\
    \ Firebase has the Firebase ML service, which has models with the ability to\n\
    recognize text, image labeling, object detection and tracking, among others; however,\
    \ it is\nlimited to the use of TensorFlow Lite models [50]. Using a fog layer\
    \ as a central processing\nelement allows the execution of multiple vision algorithms\
    \ without dependence on external\nservice or additional usage cost. In consideration\
    \ of the use of Firebase only as storage for\nimage processing results, the bandwidth\
    \ used to download data from the server to the app\nimplies only 150.05 kB/request/user.\n\

    \ is performed between the image segmented in\nV and the negative of that segmented\
    \ in H to pass them through morphological ﬁltering\nwith a 2 × 2 kernel, obtaining\

    \ scheme are the temperature and relative humidity in the environment, and the\n\
    programmed irrigation schemes based on frequency and the ignition time. Particularly\
    \ in\naeroponics, between the schemes recently used are the variation in atomization\
    \ times of\nday/night according to the days of production and the time interval\
    \ when the ambient\ntemperature exceeds 35 ◦C [14], as well as the control of\
    \ the temperature and humidity in\nthe root chamber between 25 and 29 ◦C [40];\
    \ however, they do not consider the standard\nmarkers of crop water needs such\
    \ as the crop temperature, VPD or water stress index.\nIn the present paper, a\
    \ Batavia lettuce seedling was subjected to observation in the\naeroponic cultivation\
    \ chamber from its transplant, preserving the ranges of pH and EC\nbetween 5.5\
    \ and 6.5 and 750 and 1100 ppm and with a constant irrigation system every\n24\
    \ min day/night with an activation time of 30 s. According to the experimental\
    \ results,\nthe DTla does not provide a speciﬁc criterion for the determination\
    \ of water stress in\nan aeroponic crop; more studies are required on the Batavia\
    \ lettuce variety to estimate\nthe temperature ranges where the DTla serve as\
    \ a concrete marker of water stress. The\nexperimentation in the crop camera that\
    \ was presented shows how the VPD from the\nbeginning marked a potential root\
    \ damage due to water stress. Figure 9 illustrates how a\ntemperature between\
    \ 10 and 20 ◦C together with a relative humidity above 35% favors the\nreduction\
    \ in the VPD. Figure 16 shows, in relation to the fresh weight, an increase in\
    \ VPD\nreduction. Figure 16 shows, in relation to the fresh weight, a consistent\
    \ increase; however,\nthe leaf size presented a reduction in the rate of growth\
    \ from the ﬁrst week.\nThe estimation of the VPD in conjunction with image processing\
    \ provides an estimate\nof the appearance and evolution of water stress in aeroponic\
    \ crops. Among the main actions\nto evaluate against a high VPD and the reduction\
    \ in the rate of growth of the leaf, is the\nincrease in the frequency of irrigation,\
    \ as well as the incorporation of a system that allows\nthe control of external\
    \ environmental parameters.\nIn the literature studied, both conceptual and practices\
    \ in the development of crops in\nthe soil, hydroponics and aeroponics, address\
    \ the grouping schemes of components that\nmake up the stages and connectivity\
    \ of an IoT architecture.\nAccording to the practical proposals found in the literature,\
    \ by using IoT-based tech-\nnologies to manage irrigation conditions and proposals\
    \ related to aeroponics, in comparison\nwith our proposal, the following were\
    \ found: similarities between layers using IoT architec-\nture and functionalities\
    \ using functional blocks addressed by Boursianis, Roy and Lloret;\ncommon study\
    \ variables addressed by Lucero, Jamhari and Belista. According to this\ncriterion,\
    \ the differences are highlighted in Table 5.\nAs shown, most of the systems consider\
    \ the measurement of environmental variables\nand, depending on the meteorological\
    \ data of the case to determine the irrigation and\nmonitoring needs, the automated\
    \ monitoring of the nutritional conditions of the nutritive\nsolution. However,\
    \ the previous studies do not consider the monitoring of crop growth\nfrom image\
    \ acquisition and analysis systems, nor do they include reports and alerts due\
    \ to\nthe failure of the electronic systems used in the proposal. In the proposal\
    \ that is presented\nin this paper, there is an application that not only accesses\
    \ the monitored data regarding the\ncrop, but also provides information on the\
    \ functionality status of the incorporated electronic\nsystems, allowing the user\
    \ to be alert to the maintenance needs of electronic elements and\nsoftware incorporated\
    \ in the IoT architecture that has been presented. This proposal does\nnot yet\
    \ incorporate the temperature control and humidity in the greenhouse; however,\n\
    the architecture developed presents the ﬂexibility to incorporate additional monitoring\n\
    services and control due to the inclusion of a fog node in the proposed IoT architecture.\n\

    \ and Further Studies\nThis article presents an IoT architecture that facilitates\
    \ the management of an aeroponic\ngreenhouse through the registration of manual\
    \ procedures, the automation of the irrigation\nsystem and the monitoring of environmental\
    \ variables in cultivation; all this with the\nsupport of a visualization tool\
    \ from an app.\nThe estimation of the VPD indicates the appearance of water stress\
    \ due to the insufﬁ-\ncient absorption of crop water. This suggests the importance\
    \ of making an adaptation to\nthe atomization times and the intervals of the times\
    \ of irrigation, as well as the cooling and\nventilation systems.\nThe main contribution\
    \ of this paper is the integration of smart sensors, in a techno-\nlogical solution\
    \ based on IoT, that allows the study of the favorable conditions for the\ngrowth\
    \ of aeroponic crops with remote management. The app developed for this purpose\n\
    allows the visualization of historical variables of temperature and relative humidity\
    \ in\nthe environment and crops, VPD and luminosity, as well as the level and\
    \ temperature\nof the nutrient solution tanks to carry out the adjustment of pH\
    \ and EC. The proposed\narchitecture allows the incorporation of monitoring and\
    \ image processing systems that\nwill enrich the studies of the thermography and\
    \ morphology of the aeroponic crops for\nroots and leaves. Additionally, the proposed\
    \ architecture manages the heterogeneity of\ndata through microservices and allows\
    \ us to reduce latency in the communication with the\nserver using, as a basis,\
    \ a waiting interval time of 30 s between each writing of data on the\nserver,\
    \ as well as by using a reduced bandwidth to view the results of image processing\n\
    remotely, by a request to the server and downloading it from the app.\nThe use\
    \ of the proposed architecture will allow the study of the variation in irrigation\n\
    schemes based on markers such as VPD, CWSI and DTla, favoring the rapid adaptation\
    \ of\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n26 of 28\nirrigation strategies to produce crops\
    \ with a higher number of leaves, leaf area index and\nfresh weight among others.\n\
    As future work, the proposed architecture for aeroponic crop production will be\
    \ imple-\nmented, monitoring the growth chambers simultaneously, and considering\
    \ the irrigation\nfrequency and the time interval as study variables, as well\
    \ as the decrease in VPD in the\naeroponic crop process. With regard to the image\
    \ processing-embedded algorithms on fog\nlayer, for the study of colorimetry,\
    \ infrared thermography and morphology in the evolution\nof the crop when considering\
    \ the leaf and root will be added.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.A.M.-G.\

    \ in population and the reliance on water as a key input for\nagricultural production,\
    \ greater demand will be placed on freshwater supplies. The objective of\nthis\
    \ work was to present the newly developed Android smartphone application to calculate\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration in real-time to support ﬁeld-scale irrigation management.\
    \ As part of the answer\nto water shortage, we embraced technology by developing\
    \ AgSAT, a Google Earth Engine-based\napplication that optimizes water use for\
    \ food production. AgSAT uses meteorological data to calculate\ndaily water requirements\
    \ using the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method (ETref) and vegetation indices\nfrom satellite\
    \ imagery to derive the basal crop growth coefﬁcient, Kcb. The performance of\
    \ AgSAT\nto estimate ETref was assessed using climatic data from 18 meteorological\
    \ stations distributed over\nseveral climatic zones worldwide. ETref estimation\
    \ through the app showed acceptable results with\nvalues of 1.27, 0.9, 0.79, 0.95,\
    \ and 0.5 for root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefﬁcient (r),\nmodeling\
    \ efﬁciency (NSE), concordance index (d), and percentage bias (Pbias), respectively.\
    \ AgSAT\nguides gross irrigation requirements for crops and rationalizes water\
    \ quantities used in agricultural\nproduction. AgSAT has been released, is currently\
    \ in use by research scientists, agricultural producers,\nand irrigation managers,\
    \ and is freely accessible from the Google Play and IOS Store and also at\nagsat.app.\
    \ Our work is geared towards the development of remote sensing-based technologies\
    \ that\ntransfer signiﬁcant beneﬁts to farmers and water-saving efforts.\nKeywords:\

    \ resources available worldwide are exclusively used for\nirrigation purposes\
    \ [1]. Smartly managing these freshwater resources for precision irriga-\ntion\
    \ in agriculture is essential for enhancing crop yield and water productivity,\
    \ improving\nirrigation scheduling, and decreasing farming costs while sustaining\
    \ the environment [2–7].\nSmart irrigation scheduling has evolved from computer-based\
    \ tools and programs such as\nCROPWAT [8], consumptive use program (CUP) [9],\
    \ and Washington Irrigation Scheduling\nExpert (WISE) [10], to recently incorporate\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT emerged as\nthe means for smart water\
    \ management applications by offering easy-to-use methods and\nreal-time scheduling\
    \ regarding water availability, crop water requirements, soil and weather\nconditions,\
    \ and crop response to stress. In this context, a shift from traditional irrigation\n\
    methods to real-time smart irrigation automation using low-cost sensors, weather\
    \ data, and\nwater balance or evapotranspiration modeling approaches is now gaining\
    \ attention [11].\nMany researchers reported using internet and communication\
    \ tools (ICT) in irrigation\napplications [12,13]. ICT include cloud-based technologies\
    \ for data acquisition transmission\nand management, soil–plant–atmosphere and\
    \ irrigation performance monitoring, and\nremote control of the irrigation process\
    \ [14]. The literature shows a plethora of applications\nof ICT in irrigation\
    \ systems at the irrigation district-scale including using remote sensing,\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 5090. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14205090\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n2 of 22\ncrop modeling, linear regressions, and neural\
    \ approaches for water demand forecast,\nand remote control of irrigation processes\
    \ (see, for example, Bartlett et al. [15]; Sesma\net al. [16], Pulido-Calvo et\
    \ al. [17]). Perea et al. [18] established an ICT-based system for\nscheduling\
    \ and managing irrigation at the micro-scale level (i.e., a strawberry farm),\
    \ using\nthe principles of precision irrigation. However, many of these tools\
    \ remain within the realm\nof research institutions, and few reach out to farmers\
    \ for direct ﬁeld applications, leaving\nthem with limited on-farm technology\
    \ access and with reliance on traditional irrigation\nscheduling methods that\
    \ often reduce yield and water productivity.\nThere is also growing attention\
    \ towards the development of web and software-based\nirrigation scheduling tools\
    \ for estimating site-speciﬁc water requirements at various scales,\nwhich has\
    \ better chances of farmer’s accessibility. One of the most signiﬁcant advantages\
    \ of\nusing smartphone applications is that they represent instances of portable\
    \ and simple-to-use\ntechnology, allowing for real-time decision-making. Some\
    \ of these tools integrate real-time\nweather data with crop-speciﬁc ET or water\
    \ budgeting methods [19–21]. Some web-based\napplications have also been developed,\
    \ such as Wateright [22], and Crop Manage [23].\nMoreover, several public agencies\
    \ have developed online irrigation scheduling services,\nincluding IRRINET in\
    \ Italy [24], IrriSatSMS [25] in Australia, IRRISA in France [26], and\nISS-ITAP\
    \ in Spain [27].\nAlthough the earlier mentioned irrigation scheduling systems’\
    \ (e.g., ICs, sensors, web\nplatforms, apps, and online irrigation services) costs\
    \ are generally falling, for growers of\nmoderate- to low-proﬁt crops, this technology\
    \ may still be cost-unaffordable if it does\nnot signiﬁcantly increase farmer\
    \ income [28]. In addition, the computerized irrigation\ntechnologies have limited\
    \ on-ﬁeld applicability due to the need for desktop computers,\nwhich represents\
    \ one other signiﬁcant barrier that hampers their adoption by farmers.\nSuch web-based\
    \ tools may have limited user interaction and rely heavily on frequent user-\n\
    follow up using a laptop or desktop computer. Farmers readily adopt simple technologies\n\
    that require limited knowledge and skills, such as auto-steer machinery, irrigation\
    \ pivots,\nsprinklers, and others. However, the implementation of information-intensive\
    \ technologies\nis often limited. These innovations may require further investments\
    \ in hiring external\nservices to train farmers [29–31]. While the available literature\
    \ has tended to focus on major\nadvancements in smart irrigation applications,\
    \ many agricultural regions in the world\nlack the availability of the above technologies.\
    \ Less-skilled farmers in countries where\nagriculture is viewed as a chief economic\
    \ sector are often held back from the potential\nadoption of such technologies.\n\
    The increased use of smartphones, combined with weather data availability, has\
    \ cre-\nated an excellent environment for developing and deploying smartphone\
    \ applications for\ncalculating crop water requirements in near real-time. Several\
    \ smart irrigation mobile apps\nwere designed using this approach. In contrast\
    \ to web-based tools, smartphone applications\nprovide increased operational ﬂexibility,\
    \ simplicity in control, and continuous user–tool\ninteraction. Smart Irrigation\
    \ apps (for example, those developed by the Universities of\nFlorida and Georgia)\
    \ may offer real-time irrigation schedules for commercially valuable\nseasonal\
    \ and perennial selected crops, including strawberry, avocado, citrus, peanut,\
    \ cot-\nton, and vegetables. The irrigation schedule is based on the integration\
    \ of weather and\nshort-term forecasted data with crop evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ or water balance approach.\nSuch apps are customized according to the users’\
    \ practices in terms of the used irrigation\nsystems, splitting irrigation events,\
    \ water conservation options, and other management\nmethods. While the limitation\
    \ of these apps is the spatial variability of rainfall, their vali-\ndation over\
    \ multiple seasons at ﬁeld level in water savings for lawn, tomato, and citrus\n\
    are 57, 33, and 24%, respectively [18,32,33]. Blueleaf is another example of a\
    \ smartphone\napplication developed in partnership with IAM (Institut Agronomique\
    \ Méditerannéen) of\nBari (Italy), the CNR of Italy, and a consortium of Italian\
    \ enterprises [12]. Daily soil-water\nbalance is modeled based on station weather\
    \ data, and farmers need to add a range of\nrequired information into the application\
    \ and install a soil moisture probe, making the\napp laborious to use. Another\
    \ example of smartphone apps with similar capabilities is\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 5090\n3 of 22\nthe Colorado State University WISE Irrigation Scheduler [15].\
    \ Recently, the EVAPO app\nwas developed that provides reference point ET data\
    \ based on the NASA-POWER system.\nHowever, the grid size of the weather data\
    \ has a spatial resolution of 1 × 1◦, or 12347 km2\n(111.12 × 111.12 km) at the\
    \ equator [34].\nEvapotranspiration is a key parameter for hydrological and climatological\
    \ studies,\nas well as for agricultural water resources management, such as irrigation\
    \ management\nand planning. Several empirical methods to estimate reference evapotranspiration\
    \ have\nbeen developed in the past 50 years, with the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method\
    \ being the\nmost accurate one under different climatic conditions [35]. The availability\
    \ of high spatial\nresolutions of satellite imagery that is publicly available\
    \ nowadays (such as the Sentinel-2\nimagery from the Copernicus mission of the\
    \ European Space Agency) and the long period\nof records of Landsat imagery provides\
    \ opportunities to develop operational and global\nevapotranspiration (ET) datasets\
    \ at ﬁeld scales [36]. Our innovation avoids scalability\nlimitations and diverts\
    \ from the availability of on-farm weather stations and soil sensors.\nWe developed\
    \ the ﬁrst global smart irrigation application (AgSAT), that relies on\nremote\
    \ sensing and gridded global weather data forecasts and, as such, has near real-\n\
    time operational capability. The application was released to the Google Play store\
    \ in\nEnglish and Arabic. The app performs on-demand satellite and climate data\
    \ processing\nthrough Google’s Earth Engine-enabling environment. It provides\
    \ crop water requirements\nbased on crop growth coefﬁcients derived from remotely\
    \ sensed vegetation indices at a\nresolution of 10m and based on reference evapotranspiration\
    \ calculated every six hours and\npopulated to the daily interval from the coupled\
    \ rorecast system model version 2 (CFSV2).\nThe objectives of this study were\
    \ to (1) provide a general overview of the AgSAT app,\n(2) evaluate the remote-sensing-based\
    \ approach for calculating ETref through comparison\nagainst meteorological data\
    \ collected from 18 weather stations at various locations in\ndifferent climatic\
    \ regions and temporal scales (daily and monthly), and (3) asses the\nremotely\
    \ sensed estimates of ETref and Kc at plot scale over an irrigated potato ﬁeld,\n\
    located in Lebanon at the Agriculture Research and Education Center (AREC) during\n\
    the growing season of 12 March–15 July 2020. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate\
    \ the\noperational application of AgSAT to monitor irrigation water use at the\
    \ ﬁeld level and\nglobal scales.\n2. AgSAT App Conceptual Framework\n2.1. Model\
    \ Overview: Crop Water Requirement Based on FAO 56 Approach\nSeveral studies have\
    \ reported that the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) model,\nwhich has been tested\
    \ in many regions of the world, is renowned for being the most\naccurate under\
    \ different climatic conditions [35]. The model for crop water requirements\n\
    used in the AgSAT app is based on the FAO-56 approach. We provided, herein, a\
    \ brief\ndescription of the main calculations. The FAO-56 is based on the concept\
    \ of reference\nevapotranspiration for standard, well-watered crops by crop coefﬁcients\
    \ to account for the\ninﬂuences of ET during the growing season. Therefore, the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration\nis estimated as follows:\nET = Kcb × ETre f\n\
    (1)\nwhere ET is the actual evapotranspiration, Kcb is the basal crop coefﬁcient,\
    \ and ETref is the\nreference evapotranspiration.\nAgSAT calculates the ASCE Standardized\
    \ Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration prod-\nuct (ETref) using the 6 h CFSV2 gridded\
    \ (0.2 arc degrees) weather dataset available in\nGoogle Earth Engine data generated\
    \ by the National Centers for Environmental Predic-\ntion (NCEP) of the National\
    \ Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [36]. The\nCFSV2 version 2 was\
    \ developed at the Environmental Modeling Center at NCEP. CFSV2 is\na fully coupled\
    \ model representing the interaction between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans,\n\
    land, and sea ice. Currently, CFSV2 is the global weather reanalysis and forecast\
    \ with the\nhighest temporal and spatial resolution to allow for real-time reference\
    \ evapotranspiration\ncalculations and forecasts on Google Earth Engine. Other\
    \ available datasets or systems\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n4 of 22\n(e.g.,\
    \ GLDAS, NASA-POWER, ECMWF) are either unavailable in near real-time unless\n\
    paid for or have a lower resolution. Each grid of the CFSV2 ﬁle covers an approximate\
    \ area\nof 490 km2. We used the weather variables in Table 1 for deriving ETref\
    \ after adjusting the\nwind-speed to 2 m height. In the ASCE-Penman–Monteith equation,\
    \ the surface resistance\nrs is computed from the leaf area index (LAI), which\
    \ is a function of the height speciﬁed\nfor the reference type, usually either\
    \ grass or alfalfa. Algorithms for LAI depend on the\nreference type. Therefore,\
    \ the value of rs (and the aerodynamic resistance ra) will change\nwith the height\
    \ speciﬁed for the reference. Based on the ASCE LAI algorithms, the values\nfor\
    \ rs for 24-hour time steps are rs = 70 s m−1 for 0.12 m tall grass and rs = 45\
    \ s m−1 for 0.5 m\ntall alfalfa. Because the Penman–Monteith equation is well-documented\
    \ in the scientiﬁc\nliterature, we did not repeat its presentation in this paper.\n\

    \ crop coefﬁcient (Kcb) is a major variable determining crop transpiration, and\n\
    its estimation is necessary to determine crop water use. Crop coefﬁcients have\
    \ been shown\nto correlate well with satellite-based vegetation indices, making\
    \ their remote estimation\nfrom operational platforms practical [37–39]. The normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index\n(NDVI) and other vegetation indices such as the\
    \ soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and\nthe enhanced vegetation index (EVI)\
    \ have been used as the main operational parameters to\nmonitor vegetation status\
    \ using Earth Observation. These indices rely on the difference\nin reﬂectance\
    \ of vegetation (between the near-infrared band heavily reﬂected by healthy\n\
    vegetation and the red-band absorbed for photosynthesis). In 2015, the Copernicus\
    \ ESA\nmission made available the highest resolution (10 m) remotely sensed satellite\
    \ imagery\nfrom the Sentinel-2 satellite. Sentinel-2 is now available at 5-day\
    \ revisit time, making\nits utilization in vegetation monitoring helpful. We utilized\
    \ the red (Band 4) and the\nnear-infrared band (Band 8A) of Sentinel-2 to derive\
    \ the normalized difference vegetation\nindex and the soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI). Several researchers have provided\nempirical equations to derive\
    \ the crop coefﬁcients from the NDVI and SAVI [38,40–43].\nKamble, Kilic, and\
    \ Hubbard [38] developed a simple linear regression model between Kcb\ncalculated\
    \ from the ﬂux data measured for different crops and cropping practices using\n\
    AmeriFlux towers and MODIS NDVI. We adopted equations from the literature to derive\n\
    Kcb according to crop type (Table A1). We used a generic equation to calculate\
    \ the crop\ncoefﬁcient surrogate for crops that do not have a corresponding NDVI–Kcb\
    \ relationship.\nFirst, NDVI is transformed into a fractional vegetative cover\
    \ (Fc) via empirical relationships\ndeveloped by USDA and NASA [37] as follows:\n\
    Fc = 1.26 × NDVI − 0.18\n(2)\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n5 of 22\nKcb is determined\
    \ using the generic equation as established by Melton et al. [44]\nfollowing methods\
    \ described by Allen and Pereira [45]:\nKcb = −0.4766 × F2\nc + 1.4048 × Fc +\
    \ 0.15\n(3)\nFor the derived NDVI/SAVI at 10 m, we masked out pixels of cloud\

    \ the latest available image\nfor masked pixels to a daily time step. The interpolated\
    \ NDVI/SAVI were then used to\ncalculate the crop growth coefﬁcient. Finally,\
    \ the crop coefﬁcient is multiplied by the daily\nreference evapotranspiration\
    \ for the ﬁeld location as calculated from the gridded weather\ndata and forecasts\
    \ for that location.\nTo calculate irrigation requirements, we prompt the user\
    \ to input the on-farm irrigation\nsystem, from which an irrigation efﬁciency\
    \ can be assumed (Table 2), based on [46].\nTable 2. Suggested irrigation efﬁciencies\

    80%\nSurface\nN/A\nIrrigation efﬁciencies are used to calculate the gross irrigation\
    \ requirement only if\nthe user delineates the ﬁeld area (gross irrigation requirement=\
    \ (net irrigation require-\nment/irrigation efﬁciency) * Area, where net irrigation\
    \ requirement is the actual crop water\nrequirements calculated with an assumption\
    \ of zero rainfall). Hence, gross water irrigation\nrequirements are provided\
    \ under dry weather conditions. Once the user selects the valve\nsize irrigating\
    \ the ﬁeld, run-times (run time = total irrigation requirement/ discharge of\n\
    the water pump) are calculated from ﬂow rates assuming design water ﬂow velocity\
    \ in\nclosed pipes of 1.5 m/s (which is recommended for ﬂow in pressurized closed\
    \ conduits).\nRun-times are not calculated for surface irrigation systems and\
    \ only refer to the total dura-\ntion of irrigation needed for the ﬁeld given\
    \ the system type, the ﬁeld area, and the valve\nsize (main or submain pipe size\
    \ irrigating the ﬁeld). No leaching requirement is included\nin adjusting the\
    \ run-time values, and it is assumed that the irrigation efﬁciencies will\nhandle\
    \ necessary leaching, except for saline soils or irrigation water. AgSAT also\
    \ provides\na ﬁve-day irrigation volume requirement should the user decide to\
    \ lump irrigations every\nﬁve days in case the maximum available water in the\
    \ root zone permits (applicable in\nalmost all soils expect sandy soils and shallow\

    3. AgSAT ETref Performance Analyses\n3.1. Direct Validation of AgSAT ETref against\
    \ ETref from Various Weather Stations Worldwide\nTo evaluate the performance of\
    \ AgSAT, we compared ETref estimated by the AgSAT\nwith the ETref calculated from\
    \ meteorological data collected from 18 weather stations at\nvarious locations\
    \ in different climatic regions worldwide (USA, South America, Europe,\nAfrica,\
    \ Asia) (Figure 3). The daily station ETref equation was calculated using the\
    \ REF-\nET software of the University of Idaho. The agrometeorological data used\
    \ from weather\nstations were temperature (◦C), solar radiation (W m−2), and wind\
    \ speed (m s−1). Some\nweather networks included hourly minimum and maximum temperatures.\
    \ At this step, the\ndaily min/max values were taken as the minimum of the hourly\
    \ minimum temperatures\nand a maximum of the hourly maximum temperatures. Clear\
    \ sky solar radiation was used\nwhen solar radiation data was missing. Solar radiation\
    \ was calculated as recommended in\nAllen, Walter, Elliott, Howell, Itenﬁsu, Jensen,\
    \ and Snyder [36]. Both AgSAT and station\nETref evaluations were performed on\
    \ a daily time step since a day is a typical time period\nover which ETref is\
    \ calculated and is generally the shortest period in which irrigation\npractices\
    \ are scheduled. The station location, longitude, latitude, elevation, climate\
    \ zones,\nand period of record for the available data needed for comparison are\
    \ shown in Table 3.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n8 of 21 \n \n\

    \ REF-ET \nsoftware of the University of Idaho. The agrometeorological data used\
    \ from weather sta-\ntions were temperature (°C), solar radiation (W m−2), and\
    \ wind speed (m s−1). Some \nweather networks included hourly minimum and maximum\
    \ temperatures. At this step, \nthe daily min/max values were taken as the minimum\
    \ of the hourly minimum tempera-\ntures and a maximum of the hourly maximum temperatures.\

    Goodness-of-ﬁt parameters, primarily the root mean square error (RMSE), percentage\n\
    bias (Pbias), correlation coefﬁcient (r), the concordance index (d), and the Nash–Sutcliffe\n\

    \ by experimenting in the Bekaa Valley, the food\nbasket of Lebanon. This valley\
    \ is one of the country’s most important agricultural produc-\ntion areas where\
    \ water-use estimates are critical for water management and resilience [47].\n\
    The primary driver threatening farmers to use less irrigation water for food production\n\
    is the valley’s growing water constraint. The experimental ﬁeld (1-ha) is located\
    \ at the\nAgriculture Research and Education Center at AREC and planted with a\
    \ potato crop during\n12 March–15 July 2020: the growing season. The ﬁeld was\
    \ irrigated with a micro-sprinkler\nsystem (5 × 5 spacing at 200 L/h for a sprinkler)\
    \ using the AgSAT-app irrigation recom-\nmendations. Irrigations were set at 4–5\
    \ day intervals with timings populated from the\nAgSAT app. The irrigation scheduling\
    \ experiment consisted of four plots of equal size.\nEach plot had its own ﬂow\
    \ meter installed on the laterals to monitor the amount of water\nirrigated. The\
    \ main weather parameters were taken from a Delta-T Devices weather station\n\
    located upwind within the ﬁeld and used to calculate ETref by the FAO Penman–Monteith\n\
    standard approach. Water lost due to wind drift and evaporation was estimated\
    \ using a\ncatch-can test at the beginning of the irrigation season. In addition,\
    \ soil moisture and crop\nyield measurements were held. A deep soil-water sensor\
    \ at 60 cm was installed to monitor\ndeep percolation.\n4. Results and Discussion\n\
    4.1. Global Validation\nAgSAT daily ETref aligned with the in situ measurements\
    \ of reference evapotranspira-\ntion from 18 weather stations (n = 46385) worldwide.\
    \ Daily ETref was reasonably predicted\nby the AgSAT model, as suggested by the\
    \ relatively low spread of most points in the scatter\nplots, close to the 1:1\
    \ line (Figure 4). Generally, RMSE was relatively low (1.27 mm/d), with\na very\
    \ small percentage of error (Pbias) (0.5%) driven by a slight positive bias (0.02\
    \ mm/d).\nThe NSE value of 0.79 shows that the AgSAT model can be classiﬁed as\
    \ acceptable. The\nconcordance index (d) approaches 1, indicating very good agreement\
    \ between AgSAT ETref\nand station ETref. The comparative analysis of the AgSAT\
    \ and the weather stations’ daily\nreference evapotranspiration at a site level\
    \ is shown in Figure A1, colored by climate type.\nAdditional accuracy statistics\
    \ are shown in Table A2 at a site level, including MAE, MBE,\nRE, and MAPE. Accuracy\
    \ statistics of AgSAT ETref comparison with station ETref at the\n18 studied sites\
    \ by climate are shown in Figure A2.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n11 of 22\n\
    \ \nany substantial Pbias in the AgSAT ETref estimation at all sites where Pbias\
    \ remained \nbelow 23%. AgSAT ETref was further evaluated across climatic zones.\
    \ The ETref model \nrevealed variability in model skill (Figure A2). The most\
    \ notable finding in group-wise \nanalysis based on climate was a general trend\
    \ in bias, with AgSAT ETref model underes-\ntimating ET in Dfb (humid continental)\
    \ climates and overestimating in humid subtropical \n(Cfa) climates. Based on\
    \ nearly all statistical measures, AgSAT ETref performed best in \nMediterranean\
    \ climates (Csa). \n \nFigure 4. AgSAT reference evapotranspiration comparison\
    \ with in situ measurements of reference \nevapotranspiration from 18 weather\
    \ stations. \n4.2. Field Validation \nThe total water applied during the irrigation\
    \ season was 590 mm. Water lost to wind \ndrift and evaporation was estimated\
    \ at 15–20% (depending on the irrigation time and \nwind speed) of applied water.\
    \ Total water reaching the soil was estimated at 487 mm. Soil \nwater content\
    \ at planting was at field capacity following an above-average rainfall at the\
    \ \nsite. The clay soil-available water in the root zone on 12 March 2020 was\
    \ 65 mm for 50 cm \nof the maximum potato root depth measured on-site for the\
    \ duration of the experiment. \nNo deep percolation was observed during the duration\
    \ of the experiment. The amount of \nwater used by the crop was estimated at 521\
    \ mm. The AgSAT app calculated a total ET of \n531 mm for the period May 1–July\
    \ 31. The resulting potato yield was 60 tons/ha from plot \n1, 53 tons/ha from\
    \ plots 2 and 3, and 46 tons/ha from plot 4 (due to weed infestations), \nindicating\
    \ a superb yield. Figure 5 shows the Kcb, ETref, and ETpot (potential evapotran-\n\

    \ planted \npotato crop (Figure 6) [35]. \nFigure 4. AgSAT reference evapotranspiration\
    \ comparison with in situ measurements of reference\nevapotranspiration from 18\
    \ weather stations.\nThe plot shows that AgSAT ETref agrees very well with the\
    \ station ETref, with an\nindex of agreement ranging from 0.8 to 0.98. The highest\
    \ index of agreement was apparent\nin California and Lebanon, indicating the suitability\
    \ of AgSAT for use in semi-arid and\narid regions where agriculture relies on\
    \ irrigation water and where water is scarce. The\nlowest error was obtained at\
    \ the Ireland station (RMSE of 0.62 mm/d, driven by a slight\npositive bias of\
    \ −0.4 mm/d). The most signiﬁcant error was observed at the Adrar station\nin\
    \ Algeria, with the highest RMSE (2.29 mm/d), driven by a negative bias of −1.91\
    \ mm/d.\nAgSAT ETref tended in the opposite direction at a site level, where it\
    \ overestimated ETref at\nthe Rafha, KSA (by 23%) and underestimated ETref at\
    \ the Adrar, Algeria stations (by −22%).\nThis could be due to the site hyperaridity\
    \ where reference conditions were not met; no\nadjustments were made to correct\
    \ station data. Very good model skills were observed at\nmost of the stations\
    \ (e.g., most of the stations such as Monastir, Tunisia, Aguas Emendadas,\nBrazil,\
    \ and Roches point, Ireland have very low mean bias error). We did not ﬁnd any\n\
    substantial Pbias in the AgSAT ETref estimation at all sites where Pbias remained\
    \ below 23%.\nAgSAT ETref was further evaluated across climatic zones. The ETref\
    \ model revealed\nvariability in model skill (Figure A2). The most notable ﬁnding\
    \ in group-wise analysis\nbased on climate was a general trend in bias, with AgSAT\
    \ ETref model underestimating ET\nin Dfb (humid continental) climates and overestimating\
    \ in humid subtropical (Cfa) climates.\nBased on nearly all statistical measures,\
    \ AgSAT ETref performed best in Mediterranean\nclimates (Csa).\n4.2. Field Validation\n\
    The total water applied during the irrigation season was 590 mm. Water lost to\
    \ wind\ndrift and evaporation was estimated at 15–20% (depending on the irrigation\
    \ time and wind\nspeed) of applied water. Total water reaching the soil was estimated\
    \ at 487 mm. Soil water\ncontent at planting was at ﬁeld capacity following an\
    \ above-average rainfall at the site. The\nclay soil-available water in the root\
    \ zone on 12 March 2020 was 65 mm for 50 cm of the\nmaximum potato root depth\
    \ measured on-site for the duration of the experiment. No deep\npercolation was\
    \ observed during the duration of the experiment. The amount of water used\nRemote\

    \ ETref\nThe AgSAT model uses gridded data to estimate ETref, which does not have\
    \ a small\nenough spatial resolution to best serve ETref estimation. For ETref\
    \ computations, weather\ndata should be collected over a reference surface as\
    \ deﬁned by ASCE-EWRI [48]. In arid\nareas with irrigated agriculture, the grid\
    \ cell size in the CFSV2 datasets used in the study\ncould extend well beyond\
    \ the weather station of interest. The grid cell would thereby\ncombine the microclimatic\
    \ conditions of an irrigated (representing reference conditions),\nand dry areas\
    \ (with non-reference conditions), possibly weakening the validity of the ETref\n\
    estimate. Another error anticipated in the gridded weather dataset is the assimilation\
    \ of\ndata. Overestimating temperature and underestimating humidity might occur\
    \ if irrigation\nand precipitation data are not used as assimilation input data,\
    \ especially in arid areas\nwhere irrigation is prevalent. This was noticed in\
    \ the arid-desert-hot (BWh) climate group,\nspeciﬁcally at the Rafha, KSA station\
    \ where AgSAT overestimated the ETref.\nAdditionally, AgSAT ETref is overestimated\
    \ in the humid subtropical climate zone\nspotted in the Indian River, Florida\
    \ station. Gao [49] mentioned that the Penman–Monteith\nmethod is unsuitable for\
    \ high humidity settings because of the linear assumption of\nsaturated vapor\
    \ pressure and air temperature. To maintain errors of less than 10–15%,\nGrignon\
    \ [50] recommended using non-linear equations in extreme conditions (high humid-\n\
    ity). In humid climates, condensation occurs during the night, leading to an overestimated\n\
    VPD [35], leading to a higher ETref.\nMoreover, the CFSV2 datasets generally represent\
    \ the weather conditions at the aver-\nage elevation of the grid cell. However,\
    \ air temperature can change rapidly with elevation\nat an average lapse rate\
    \ of −6.5 ◦C per 1000 m gained [51], leading to some misrepresen-\ntation of ETref\
    \ in areas with complex terrain if the gridded weather temperatures are not\n\
    adjusted to the weather station elevations. Nevertheless, AgSAT was designed to\
    \ work in\nagricultural areas with simple topography.\nGridded weather data also\
    \ pose a challenge due to their temporal resolution. CFSV2\nhas a coarse temporal\
    \ resolution of 6 h, which might be insufﬁcient for representing\nthe substantial\
    \ variation of the four weather parameters (air temperature, wind speed,\nhumidity,\
    \ and solar radiation) during a day, potentially reducing the accuracy of ETref\n\
    estimation. This was indicated by Hupet and Vanclooster [52], who found that errors\
    \ in\ndaily grass ETref can be as large as 27% even when an hourly sampling rate\
    \ is used.\nSome of the selected weather stations in the study are located at\
    \ or next to airports\nwhere paved surfaces are prevalent. In such surface type,\
    \ measured temperature and\nhumidity might be higher due to little to no moisture\
    \ available to vaporize and high energy\nto heat the air. Among these stations\
    \ are the Adrar, Algeria, and Kamishly, Syria, stations\nwhere AgSAT underestimated\
    \ the ETref. Both weather station and gridded data have in-\nherent errors and\
    \ uncertainties in a comparable matter. The weather station measurements\ntypically\
    \ have errors of 20–30% [53,54], as large as the gridded data errors [55]. The\
    \ gridded\nweather datasets overestimate standardized Penman–Monteith ETref from\
    \ weather stations\nby as much as 20–30% [56]. Other causes of error are related\
    \ to the scale and geolocation\nmismatch (a partial overlap between the area overlap\
    \ footprint of remote sensing vs. point\nmeasurements) [53,57].\nFuture research\
    \ could pursue the bias correction for the gridded weather data or\ndecreasing\
    \ ETref bias directly through statistical models or the use of theoretical adjustments\n\
    based on the surface to air proﬁles for temperature, wind, and humidity, as described\n\
    by [35,58]. Debiasing gridded data would allow the data to be used to its fullest\
    \ potential,\nbeneﬁting from temporal, spatial, and global coverage. Although\
    \ most of the used locations\nreliably produced low error without bias correction,\
    \ commonly, the gridded data requires\nbias correction in regions where a systematic\
    \ bias exists to improve their accuracy.\n4.5. Limitations and Future Work\nAs\
    \ with any technological advancement, the development and deployment of AgSAT\n\
    holds various limitations. Because AgSAT relies on vegetation reﬂectance data,\
    \ it is un-\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n16 of 22\nsuitable for greenhouse farms.\
    \ However, farmers who plant in greenhouses may still use\nthe weather data from\
    \ AgSAT and adjust them for greenhouse conditions. Jaafar and\nAhmad [59] provided\
    \ equations to derive in-greenhouse ET from outside ET and weather.\nCurrently,\
    \ AgSAT does not use a soil-water balance to derive irrigation schedules for farm-\n\
    ers, as this approach requires the farmers to input soil moisture data from ﬁeld\
    \ sensors. The\navailability of global gridded soil moisture at the ﬁeld level\
    \ is also another constraint. A\nsoil-water balance requires an estimate of irrigation,\
    \ rainfall, runoff, and deep percolation,\nall of which now cannot be calculated\
    \ or derived on the ﬂy. We plan to extend the app to\nread remotely sensed-based\
    \ soil moisture once this data becomes useful for agriculture.\nCurrently, only\
    \ very low-resolution gridded soil moisture data is available, which is not\n\
    very handy for ﬁeld-scale applications. Due to the limited availability of reliable\
    \ rainfall\ndata in real-time, users are encouraged to subtract rainfall amounts\
    \ from the irrigation\nwater requirements. We plan to add a rainfall dataset to\
    \ the model when such a dataset be-\ncomes available in higher resolution in Google\
    \ Earth Engine. However, the major strength\nof the app results from working conjointly\
    \ with farmers and irrigation managers during\nthe development of AgSAT, with\
    \ many features outlined and implemented based on their\nneeds and suggestions.\
    \ Despite the aforementioned constraints, AgSAT has been perform-\ning well since\
    \ its development, with many farmers relying on its guidance on irrigation\nquantities\
    \ and transitioning towards increasing water use efﬁciency in crop production.\n\
    Adjustments may be necessary in areas where local climate differs from gridded\
    \ weather\ndata due to complex topography or other speciﬁc micro-climatic conditions.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a novel global smart irrigation app (AgSAT)\
    \ as an efﬁcient and\nsimple tool calculating crop water requirements in near\
    \ real-time. The android smartphone\napplication was developed using available\
    \ Google Earth Engine datasets of both gridded\nweather data and surface reﬂectance\
    \ satellite imagery for calculating reference evapotran-\nspiration and crop NDVI.\
    \ AgSAT was assessed at the small ﬁeld level for irrigating a potato\ncrop, and\
    \ the reference evapotranspiration parameter it relies on was validated globally\
    \ in\nvarious climatic zones in many countries. The main app metrics, crop evapotranspiration\n\
    referenced to grass as developed by the ASCE-standardized Penman–Monteith equation,\n\
    were calculated from global climatic data (CFSV2) and have shown very good agreement\n\
    with the corresponding ET calculated from weather stations worldwide. Local adjustments\n\
    may be needed in complex topographies and areas with their own microclimate. Our\n\
    validation, herein, showed that the estimated crop evapotranspiration for AgSAT\
    \ could be\nused reliably, enabling the applicability of the developed smart irrigation\
    \ app. Moreover,\nthe results presented in this study allowed concluding that\
    \ crop growth coefﬁcients can\nbe derived using the highest publicly available\
    \ resolution (EAS’s Sentinel-2 at 10 m) and\nwere shown to be valid for agricultural\
    \ crops in major agricultural regions, including the\nUSA (California). Coverage\
    \ remains a challenge in cloudy regions where crop phenol-\nogy changes quickly.\
    \ This can be addressed in the future by utilizing synthetic aperture\nRADAR imagery\
    \ such as Sentinel-1. This study sought to contribute to the topic of smart\n\
    technologies in irrigation and has demonstrated an illustrative example of an\
    \ app that cuts\nback on high costs and the challenges of computerized applications\
    \ for the technologically\nchallenged farmer. AgSAT brings irrigation technology\
    \ to the farmer’s phone and provides\nan opportunity for combatting water scarcity\
    \ and mitigating the impact of climate change\non the world’s dwindling water\
    \ resources.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.J.; methodology, H.J.;\

    \ \ntechnique, sufficient amount of water and nutrients are crucial \nfor a plant's\
    \ growth and development. An electronic timer is \nusually used to control the\
    \ plant watering automatically and the \nscheduling is set according to different\
    \ levels of plant growth. \nThe timer has to be adjusted frequently since the\
    \ required \namount of water is different according to the growth stages. In \n\
    power outage-prone regions, the problem with scheduled \nirrigation using timer\
    \ becomes worsen since the watering \nschedule is disrupted by occasional black-outs,\
    \ leading to an \ninsufficient supply of water and nutrients, which leads to poor\
    \ \ncrop yields. Typical solution for such problems is by hiring field \nworks\
    \ to monitor the functionality of the automated system, \nplant health, and to\
    \ re-adjust the timer once a power outage \noccurs. However, this solution is\
    \ ineffective, time-consuming, and \nacquires high overhead costs. This paper\
    \ proposes a systematic \nirrigation method using the internet-of-things (IoT)\
    \ framework \nin order to improve the monitoring of plant growth and \nconsequently\
    \ improves the efficiency of the workflow. This \nsystematic fertigation monitoring\
    \ system consists of power \noutage alerts, and on-line notifications of plant\
    \ irrigation, \npesticide delivery, and polybag cleaning schedule. As a result,\
    \ by \nusing the proposed system, higher efficiency in farming \nmanagement is\
    \ achieved, with a 40% reduction in manpower, as \ncompared to a typical fertigation-based\
    \ farming system. This \nsystem demonstrates greater control over irrigation scheduling,\
    \ \nplant growth, recording of pesticide scheduling automatically, \nand polybag\
    \ cleaning, all of which will improve crop yields \nsignificantly. \nKeywords—Irrigation\

    \ \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe advancement in technology has influenced modern \n\
    farming methods signiﬁcantly and agricultural environment \nparticularly. The\
    \ agricultural landscape has shifted from \nconventional farming to digitized\
    \ farming with the merging of \ninterrelated computing devices, sensors, and cloud\
    \ edge [1-5]. \nIn addition, the combination of engineering and computing \ntechnology,\
    \ equipped with sensors for agricultural activities, \nhas enabled smart farming\
    \ [6]. As the demand for food sources \nincreases around the world, irrigation\
    \ has grown even more \nnecessary to prevent famine and nutritional deaths [7].\
    \ \nAdvanced irrigation techniques are essential in order to \nachieve eﬃcient\
    \ irrigation management, and an optimal \nagriculture management system will ensure\
    \ productivity, and \nenvironmental and economic viability [7-10]. Most techniques,\
    \ \nsuch as regulated deﬁcit irrigation [11], automated drip \nfertigation [10,12-13]\
    \ and precision irrigation systems oﬀer the \nopportunity to conserve irrigation\
    \ water, improve fruit quality, \nincreasing crop yield and decreasing costs while\
    \ contributing \nto environmental sustainability [14-15]. \nThe motivation of\
    \ this study is to improve the management \nsystem of the irrigation scheduling\
    \ by providing farmers with \nreal-time feedback during irrigation so that they\
    \ are notiﬁed of \nany abrupt loss of electricity, and can act based on the \n\
    information provided by the system. This enables farmers to \ndecide which nutrients\
    \ should be received by the plant by \ncontrolling the timing of the irrigation.\
    \ The system is easy to \ndeploy in existing drip fertigation systems, with a\
    \ plug-and-\nplay module insertion. The application also aims to provide \nfarmers\
    \ and farm workers with a user-friendly tool that \nfacilitates the management\
    \ of pesticides and drip maintenance. \nInstead of manually entering records,\
    \ farmers can track \npesticide schedules through the system, which makes the\
    \ \nprocess more manageable. It is expected that the proposed \nsystem could improve\
    \ the crops yield as well as equipped the \nfarmers with an improved and smart\
    \ farming management \nsystem. The results demonstrated that the developed system\
    \ \ncould eﬀectively facilitate fertigation management for outage-\nprone areas\
    \ and substantially decrease the need for on-site \nmonitoring. \nThe rest of\
    \ the manuscript is organized as follows. \nSection 2 describes related work in\
    \ the area of advanced \nirrigation. Section 3 describes the user-friendly platform\
    \ of the \nproposed system. This section also describes the real-time \nirrigation\
    \ feedback, which records current and past irrigation \ndurations, as well as\
    \ the alert system, which notifies farmers of \nany absence of electricity. Section\
    \ 4 describes the \nimplementation of the system and discusses the results, and\
    \ \nSection 5 presents the concluding remarks and future research. \n*Corresponding\

    \ OVERVIEW OF DRIP FERTIGATION METHODS \nDrip fertigation system is gradually\
    \ gaining acceptance, \nand is becoming more attractive to many farmers since\
    \ it \nsupplies nutrients and water to the plant root zone more \neﬀectively than\
    \ conventional planting [16]. To date, [17] have \nattempted to design an automatic\
    \ irrigation system, but its \nimplementation on actual farming sites has not\
    \ been fully \ninvestigated. Another study to improve the drip irrigation \ntechnique\
    \ was recently designed by [18]. Using this technique, \nfarmers do not have to\
    \ manually mix the fertilizer, which \nrequires them to read the EC and pH of\
    \ the mixture. Slow \nadoption of drip fertigation technology might be caused\
    \ by low \nexposure, lack of expert techno-logical support, and the high \ncost\
    \ of implementation, which includes hardware with \ncomputing, storage, and communication\
    \ capabilities. \nThe automated drip fertigation system is more appealing to \n\
    farmers worldwide, and has been gradually replacing \nconventional methods of\
    \ farming. This is mainly due to the \nimprovement in the quality of crops and\
    \ agricultural products, \nas adequate nutrition is delivered directly to the\
    \ plant root zone \n[19]. Such system saves signiﬁcant amount of time when \n\
    scheduled irrigation is performed remotely by turning pumps \nand valves on and\
    \ oﬀ [20]. In a study done by [21], \nproductivity for crops such as ginger shows\
    \ increment in net \nincome due to an increase in the yields of ginger. The crop\
    \ \nproductivity is almost doubled per hectare with an automatic \ndrip fertigation\
    \ system, compared to more conventional \nmethods. Although the drip fertigation\
    \ system requires a large \namount of initial capital, the cost will be compensated\
    \ by high \ncrop productivity. In [22], the authors introduce a real-time \nirrigation\
    \ system, named REUTIVAR, which calculates \nirrigation timing and fertilizer\
    \ amount required in real-time \nusing reclaimed water to watering olive tree.\
    \ This technique \nwill determine the timing of irrigation and fertigation events\
    \ \nand can optimize fertilizer injection, the stabilization time and \ncleaning\
    \ phase. \nThe development of useful new models based on the \ndecision support\
    \ system (DSS) has improved the automatic \nirrigation system [23-24]. An optimized\
    \ DDS with a modified \nfertigation systems (DSS-FS) is designed primarily for\
    \ drip and \nsprinkler irrigation, based on an environmental sustainability \n\
    approach [25]. Meanwhile, [20] developed a DSS system to \nprovide insight into\
    \ the irrigation time required for a given crop \nand how irrigation schedules\
    \ would change with soil types. All \nof these DSSs and models are very helpful\
    \ in optimizing the \nuse of water and fertilizer, and managing the centralized\
    \ \nfertigation system in a water distribution network. However, \nthe eﬀects\
    \ of occasional power outages on a scheduled drip \nfertigation system have not\
    \ been investigated. Occasional \npower failures disrupt the time required for\
    \ irrigation, \nunfortunately lead to an insuﬃcient supply of water, and will\
    \ \naffect crop growth. \nIn order to improve network performance to achieve more\
    \ \nreliable smart farming system, an adaptive technique was \nintroduced to maintain\
    \ reliable network connection to transmit \nsensor data to base station by adaptively\
    \ change the \ncommunication protocol between IEEE 802.11ac and \nLoRaWAN [26].\
    \ This technique is particularly useful to \nmanage large farming sites at different\
    \ location. On the other \nhand, \nAgri-Info, \na \ncloud \nbased \nautonomic\
    \ \nresource \nmanagement technique for agriculture service was introduced \n\
    in order to maintain required level of QoS. This method makes \nuse of Fuzzy logic\
    \ for making decisions based on defined rules \nto diagnose status as well as\
    \ schedule the resources \nautomatically [27]. \nIn Malaysia, farmers have started\
    \ to use the automatic drip \nfertigation system. However, due to poor technical\
    \ knowledge \nand the initial development cost of the system, the farmers \nprefer\
    \ not to use the DSS, and decide to manage their planting \nbased on their experience\
    \ instead. This is also the reason \nfarmers opt to hire workers to man-age scheduled\
    \ irrigation \nthrough on-site monitoring during power failure, which is very\
    \ \ntedious and time-consuming, and in doing so, results in high \nman-power utilization.\
    \ \nThe lack of technological advancement in drip fertigation \nhas left farmers\
    \ with no option but to use the commercial \nirrigation controllers available\
    \ at the market, which are pre-\nprogrammed to supply water at predeﬁned intervals.\
    \ Typical \ndrip fertigation system uses a timer and a valve to turn on the \n\
    water pump for irrigation. Fig. 1 shows a typical fertigation \nsystem that consists\
    \ of a water tank, a timer, a water ﬁlter, a \nwater pump, garden accessories,\
    \ and a piping system to \nchannel water to individual pots [28-29]. These pots\
    \ are \narranged horizontally on the ground or vertically with \nsupporting poles.\
    \ The water supply is pre-program and follows \na preset schedule. The amount\
    \ of water and nutrients required \nby each plant is diﬀerent each week, and normally\
    \ depends on \nthe stage of growth. Table I shows the required amount of \nwater\
    \ and nutrients required during the ﬁrst three weeks of \ngrowth [30]. This table\
    \ indicates that 600 ml is the total amount \nof water required per day for vegetables\
    \ such as spinach and \neggplants [31]. \n \nFig. 1. The Fertigation System. \n\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nMedium- and small-scale drip\
    \ fertigation farms still use the \nold and conventional method of observing the\
    \ plantation site to \ncheck the growth of the plants. Field workers are required\
    \ to \nmonitor faults in the irrigation system and to perform regular \nchecks\
    \ on the plants’ leaves and roots for possible plant disease \ninfection. The\
    \ only way to deter-mine poor plant growth is to \nexamine the condition of the\
    \ leaves and roots. Yellowish or \nwilting leaves are signs of poor growth. This\
    \ farming workﬂow \nresults in ineﬃcient monitoring, especially when the plantation\
    \ \nsite holds thou-sands of pots. Fig. 2 shows the process in a \nfertigation\
    \ system implemented for a local chili variety called \nCentil. \nCentil (Capsicum\
    \ Frustecens) is a type of red chili currently \ngrown in Johor, Malaysia on a\
    \ farming area with 1,000 pots \n[32]. Workers observe the irrigation process\
    \ for 20 minutes in \nthe morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon, and spend an\
    \ \nadditional 40 minutes every evening inspecting plants for \ngeneral health\
    \ and wilting leaves. They spend another 20 \nminutes in the evening inspecting\
    \ for pests and diseases and \nadministering pesticides. They perform maintenance\
    \ and \npolybag cleaning once a week for 30 minutes. These processes \nare repeated\
    \ until harvesting day. The detailed activities of the \nfarming process are presented\
    \ in Table II. \nIn areas where occasional power outages occur, the \nirrigation\
    \ schedule, which is based on the needs of each plant, \nis often disturbed. Instead\
    \ of turning to technological solutions, \nfarmers prefer to hire more workers\
    \ to look for faults in the \nirrigation system. With the current practice of\
    \ having workers \nobserve on-site, adding more workers to monitor faults results\
    \ \nin ineﬃcient irrigation management and high costs in labor, \nwhich in turn\
    \ fails to oﬀset the initial investment. Such a \nfertigation strategy defeats\
    \ the purpose of an automatic \nirrigation and water management system, and could\
    \ worsen \ndepending on the solution taken by the farmers. \nPrevious work in\
    \ the irrigation ﬁeld focused on calculating \nirrigation requirements, where\
    \ crop details fetched from the \nuser were taken as input to estimate water requirements\
    \ with \nthe help of sensors. However, with scheduled irrigation, water \nand\
    \ nutrient requirements cannot be fulﬁlled when the process \nis disturbed by\
    \ an electrical power outage. Detailed \ninformation on the nutrients supplied\
    \ is lost and irretrievable. \nThe system shuts down, and the sensors do not capture\
    \ \ninformation during the absence of electricity. This condition \nwill go unnoticed\
    \ without any notiﬁcation to the farmers, and \nwill last until power returns,\
    \ which may take hours or even \ndays. The problem becomes more serious during\
    \ dry seasons \nand in remote farming areas, where farmers are not aware of \n\
    such situations. \n \nFig. 2. Manual Process of Monitoring Plant Growth. \nTABLE\

    \ \nAll of these works provide interesting information on \nadvanced technologies\

    \ Under these circumstances, a system cannot \nperform real-time monitoring, which\
    \ is crucial for agricultural \napplications. Real-time monitoring is essential\
    \ because it \nprovides timely information on the actual status of farming \n\
    sites, such as the volume of water and fertilizer received, which \nis an important\
    \ factor in improving crop production. Thus, \nhaving a system to access real-time\
    \ data through a mobile \napplication during power failure would allow farmers\
    \ to \nrespond and act to the situation in timely manner. \n747 | P a g e  \n\

    \ SOLUTION \nIn this section, we describe the complete system of the \nproposed\
    \ automated monitoring system for watering and power \noutage alerts, with pesticide\
    \ and polybag cleaning notiﬁcations. \nThe proposed monitoring system comprises\
    \ of three main \ncomponents: (i) the overall system architecture; (ii) the sensor\
    \ \nsystems; and (iii) the mobile and web applications monitoring \ninterfaces,\
    \ as shown in Fig. 3. \nIn Fig. 3, a system administrator is in charge of the\
    \ farming \nsystem. This figure also shows that the farmers will use the \nmobile\
    \ application to monitor the system, receiving alerts and \nnotiﬁcations, and\
    \ interact with the system for pesticide \nscheduling and polybags maintenance.\
    \ The watering and power \noutage sensors are designed to detect whether the plants\
    \ have \nbeen watered, and to alert farmers through mobile notiﬁcations \nwhen\
    \ a power failure occurs. The notiﬁcations and alerts are \nsent through Global\
    \ System for Mobile Communications \n(GSM) to the internet service provider [33],\
    \ then to a cloud \nserver for data storage and processing. \nA. System Architecture\
    \ \nOur proposed monitoring system, as shown in Fig. 4, \nconsists of integration\
    \ of sensors with the existing fertigation \nsystem. The water sensor will be\
    \ installed in the main \ndistribution pipe, and on the other hand, the power\
    \ outage \nsensor will be installed on the power supply line. The proposed \n\
    system was developed by taking into account the important \nlayers of the IoT\
    \ architecture [34]. We introduced another layer \nfor troubleshooting and debugging\
    \ the sensors. This includes \nﬁxing the devices’ programming errors. In the second\
    \ layer, we \nhave our proposed watering and power outage detection \nsensors,\
    \ which are connected to an Arduino-based processor \nfor data processing. For\
    \ data transmission to the cloud server, \nthe devices connect wirelessly via\
    \ a GSM module, which is on \nthe third layer. The cloud server is on the fourth\
    \ layer, where \nall data is sent using the “post” application programming \n\
    interface (API) via a GSM module to the backend cloud \nprocessor. The cloud services\
    \ will cover all “post” and “get” \nAPIs from the GSM module and mobile applications.\
    \ Lastly, \nwe have a mobile application for monitoring and interaction, \nand\
    \ a web server for managing the system, as shown in Fig. 5. \nThe interaction\
    \ between the hardware, backend processor, \nand mobile applications is shown\
    \ in Fig. 6. Arduino will send \nthe “post” API to the backend processor on the\
    \ cloud via a \nGSM module. When the backend processor receives the API, it \n\
    will log it and update the record in the database. If a \nnotiﬁcation is required,\
    \ backend processor will trigger the \nFirebase server, which will then push the\
    \ notiﬁcation to our \nmobile application so that farmers will receive the notiﬁcation\
    \ \non their smartphones. For information updates, the mobile \napplication will\
    \ send the “post” and “get” APIs to request that \nthe data be updated on the\
    \ app. The cloud server acts as an \nintermediary between the sensors and the\
    \ mobile application. \n \nFig. 3. Components of the Fertigation System. \n \n\

    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nB. Sensor\
    \ System \nThe power outage sensor is powered by a 240 VAC main \npower source\
    \ that in turn is converted to a direct current (DC), \nwhich provides nine VDC\
    \ to the system by using an adaptor, as \nshown in Fig. 7. This is the main power\
    \ source for the \nfertigation system. The auxiliary power comes from the solar\
    \ \npanel, which charges a 3.7V 18650 Li-ion battery. The voltage \nfrom the battery\
    \ is then boosted to 9V and fed to a power \nselector circuit prior to Arduino.\
    \ The power selector takes the \npower in such a way that the power always comes\
    \ from the \nmain power source, except during a power outage, when it \ntakes\
    \ the power from the charged battery. \nThis power switch is instantaneous, similar\
    \ to an \nuninterrupted power supply (UPS), so that Arduino does not \nre-boot.\
    \ In the event of a power outage, the system will \nautomatically switch to the\
    \ solar-powered battery. While the \nsystem is using the battery, the transition\
    \ causes the system to \nsend a “power down” API token through a GSM module to\
    \ the \nbackend processing cloud server. When the server receives the \n“power\
    \ outage” API token, a power outage notiﬁcation is sent \nto a Firebase server,\
    \ which will then push it to the mobile \napplication. The dashboard will display\
    \ the power outage \nstatus, which will read “blackout has occurred” in red. This\
    \ \nfunction notiﬁes growers immediately when the system is no \nlonger using\
    \ the main power source. Thus, action can be taken \nto troubleshoot and to ﬁx\
    \ the problem. When the power outage \nsensor detects that the main source is\
    \ functioning again, it will \nsend the “power up” API to the server. Fig. 8 shows\
    \ the ﬂow of \nthe power outage sensor. The ﬂowchart shows that the “power \n\
    down” API and the “power up” API are sent to the server only \nwhen there is a\
    \ change in state. \n \nFig. 7. The Watering and Power Outage Sensors for Fertigation\
    \ System \n(Type A Module). \n \nFig. 8. Flow Chart for Power Outage Detection.\
    \ \nIn the fertigation system, the watering schedule uses a timer \nto activate\
    \ a water pump. The water pump releases water to the \nmain pipe for a period\
    \ of time determined by the volume of \nwater needed for each plant. Therefore,\
    \ it is crucial to know \nthat the plant has been watered according to the schedule\
    \ set by \nthe farmers. In our proposed system, the water detection sensor \n\
    is installed in the main pipe, where it will detect the presence \nof water. Water\
    \ detection only happens if there is a change in \nthe sensor as follows: \n1)\
    \ State 0 to 1 (No water is detected to Water is detected), \nAPI “watering start”\
    \ is called. \n2) State 1 to 0 (Water detected to No water) API “watering \nstop”\
    \ is called. \nWater detection is taken as an analogue input to Arduino. \nUpper\
    \ and lower boundaries are required for water detection. \nThe upper boundary\
    \ is required to determine the presence of \nwater, and the lower boundary lets\
    \ the water subside in the \npipe after the water pump has been turned off. The\
    \ ﬂowchart \nfor watering detection is shown in Fig. 9. \nTwo states of mobile\
    \ display are described as follows to let \nthe farmers know the watering status.\
    \ \n1) Watering has started: Indicates that watering has been \nexecuted as scheduled\
    \ and the water pump has been activated \nfor a duration speciﬁed by user. This\
    \ is activated when the \nsensor detects water, and the API “watering start” is\
    \ called. \n2) Watering has stopped: Indicates that watering has \nstopped, and\
    \ the API “watering stop” is called when the sensor \ndetects that the water has\
    \ subsided below the lower boundaries. \nWe designed two modules, type A and type\
    \ B, for watering \nand power outage sensors. For type A, the watering and power\
    \ \noutage sensors are combined in one module. This design is \nsuitable for fertigation\
    \ sites where watering sensors can be \ninstalled in close proximity to the power\
    \ outage sensor. \nThe type B module shown in Fig. 10 is designed for large \n\
    fertigation sites. The type B module allows the watering and \npower outage sensors\
    \ to be installed in different locations, thus \nincreasing the flexibility for\
    \ extended range. We used Long \nRange (LoRa) connectivity [35-37] for greater\
    \ connection \nbetween the watering and power outage detection sensors \nbefore\
    \ data is sent to the cloud server via the GSM module. \nThe GSM module requires\
    \ a lot of power to transmit data to \nthe server. The LoRa wireless transmission\
    \ cannot run on the \nArduino Uno processor due to its large memory requirement.\

    \ Monitoring Interfaces \nTo ensure our watering and power outage detection sensors\
    \ \nare functional 24 hours a day, Arduino will send the “I am \nalive” API to\
    \ the server every hour. The backend processor \nwill receive this “post” API\
    \ and update the database. This \ninformation will be sent to the mobile apps\
    \ when they send the \n“get” API, and the “sensor is online” status will appear\
    \ on the \nmobile app dashboard. The “I am alive” flowchart is shown in \nFig.\
    \ 11. However, if the server does not receive this API, it will \nstate that the\

    \ and Evaluation \nTo validate our system, type A watering and power outage \n\
    sensors were installed at the fertigation site. A water tank with \na capacity\

    \ are shown in Fig. 13. The farming \nactivities under the fertigation system\

    \ LED indicator that blinks rapidly every second \nthe GSM is not connected to\
    \ the network. When the module is \nsending a request signal to connect to the\
    \ network, the LED \nblinks every three seconds, and, when the blinking reaches\
    \ an \neven slower speed, it indicates that the net-work connection \nhas been\
    \ established. Since connecting to the network requires \na high current consumption,\
    \ an adaptor with power ration of \n9V 2A is used to power up the GSM module as\

    \ AND DISCUSSION \nWe discuss two elements for improvement. The first \nelement\
    \ involves the farming work-flow, and the second \ninvolves design-related module\
    \ performance. \nA. Improving Farming Work-Flow by the System \nThe proposed system\
    \ automates the first block in Fig. 2 \n(namely “watering”), which has been identified\
    \ as inefficient in \ngrowth monitoring. Workers are required to be on-site to\
    \ \nobserve the watering for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 \nminutes in the\
    \ afternoon. The proposed system improved the \nfarming work-flow by reducing\
    \ manpower while maintaining \nthe same yield production. Manpower was calculated\
    \ based on \nthree variables: project duration, number of hours per worker, \n\
    and number of workers. The project duration for the chili \nCentil, from transplant\
    \ to harvest, was six months. A worker \nworked for five days a week to perform\
    \ daily tasks, as shown \nin Fig. 2 that include: \n1) Observe watering: 40 minutes.\
    \ \n2) Plant inspection to check for health: 40 minutes. \n3) Inspection for disease:\
    \ 20 minutes. \nThus, the three tasks required 100 minutes (1.67 hours) for \n\
    each worker per day. The calculation considered 20 working \ndays per month for\
    \ six months (120 days). The manpower \ncalculation is shown in Table V. \nA typical\
    \ fertigation-based system requires 200.4 hours, \nwhereas the proposed system\
    \ requires 120 hours. Thus, with \nthis system, we reduce man-power by 40%. The\
    \ man-hour \nreduction would be more significant for a big farming site that \n\
    requires extensive monitoring. Five workers are required for \n1,000 plants, which\
    \ means a larger farm's manpower can be \nfurther reduced. In the cost relationship\
    \ shown in Fig. 15, the \nreduction in man-hours not only improved the operational\
    \ cost, \nbut increased the yield production as well. \nTABLE V. \nMAN-POWER CALCULATION\

    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nB. Water\
    \ Detection Sensor \nThe experiments were performed using two types of \nwatering\
    \ detection sensors. The first type was custom designed \nwith two protruding\
    \ gold pins. The pins are not connected \nelectrically, and act as a switch. Without\
    \ water presence, the \nsensor has an extremely low voltage (around 0.0-0.4 volts).\
    \ \nHowever, when water is flowing, depending on how \nsubmerged the pins are\
    \ or how strong the flow is, when more \nof the pins' surface area is covered\
    \ with water, the voltage will \nincrease. At the highest water flow, it is possible\
    \ to achieve \nover 2.8 volts across the pins. In a perfect water flow system,\
    \ \nthe value will drop or rise instantly between the “water \ndetection” and\
    \ “water not detected” stages. However, due to \nthe nature of the pipes used,\
    \ some excess water may still be \npresent in the pipes when the water stops flowing.\
    \ Thus, the \nvoltage drop is not instantaneous. \nFor example, from high water\
    \ flow we will get 2.8 volts, \nand the voltage drops to 2.5 volts when the pump\
    \ is stopped. \nAs time progresses, the voltage will decrease as the water \n\
    flows towards the end of the piping system and water levels \ndrop slowly. However,\
    \ this value is constantly fluctuating due \nto the formless nature of water,\
    \ which causes some motion \nwithin the pipe. As such, it can be deduced that\
    \ an optimal \n“water detection” voltage value would be any voltage higher \n\
    than 2.7 volts (upper boundary) and “water not detected” can \nbe any value below\
    \ that (lower boundary). When the water \npump is activated, there will be an\
    \ instant rise in voltage, \nexceeding the upper boundaries, and a sudden drop\
    \ in voltage \nto below the lower boundaries over a short period of time. \nTherefore,\
    \ a few seconds are given for the sensor to stabilize \nbefore the API “watering\
    \ start” is sent to the server. \nOther experiments were conducted with a typical\
    \ inline \nwater flow sensor made for an Arduino-based environment \nwith three\
    \ pole connections for 5V voltage input, one digital \ndata pin, and a ground\
    \ pin. However, the digital pin does not \nconnect to the standard digital input\
    \ pins on Arduino, but must \nbe connected to Arduino where Pulse Width Modulation\
    \ \n(PWM) is allowed. This connection enables Arduino to make \nthe necessary\
    \ calculations to transcribe data from the sensor \ninto a readable format for\
    \ the user. The sensor functions \nthrough the rotational motion created by an\
    \ electric rotor. The \nrotational speed of this rotor depends on the rate of\
    \ water \ntravelling through the sensor. The sensor, which is based on the \n\
    Hall effects phenomenon, will then send a corresponding pulse \nsignal to Arduino.\
    \ The rate at which the pulse signal is received \nwill directly correlate to\
    \ the rate of water flow: that is, slower \npulses mean a lower flow rate, while\
    \ faster pulses mean a \nhigher rate. \nAn “API Start” API token is sent when\
    \ the upper boundary \nis reached. We calculated the upper boundary by measuring\
    \ the \nreading of the irrigation system. The lower boundary for \nsending the\
    \ “watering stop” API token was set to zero. This is \nbecause when the water\
    \ flow stops, even though there may still \nbe water in the pipes, the value of\
    \ the water flow will be set to \n0 as long as the water is not moving. The measured\
    \ value of \nthe water flow was calculated in liter per minute (l/m). Some \n\
    precautionary steps were taken when using the water flow \nsensor. Firstly, the\
    \ water flow sensor had a small diameter to \nallow a pipe to fit on it. Appropriate\
    \ adaptors were used when \nthe pipe was larger than the hole of the water flow\
    \ sensor. \nSecondly, most commercial Arduino-based water flow sensors \nhave\
    \ a maximum flow rate of 30 (l/m). In addition, it is unclear \nif higher water\
    \ flow directly influences the accuracy and \nefficiency of the water flow sensor.\
    \ It is currently unclear if \nthis damages or adversely affects the sensor in\
    \ any way. \nC. Battery-Powered Solar Cell Charging and Discharging \nRate \n\
    Since the system is operated by a back-up battery in the \ncase of power failure,\
    \ we analyzed the total operating time of \nthe back-up supply by studying the\
    \ battery’s charge and \ndischarge time. To control the charging process as well\
    \ as to \nprotect the battery from overcharging, the level at which the \nbattery\
    \ will supply sufficient power was noted. \nAn experiment was conducted to study\
    \ the rate of power \nloss for the 18650 battery over time without direct power\
    \ from \nthe mains. The experiment was conducted with the system \nrunning, and\
    \ voltage measurements were taken across the \nbattery. The experiments were conducted\
    \ a few times, and the \naverage readings were calculated. The result of the discharge\
    \ \ntime is illustrated in Fig. 16. \nExperiment 1 in Fig. 16 shows the voltage\
    \ loss over time \nfor a battery initially charged up to 4V. There is a slow semi-\n\
    linear loss of voltage over time until around 3.3V, where the \nvoltage will reduce\
    \ exponentially until a value of 2.2V is \nreached. Experiment 2 was conducted\
    \ to determine whether \nthis pattern could be replicated. Experiment 2 shows\
    \ the \nvoltage loss over time for a battery that has been fully charged \nto\
    \ 4.17V. Similar to the first experiment, the voltage indicates a \nslow, semi-linear\
    \ decrease until around 3.3V, where the rate of \nvoltage discharge increases\
    \ tremendously in an exponential \nfashion. It can also be seen that the final\
    \ voltage of 2.2 V will \nremain for a period of time and will not decrease further.\
    \ \nDuring these experiments, the system was able to run as long \nas the voltage\
    \ was above 2.2V; however, after this point, \nalthough the voltage did not decrease\
    \ further, Arduino and the \nGSM module would be off. This indicated that the\
    \ system did \nnot have the required power to run. Experiment 1 showed that \n\
    the sys-tem can run up to 6.7 hours, whereas experiment 2 \nshowed that the system\
    \ can last for 8.3 hours de-pending on the \ninitial charged voltage of the battery.\
    \ \n \nFig. 16. Discharge Voltage over Time for Battery Powered Solar Cell. \n\
    D. Study of Switching during Power Outage \nIn the event of power failure, supply\
    \ is cut off from the \nmain. The designed circuit instantaneously switches to\
    \ the \nbattery charged by the solar cell. The switching processes from \n752\
    \ | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nmain supply to battery\
    \ and vice versa were observed in terms \nof response time. In this case, the\
    \ transient response of the \ntransition time for both cases was observed. There\
    \ is a small \nperiod in which the module switches to a new power source \nwhen\
    \ another has stopped. Fig. 17(a) shows the voltage against \nthe transition time\
    \ between main supply and battery-powered \noperation. On the contrary, Fig. 17(b)\
    \ shows the transient result \nof the voltage of the switching state between battery-operated\
    \ \nto the adaptor-operated supplies. \nFig. 17 shows that it took 400 microseconds\
    \ for both \nsituations to switch from one state to another, as de-noted by \n\
    the bandwidth of both pulses. Essentially, when the states are \nswitched from\
    \ one power source to another, this creates a \ntransient that can be measured\
    \ as denoted by the peaks in the \ngraph. Thus, the time it takes for the switching\
    \ to occur is \nmeasured by the time it takes for the transient peak to rise and\
    \ \nfall. A short switch time is ideal, as it ensures that the system \nwill have\
    \ constant power and can efficiently switch between \npower sources with minimal\
    \ transition. Arduino will go to reset \nstate if the transition takes too long,\
    \ and the whole system will \nbe reset. \nE. Comparison Study \nTable VI highlights\
    \ the comparison between the proposed \nsystem and the previously developed intelligent\
    \ systems in \nterm of key features that record real-time irrigation of plants,\
    \ \nthe duration of scheduled irrigation for each cycle, the history \nof nutrients\
    \ supplied to the plants, and, more importantly, an \nalert sent to farmers so\
    \ that quick action can be taken during a \npower outage to prevent severe damage\
    \ to the plants. Our \nmonitoring system is an attempt to present a solution that\
    \ \nrecords the length of the irrigation process, notiﬁes farmers in \nthe event\
    \ of power failure, and tracks the irrigation history \nthrough an easy-to-use\
    \ mobile application that guides farmers \nand farm workers. The solution is a\
    \ user-friendly platform that \ndoes not require any knowledge of programming.\

    \ was developed for chili fertigation \nfarming of 1000 pots of plant. So far,\
    \ it also only been tested in \na location that is prone to electrical blackout.\
    \ Although, the \nresults show significant improvement over the conventional \n\
    method applied on the same scope, the results and performance \nwill be more accurate\
    \ if the system is tested over various kinds \nof plants with larger pots (~2000\
    \ pots and more) and the data \nare observed over longer period of time i.e. three\
    \ to six months. \nFurthermore, the proposed system should also be tested in \n\
    various locations that are prone to blackouts to further evaluate \nis effectiveness\
    \ and efficiency. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have demonstrated a systematic\
    \ and \nautomated method for monitoring large-scale chili fertigation \narea in\
    \ order to improve the farm management efficiency and \nconsequently to improve\
    \ plant growth in a power-outage-prone \narea. The system, which consists of sensors\
    \ for detecting \nirrigation activities and power outages, a mobile application\
    \ to \nmanage scheduling for pesticide delivery and polybag \ncleaning, and a\
    \ web application to al-low farmers to manage \nplanting schedules has shown improvement\
    \ in efficiency in \nfarming management, with a 40% reduction in manpower in \n\
    this power outage-prone area, compared to a typical \nfertigation-based farming\
    \ sys-tem in such area. The proposed \nsystem also exhibited greater control over\
    \ plant growth and \nautomatically records pesticide schedules and polybag \n\
    cleaning, all of which could improve crop yields. We believe \nthe findings and\
    \ the method of using IoT platform as a \nsystematic monitoring mechanism, presented\
    \ in this paper, will \npave the way and encourage further use in broader plant\
    \ types, \nwhich could prove useful in a large farming area in rural sites. \n\

    Agroclimatic Evolution web \napplication as a powerful solution \nfor managing\
    \ climate data\nManuel Soler‑Méndez1, Dolores Parras‑Burgos2*, Rachid Benouna‑Bennouna1\
    \ & \nJosé Miguel Molina‑Martínez1\nApplying the AgroClimatic Evolution web application\
    \ allows inquiries being made, data \nbeing collected and variables being calculated\
    \ with the data acquired from different public \nagrometeorological stations on\
    \ a single platform. Today all these stations from Murcia and Andalusia \n(Spain)\
    \ are included, and stations elsewhere in Spain are being incorporated. This web\
    \ application also \noffers the possibility of including each user’s own stations,\
    \ which increases the number and availability \nof data close to each farmer’s\
    \ plots. The data collected from stations is employed to collect daily data \n\
    about weather and times, which are used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo). All the \ndata are saved in a cloud database to later consult them and\
    \ study their evolution. The data provided \nby all the stations are validated\
    \ by applying the filters indicated in Standard UNE 500540:2004 \n“Automatic weather\
    \ stations networks” by eliminating mistaken data that could alter correct ETo\
    \ \ncalculations. With the filtered data, and having calculated ETo, the user\
    \ is provided with a comparison \nmade with the raw data supplied by public stations.\
    \ The main objective of this tool is to optimize the \nuse of water resources\
    \ available from data acquisition. Managing these data will contribute to make\
    \ \nagriculture more sustainable and compatible with the natural environment.\n\
    In recent decades, the agricultural sector has undergone marked transformation\
    \ that has evolved over time. It \ncan be stated that the first step began with\
    \ the mechanization of farm work and the introduction of fertilizers and \nphytosanitary\
    \ products. Later significant progress was made thanks to information and communication\
    \ tech-\nnologies (ICT) being introduced, which enables vast quantities of data\
    \ about soil status, water availability, crop \ndevelopment, the amount of plant\
    \ sanitary product applied to each plant, etc., to be collected and  transmitted1–6.\
    \ \nAll this, along with historic information about weather, the progression of\
    \ plagues or diseases, is leading to a \nmajor transformation in the sector that\
    \ is increasing productivity and  competition7.\nTherefore, the management and\
    \ integration of different databases will be one of the advances that will have\
    \ a \nstrong impact in forthcoming years because it will allow decisions to be\
    \ quickly, effectively and accurately made \nto optimize production and  costs8.\n\
    At the same time, this sector faces low water availability and increasingly degraded\
    \  quality9. Therefore, efficient \nwater resources management is the main tool\
    \ to confer farms stability and  sustainability10. In relation to this, \nthe\
    \ use of ICT is an excellent support to efficiently manage water  resources11.\
    \ Employing ICT in agriculture is \nbased on using sensors that monitor various\
    \ agri-environmental variables related to the soil–plant-atmosphere \ncombination\
    \ to quantify or estimate water  requirements9. Knowing environmental data allows\
    \ the evapotranspi-\nration (ET) demand in an area to be calculated, with which\
    \ the consumption of a given crop can be estimated by \napplying the corresponding\
    \ corrective coefficients. Such information can help to more efficiently manage\
    \ irriga-\ntion. As a network of public agrometeorological stations that obtain\
    \ such data exists, placing them at farmers’ \ndisposal seems important.\nDifferent\
    \ websites can be found on the Internet that offer interesting agroclimate information\
    \ to be \n consulted12–14, although some shortcomings have been detected that\
    \ should be stressed. Some examples of \nthese shortcomings are: (i) the web format\
    \ does not match that of mobile devices; (ii) data consultations are \nawkward\
    \ and slow; (iii) consulting time data is impossible; (iv) forms to consult data\
    \ are lacking; (v) data can-\nnot be plotted as graphs; (vi) there are no weather\
    \ forecasts; (vii) no basic data about stations to make inquiries \nwith are available.\n\

    In order to overcome these deficiencies and to offer users a practical and efficient\
    \ tool, a web application \nhas been developed to: (i) consult ETo; (ii) consult\
    \ data from the different selected stations; (iii) obtain weather \nforecasts.\
    \ The aim of this project is to have a web application that meets a series of\
    \ minimum characteristics that: \n(a) is simple; (b) offers a responsive presentation,\
    \ that is, it adapts to different devices; (c) serves to collect data \nin real\
    \ time to calculate daily ET and its time to be later stored in a database.\n\
    Another objective of this project is for users to make accurate irrigation decisions\
    \ by bearing in mind informa-\ntion on the ET demand offered by this tool. This\
    \ allows improved water resources management without having \nto invest in any\
    \ sensors network.\nMaterials and methods\nWebsites analysis. \nThere are two\
    \ types of web-based weather information systems:\na) Private stations: These\
    \ allow data to be obtained close to each farmer’s plot, provided that as many\
    \ weather \nstations as are of interest are invested. This is an advantage in\
    \ terms of the representativeness of the data for \neach farmer; however, it has\
    \ the disadvantage of the high cost of the investment.\n \ni. An example is the\
    \ service offered by Sencrop (www. sencr op. com), which centralises all the data\
    \ \nfrom privately installed stations on one platform (if the owner so wishes)\
    \ and makes them available \nto other users, thus reducing the investment cost.\n\
    \ \nii. Another example is offered by Envira IOT (www. envir aiot. es/ monit oriza\
    \ cion- meteo rolog ica- \nagric ultura- preci sion/), which installs a private\
    \ weather station and offers data provided with \nalgorithms that facilitate user\
    \ interpretation.\nb) Public stations: There are numerous web services that offer\
    \ historical weather data collected from the existing \nnetwork of weather stations\
    \ in Spain. In general, access to these data is free of charge, but the microclimate\
    \ \nof a particular farm may differ from the data provided by the nearest weather\
    \ station.\n \ni. SIAR (Agro-climatic Information System for Irrigation) (https://\
    \ eport al. mapa. gob. es/ websi ar/ \nInicio. aspx) offers data from stations\
    \ located throughout Spain, through its website (and even has \na mobile App).\n\
    \ \nii. At the level of autonomous communities, some offer this service through\
    \ their own portals, with \ndata from the same stations: SIAM of the Region of\
    \ Murcia (www. siam. imida. es), InfoRiego of \nthe “Junta de Castilla y León”\
    \ (www. infor iego. org/ openc ms/ openc ms/ info_ meteo/ index. html), \nRIA\
    \ of the “Junta de Andalucía” (https:// www. junta deand alucia. es/ agric ultur\
    \ aypes ca/ ifapa/ \nriaweb/ web/), among others.\nThe potential of the data collected\
    \ in these services lies in their free access, and in the quality of the data\
    \ \ncoming from a Spanish network. On the other hand, the consultation of data\
    \ is, in general, not user-friendly, \nnor is it adapted to mobile devices. In\
    \ addition, data are consulted whose processing requires considerable office \n\
    skills to be interpreted. These services lack the ability to graph the data, and\
    \ the possibility of easily storing them \nin their own database.\nTaking into\
    \ account the study carried out, the AgroClimatic Evolution web application was\
    \ developed, \ndesigned to provide free access to data to users, in a user-friendly\
    \ and simple way. But this application is part of \na broader project, the GENHIDRO\
    \ platform (www. genhi dro. es), aimed at the efficient and autonomous man-\n\
    agement of fertigation systems.\nTherefore, the aim of this project is to ensure\
    \ that the data obtained through AgroClimatic Evolution are not \nmerely a mere\
    \ visualisation and storage of data, but feed a more complex decision-making system\
    \ for advice and \neven the direct management of fertigation systems. GENHIDRO\
    \ is a platform under continuous development \nand aims to offer the user the\
    \ possibility of interacting with the irrigation system based on data collected,\
    \ among \nothers, from meteorological information services such as those consulted\
    \ through AgroClimatic Evolution.\nTheorical background. \nThe ETo was calculated\
    \ in this project. This ETo concept occurs under certain \nconditions, on a reference\
    \ surface and with no water restrictions. The ETo is a variable to study atmospheric\
    \ ET \ndemand regardless of crop type and crop development.\nBy relating ET to\
    \ a given surface, a reference ET is obtained. From this value, ET values on other\
    \ surfaces can \nbe related. This will allow analyses based on ET alone, and independent\
    \ of other site-specific variables. Thus, \nETo will be the reference ET under\
    \ certain growing conditions, for a reference crop. The ETo value will express\
    \ \nthe evapotranspiration capacity of the atmosphere at a given location and\
    \ time of year; but it does not take into \naccount the characteristics of the\
    \ crop or soil type. The great advantage of using ETo to estimate water require-\n\
    ments is that its value only depends on climatic parameters, which are easy to\
    \ obtain.\nTo understand the ETo concept, it is necessary to define what a reference\
    \ surface is. According to FAO-56, it \nis a “hypothetical reference crop with\
    \ crop height of 0.12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s  m-1 and an albedo\
    \ \nvalue (i.e., portion of light reflected by the leaf surface) of 0.23”15.\n\
    To calculate this parameter, the FAO Penman–Monteith method is recommended because\
    \ it is the only stand-\nardized method that determines ETo with climate  parameters16.\
    \ This method of Zotarelli was selected because \nit roughly approaches the ETo\
    \ of any town, has robust physical bases, and explicitly incorporates physiological\
    \ \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports |         (2022) 12:6716  | \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10316-7\n\
    www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nand aerodynamic parameters. The data required\
    \ to apply the FAO Penman–Monteith method are location, \ntemperature, relative\
    \ humidity, radiation and wind.\nDetermining ETo is extremely important for estimating\
    \ a crop’s water requirements or for conducting studies \nregardless of the crop\
    \ type to be grown. Knowledge about ETo and the grown crop allows adjusted irrigation\
    \ \ndoses to be established and crop performance to improve.\nTo calculate the\
    \ ETo, we applied the equations of the FAO Penman–Monteith method available in\
    \ FAO-56. \nWe began with daily ETo, calculated by the expression below:\nwhere:\n\
    ETo  Reference evapotranspiration [mm  day-1]\nRnNet radiation the crop’s surface(MJ\
    \  m-2day-1)\nRa Extraterrestial radiation (mm  day-1)\nG Ground heat flow(MJ\

    \ (kPa °C-1)\nγ Psychometric constant (kPa °C-1)\nFor the calculation of each\
    \ and every one of the parameters involved in Eq. (1), the methodology established\
    \ \nby Zotarelli et al.16 has been followed. Thus, the daily ETo estimate is obtained,\
    \ expressed in mm·day-1.\nTo obtain the ETo value at the hourly level, the expressions\
    \ indicated by Zotarelli et al.16 vary slightly. Thus, \nfor hourly periods, the\
    \ FAO Penman–Monteith equation for the calculation of ET is modified as follows:\n\
    where:\nETo  Reference evapotranspiration [mm  hour-1]\nRn Net radiation on the\

    The data provided by all the stations are validated by applying filters at levels\
    \ 0 and 1 as indicated in Standard \nUNE 500540:2004 “Automatic weather stations\
    \ networks: Guidance for the validation of the weather data from \nthe station\
    \ networks. Real time validation”. At level 0, the structure of the data record\
    \ is validated, i.e. that the \nnumber of data received is the same as the number\
    \ of data expected, as well as the date and/or time, taking as \ninvalid those\
    \ that do not comply. Level 1 establishes the physical limits within which the\
    \ different climate vari-\nables must move, beyond which data are considered null.\
    \ Table 2 shows the physical and instrumental limits \nestablished by the UNE\
    \ 500540:2004 standard. With the filtered data, and once the ETo calculations\
    \ have been \nobtained, the user is provided with a comparison made with the raw\
    \ data supplied by the public stations.\nTo validate the correct execution of\
    \ the process of obtaining data from the meteorological services mentioned, \n\
    the following test was carried out: a weather station was taken at random, during\
    \ a randomly chosen month, and \nthe data provided directly by the service were\
    \ compared with those generated by the web application developed \n(Tables 3,\
    \ 4, and 5).\nTo achieve an attractive and practical front-end, the information\
    \ has been organised with HTML, CSS and \nJavaScript programming.\nResults\nThe\
    \ result of this work is a user interface which shows the information that users\
    \ require and request. This \ninformation is taken from databases and the different\
    \ APIs. The application’s interface is divided into different \ntabs as the following\
    \ screenshots show. The Home Page offers general information about the tool (Fig. 2).\
    \ The \nsecond tab shows the followed methodology described in the previous section\
    \ (Fig. 3).\nThe third tab is Data, where various available parameters can be\
    \ consulted (Fig. 4). Here the desired agro-\nmeteorological station can be selected\
    \ by the interactive map on the left or by unfolding the menus on the right. \n\
    After selecting a station, a table appears with basic and simplified information\
    \ to learn the general details of \nwhat is selected. The map that opens was developed\
    \ by a scalable vector graphics (SVG) editor. The advantage \nof using SVG is\
    \ the scalability with which adjustments can be made in different sizes with-out\
    \ losing properties. \nDifferent sections appear at the bottom of the screen to\
    \ select the desired interval of dates and, for the Murcia \nRegion (Spain), the\
    \ option to consult the hourly ETo appears (Fig. 5).\nHaving selected the agrometeorological\
    \ station and the desired intervals, a figure and a table appear with \nthe requested\
    \ data (Fig. 6). Moreover, the Data page also shows the weather forecast, plus\
    \ further data from the \nselected station (Fig. 7).\nThe next tab of the web\
    \ application is that of stations. It shows a picture gallery to know agrometeorological\
    \ \nstations’ location (Fig. 8). An unfolding menu appears at the top with all\
    \ the options of the available stations. \nWhen a station is selected, the related\
    \ pictures are automatically obtained. The images available in the Murcia \nRegion\
    \ belong to the SIAM 13. The last tab that the web application offers is the Contact\
    \ tab, with information \nabout location, social networks and contact details.\
    \ Finally, the web application is responsive and adapts to dif-\nferent devices.\n\
    With this study, what has been achieved is to unify valuable information for the\
    \ farmer, in a responsive web \ntool, with user-friendly visualisation on both\
    \ PC and mobile devices. It also allows the data to be integrated into \nTable\

    \ system can be controlled, thus facilitating the farmer’s \nwork. In current\
    \ solutions, either a costly tool is available through private weather stations,\
    \ or an obsolete public \ndata tool is available, but which in no case allows\
    \ interaction with the fertigation system.\nConclusions\nThe AgroClimatic Evolution\
    \ web application considers developing irrigation management software with data\
    \ \ncollected from agrometeorological stations’ sensors provided or owned by different\
    \ organizations. With the data \noffered by agrometeorological stations, an adaptive\
    \ and responsive web application was developed for different \nkinds of devices\
    \ that allows daily and hourly ET to be consulted for distinct stations. The intention\
    \ of this tool is \nto improve irrigation management by making better use of water\
    \ and suitably meeting crop needs by collecting \nand analyzing these data.\n\
    This can be achieved as follows: (i) the tool facilitates calculating the climate’s\
    \ ET demand; (ii) by know-\ning crop coefficients, crop water requirements are\
    \ estimated; (iii) by knowing crop irrigation needs, both the \nquantities of\
    \ supplied water and  CO2 flow rates from land can be reduced, which also helps\
    \ to reduce the carbon \nfootprint. By doing so, and following the agricultural\
    \ policy proposals of the Council Commission and the \nEuropean Parliament about\
    \ the European Green Pact, whose aim is to pursue a climatically neutral Europe\
    \ by \n2050, work will be done to help to fulfill this objective. With the developed\
    \ web application, access can be gained \nto all information from any device in\
    \ a much simpler and more practical way to consult ETo, weather forecasts \nand\
    \ details about the selected stations.\nTable 3.  Comparison of temperature data\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and

    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning

    INTRODUCTION  \nWater scarcity is currently one of the world's most pressing issues.\
    \ Water is required for the survival \nof all humans, animals, and plants in our\
    \ daily activities. It is a basic need for everyone and a valuable natural \n\
    resource for all living things on the planet [1]. Agriculture is one of the most\
    \ water-intensive fields, and the \navailability of water in agriculture helps\
    \ to regulate the temperature of the soil, cools the plants, essential for \n\
    the germination of seeds, the growth of plant roots, and the multiplication of\
    \ soil organisms. Due to \npopulation growth and increased food demand, agriculture\
    \ alone uses about 85% of the available freshwater \nresources worldwide [2].\
    \ Water is a limited resource for agricultural production, therefore, for greater\
    \ yields, \ncareful use of it through irrigation, which is one of the techniques\
    \ for conserving and controlling water \nwastage, and also allows farmers to avoid\
    \ dependence on rainwater [3], [4]. It is important to optimize the \n      \n\
      \n \n       ISSN: 2252-8776 \nInt J Inf & Commun Technol, Vol. 11, No. 1, April\
    \ 2022: 65-75 \n66 \nuse of available water resources, which can be achieved through\
    \ a combination of crop selection, water \nmonitoring techniques, and an efficient\
    \ irrigation method. Traditional irrigation methods face many \nchallenges such\
    \ as wastage of water, high cost of hiring human power, and also the farmers must\
    \ be present \nin their farmland in order to do irrigation process. Hence, the\
    \ development of an internet of things (IoT) \nbased smart irrigation and tank\
    \ monitoring system to reduce water wastage, minimize human effort, and \nremotely\
    \ monitoring of water level and water supply via the internet. The use of IoT\
    \ allows organizations and \nindividuals to access information, and facilitates\
    \ important decision-making processes, it is based on \nincreased machine-to-machine\
    \ communication and decreased human-to-human or human-to-computer \ninteraction.\
    \ IoT refers to a wireless network between objects, enabling a new form of communication\
    \ \nbetween people and things. It enables things to take action on their own,\
    \ thus eliminating the human-centric \nmediation role [5]. In general, the major\
    \ importance of a smart irrigation system is its ability to save water \ncompared\
    \ to conventional watering methods that waste as much as 50% of the water used\
    \ which causes \ninefficiencies in irrigation, evaporation, and overwatering of\
    \ the crops. Several automated techniques based \non IoT have been proposed for\
    \ irrigation systems these include the use of Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, cellular,\
    \ \nand other communication technologies to make the system smart. However, these\
    \ techniques have their \nshortfalls such as Bluetooth and ZigBee which cannot\
    \ handle long-distance transmission, and cellular-based \ntechniques with the\
    \ problem of high-power consumption and increase operating costs, but provide\
    \ a wide \nrange of communication [6]. The designed system uses Wi-Fi technology\
    \ to provide a low-cost design for a \nsmart irrigation system, monitors water\
    \ tank level, and is easy to access in the farmland.  \nThe rest of this paper\
    \ is prepared in the following sections. Section 2 discusses the related works\
    \ in \nsmart irrigation systems with a detailed description of existing systems.\
    \ Section 3 focuses on the architecture \nof the designed system with details\
    \ of components used, circuit diagram, and flow chart. Section 4 \nimplementation\
    \ of the design system and results are discussed. Finally, the last section discusses\
    \ the \nconclusion and future research. \n \n \n2. \nRELATED WORKS \nThe researchers\
    \ in [7], [8], proposed a real-time automation system based on an ARM7TDMI core\
    \ \n32-bit microprocessor and global system for mobile communication (GSM) module\
    \ which operate through \nshort message service (SMS) as a link between advanced\
    \ RISC machine (ARM) processor and centralized \nunit. GSM is used to inform the\
    \ user about the exact field condition via SMS. The system constantly \nmonitors\
    \ the soil moisture, water level, temperature, and humidity, and provides details\
    \ about the field to the \nuser via SMS. The GSM transmits this data to the ARM7\
    \ for processing and displays the output on a liquid \ncrystal display (LCD).\
    \ The activation instruction starts the motor and indirectly activates the transistorized\
    \ \nrelay circuit, which continuously monitors environmental parameters and turns\
    \ off the motor whenever the \nrequired level is reached, sending a message to\
    \ the farmer. The drawback of the system proposed by [7], is \nthat GSM has a\
    \ fixed maximum cell site range of 35 km which is imposed by technical limitations.\
    \ Secondly, \nit is not user-friendly to farmers due to the entire complexity\
    \ of AT commands, and finally, soil parameters \nregarding fertilizers and plant\
    \ diseases are not incorporated into the system. \nWireless sensors and dual tone\
    \ multiple frequency (DTMF) dialing were used in an irrigation \nmanagement system\
    \ [9]. DTMF used is a combination of one low frequency and one high-frequency\
    \ tone to \nidentify the dialed number or a signal. The designed system allows\
    \ farmers to control irrigation and provides \na remote-control facility by switching\
    \ it (ON/OFF) using the landline or mobile phone by dialing specific \nDTMF codes\
    \ GSM network. However, the use of DTMF makes it less user-friendly and also offers\
    \ limited \ncontrol options. Similar research based on wireless networks and DTMF\
    \ was proposed by [10], their \nproposed system used one single module to control\
    \ all the sectors automatically, and maintain irrigation time. \nIt is a low-cost\
    \ design with no extra internet cost that can work over a long distance but does\
    \ give \ninformation about the water tank level.  \nAbbas et al. [11], proposed\
    \ a smart irrigation system using a wireless sensor network. The system \nused\
    \ moisture sensors to detect the soil moisture and helps to identify the water\
    \ holding capacity of different \nsoil characteristics based on the fact that\
    \ the different plants consume water differently. The design is aimed \nat determining\
    \ the time taken for the sensors to get activated and to identify the watering\
    \ zone. However, the \nsystem does not take into account other factors like monitoring\
    \ the water tank level. A voice-controlled \nirrigation system that can be controlled\
    \ using an authorized mobile phone is described in [12]. The system is \nmade\
    \ up of two sub-units; a pump control unit (PCU) and a farm control unit (FCU).\
    \ The soil moisture is \nmonitored and irrigation valves are controlled by the\
    \ FCU, while the pump operation is controlled by the \nPCU, which is based on\
    \ the water level in the tank. The voice commands from the user’s mobile phone\
    \ and \nsoil moisture with water level data were used to control the system. The\
    \ designed system offers a low-cost \ndesign with low latency.  \nInt J Inf &\

    \ proposed a smart irrigation system to improve water-energy efficiency. Their\
    \ \nsystem consists of a microcontroller, sensors, and a water pump that is integrated\
    \ with the decision-making \nsystem. The system makes its decision on whether\
    \ irrigation is needed by developing a truth table using \nenvironmental information.\
    \ The sensors used in the design are temperature and moisture sensor which serves\
    \ \nas input parameters for the truth table and are placed in the area that requires\
    \ irrigation. A decision was made \nbased on input parameters by activating the\
    \ sprinklers. The microcontroller communicates with sensors using \nBluetooth\
    \ technology and collects data from moisture sensors and temperature sensors.\
    \ The data collected are \nevaluated through a truth table to determine whether\
    \ the given region needs to be irrigated. Their system \nprovides an effective\
    \ irrigation schedule system and improved water-energy efficiency.  \nThe use\
    \ of a wireless network, a motor controller unit (PIC16F877A), and a GSM module\
    \ with \nwireless valve control to provide a low-cost irrigation system is proposed\
    \ for an IoT-based irrigation system \nand water consumption for crops in research\
    \ by [14]. Another smart irrigation system based on a wireless \nsensor network\
    \ with dual tone multiple frequency (DTMF) is developed by [15]. The developed\
    \ system uses \nan 8051 microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and dual tone multiple frequency (DTMF) \nreceiver to calculate, control, and\
    \ monitor the water requirements for crops based on soil moisture data \nacquired\
    \ by numerous sensors nodes deployed in the field. The developed system is low-cost,\
    \ and it also \nprotects the soil's fertility by significantly minimizing soil\
    \ leakage.  \nKumar [16] proposed an automatic irrigation and security system\
    \ that uses a wireless sensor \nnetwork (WSN). The designed system consists of\
    \ Raspberry Pi, Arduino, a transceiver, and three sensors \n(soil moisture, temperature,\
    \ and passive infrared sensor (PIR)). The Raspberry Pi serves as a coordinator\
    \ \nnode (CR node) and Arduino serves as an end node device with nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ for wireless \ncommunication and data transfer. The sensors read soil status\
    \ and wirelessly transferred the data to the \nRaspberry Pi to activate the water\
    \ pump. This system monitors the condition of the farm on the webpage and \ncan\
    \ turn on/off the water pump through the webpage. The PIR sensor with a buzzer\
    \ was used to protect the \ncrop from the cattle entering the field. The system\
    \ has improved the problem of water wastage in farmland, \nhence resulting in\
    \ increased yield and more profit to the farmer. A similar system was designed\
    \ by Bolu et al.  \n[17] using Arduino Mega 2568 and nRF24L01 transceiver with\
    \ five sensors to perform a low-cost automated \nirrigation system powered by\
    \ solar energy.  \nSavić and Radonjic [18] proposed a ZigBee-based wireless sensor\
    \ network (WSN) system with a \nDHT11 sensor for air temperature measurement and\
    \ an Arduino-based sensor node (Watermark 200SS) for \nsoil moisture measurement\
    \ and a DHT11 sensor for air temperature measurement. The system was \nimplemented\
    \ using the Libelium Waspmote microcontroller platform as the main control unit\
    \ of the proposed \nsmart irrigation system. The system is simple and low-cost\
    \ to implement with reliable data transmission that \ndelivers necessary information\
    \ for independent decision-making in a smart irrigation system, but the range\
    \ of \noperation is limited. Also, [19] proposed a wireless sensor network system\
    \ for IoT-based irrigation systems \nusing a Pic microcontroller and GSM module,\
    \ their system can be monitored via smartphone or personal \ncomputer. \nAlso,\
    \ Leh et al. [20] designed a smart irrigation system, the system is split into\
    \ two parts: hardware \nand software. Three components make up the hardware: a\
    \ soil moisture sensor, a temperature and humidity \nsensor (DHT 11), and an ESP\
    \ 8266 Wi-Fi module connected to an Arduino Mega 2560 microprocessor. The \nmicrocontroller\
    \ processes data from sensors that automatically water the plants and analyze\
    \ the real-time soil \nstatus of the plants via an internet-connected smartphone.\
    \ The Blynk application software is installed on the \nsmartphone and connected\
    \ to the hardware implementation, which uses the DHT 11 sensor and moisture \n\
    level sensor to detect the plant's status. The designed system compared their\
    \ results over a seven-day normal \nirrigation system. The findings show that\
    \ smart irrigation systems outperformed normal irrigation systems. \nThe system\
    \ can be controlled from a smartphone by the farmer, but when implemented in large\
    \ quantities, it \nis expensive because every plant must be equipped with sensors\
    \ to know the condition of the soil, and a water \npump must be installed for\
    \ every plant to supply water. \nSudharshan et al. [21] proposed smart irrigation\
    \ to reduce the wastage of water using a temperature \nsensor, humidity sensor,\
    \ and soil moisture sensor with an Arduino microcontroller. The system uses fuzzy\
    \ \nlogic rules to operate the solenoid valve based on data acquired from the\
    \ sensors which are later sent to the \ncloud using adafruit.io where the farmer\
    \ can see the values obtained by the three sensors. The system is \npowered by\
    \ a solar panel to run the pumps.  \n \n \n3. \nPRESENTATION OF THE DEVELOPED\
    \ SYSTEM \nThe designed system is an Internet of Things-based irrigation and tank\
    \ monitoring system, which is \ndivided into hardware and software components.\
    \ The system's hardware components are installed with an \nATMEGA328P microcontroller\
    \ for hardware development. The installation is accomplished in stages. The \n\
    architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN:\

    \ \n \n \n3.1.  Hardware specification \nIn the design of the system, the following\
    \ hardware components were used to achieve the \npurpose; Arduino UNO microcontroller\
    \ board (ATMEGA328P), HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture \nsensor, solenoid\
    \ valve, liquid crystal display (LCD), Wi-Fi ESP8266 module, power supply, driver\
    \ circuit \n(IRF3205, 10kΩResistor, 1N4007 Diode). \n \n3.1.1. Arduino UNO \n\
    The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATMEGA328P microcontroller,\
    \ which \nruns at 5 V, 16 MHz clock speed, 14 digital input/out pins, 6 analog\
    \ input (A0–A5) pins, 6 PWM outputs, 1 \nuniversal asynchronous receiver transmitter\
    \ (UART), and programming interface (USB) via ATMega16U2. \nThe Arduino UNO microcontroller\
    \ has one or more central processing units (CPUs), memory, and \nprogrammable\
    \ input/output peripherals that are geared for embedded use. It consists of a\
    \ programmable \ncircuit board and ready-to-use software called the Arduino integrated\
    \ development environment (IDE), which \nis used to write and upload C/C++ computer\
    \ code to the physical board. Arduino can also be connected to \na  cloud or t\
    \ h e  internet by interfacing it with a Wi-Fi module ESP8266. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the Arduino \nUNO board (ATMEGA328P micro-controller) used in this designed\
    \ system. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Arduino UNO board ATMEGA328 micro-controller\
    \ [22] \n \n \n3.1.2. Water level sensor (ultrasonic HC-SR04) \nThe water level\
    \ sensor monitors the amount of water in the tank and determines whether there\
    \ is \nenough water to supply. The ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 is used to measure\
    \ distances between 2cm to 400 \ncm with a 3 mm precision. A floating pad is placed\
    \ within the tank and it is planted on top of the water tank. \nThe tank's depth\
    \ is estimated by measuring the distance between the floating pad regularly, and\
    \ any changes \nare recorded in the mobile app. The basic idea of ultrasonic distance\
    \ measuring is based on echo; when \nsound waves are sent in the deployed environment,\
    \ they have reflected the source as echo after contacting \nan obstacle (water\
    \ surface). Figure 3 shows the ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor module. \nInt J Inf &\

    \ and tank monitoring system (Tayo Dorcas Obasanya) \n69 \nThis module has only\
    \ four pins connected to the Arduino UNO, which are: \nVCC pin – \n5 V (ranging\
    \ from 4.5 to 5.5 V) \nTrig pin – \nSensor input (trigger)  \nEcho pin – \nOutput\

    \ Soil moisture sensor \nThe water content in the soil is measured by a soil moisture\
    \ sensor. It makes use of the electrical \nresistance of the soil, which has two\
    \ probes that operate as a variable resistor. Increased water content in the \n\
    soil results in better conductivity between the probes and lower resistance. The\
    \ module has four pins, VCC, \nground, and A0 are connected respectively to the\
    \ Arduino board and parameters will be set based on the \ndatasheet. \nIt is used\
    \ to detect moisture in the field and send it to a microcontroller, which then\
    \ controls the \nwater tank or solenoid valve (ON/OFF). Figure 4 shows the soil\
    \ moisture sensor module used in the design. \nThe ADC is used to convert the\
    \ analog output of the soil moisture sensor to digital. The moisture sensor is\
    \ \nused to determine if water is present around the sensor. It is inserted into\

    \ and then measures the resistance to determine moisture content. The \nmore water\
    \ in the soil, the easier it is to conduct electricity (less resistance), while\
    \ dry soil conducts \nelectricity poorly (less resistance). Hence, it measures\
    \ from 0-1023 in resistance, where 300 below indicates \nmuch water, 300 to 800\

    \ valve is a basic electromagnetic device that converted electrical energy directly\
    \ into \nlinear mechanical motion. It was used as a water control valve. The solenoid\
    \ valve used in the designed \nsystem converts electrical energy to mechanical\
    \ energy, which then drives a mechanical valve to regulate \nthe flow of water\
    \ through the system by opening, closing, or adjusting the position of the valve.\
    \ The valve is \nclosed with no power, but when supplied with 12 V, the value\
    \ will open. To control this valve with the \nmicro-controller which runs on 5\
    \ V, the solenoid valve is connected to a driver circuit to switch on the 12 V\
    \ \nwith the small circuit input supplied by the micro-controller. Figure 5 shows\
    \ the solenoid valve used in the \nimplementation. The solenoid valve used in\
    \ this research is rated:  \n- \nVoltage=12 vdc \n- \nCoil resistance=37.5 Ω \n\
    - \nCurrent=320 mA  \n- \nPower=4.8 W  \n- \nPressure=3psi \n \n3.1.5.  Wi-Fi\
    \ module ESP8266 \nThe data must be transferred to the internet and monitored\
    \ remotely when all of the parameters have \nbeen measured and validated. This\
    \ is accomplished by the use of a Wi-Fi module, which enables real-time \nresponse.\
    \ The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is a self-contained system-on-a-chip (SOC) with an\
    \ integrated TCP/IP \nprotocol stack that can be used to connect to your Wi-Fi\
    \ network from the microcontroller. The ESP8266 \nwas used in this designed system\
    \ to run an application or delegate Wi-Fi networking functions. Data \nexchange\
    \ between this module and the microcontroller is achieved by a logic level shifter\
    \ circuit because the \nmicrocontroller is powered with 5volt and the ESP8266\
    \ is powered by 3.3 V. Pins are arranged in two rows, \nhaving 4 on each row.\

    \ valve works at a different voltage compared to that of the Arduino board and\
    \ the two \ncannot be directly connected as the solenoid valve works with 12 volts\
    \ while the Arduino and the sensors \nwork with 5 V. Hence, the driver circuit\
    \ is employed to act as a bridge and as well as a switch. The driver \ncircuit\
    \ comprises the IRF3205 MOSFET, 10 kΩ resistors, and diode. The resistor was connected\
    \ to the leg \nof the gate, one leg of the diode was connected to the drain and\
    \ to 12 V power supply (this prevented the \ncurrent from going to the Arduino\
    \ board), and the source was connected to the ground. The MOSFET \nallows a small\
    \ dc voltage (5 V) from the Arduino digital pin to switch a larger 12 Vdc voltage\
    \ to the \nsolenoid. It can be thought of as a switch, applying a current to the\
    \ Gate which allows current to flow. The \ndiode (1N4007), which is used in this\
    \ circuit as a flyback diode connected across the inductive load \n(solenoid valve)\
    \ in order to eliminate voltage spike across the load as well as prevent the 12\
    \ V from the \nexternal supply from going back into the circuit in order not to\
    \ damage the board. \n \n \nInt J Inf & Commun Technol  \nISSN: 2252-8776 \n\

    \ soil moisture sensor, and ultrasonic sensor are positioned at their field (in\
    \ the \nsoil and at the top of the water tank). These measures the water content\
    \ in the soil and the level of water in \nthe tank respectively. The microcontroller\
    \ reads the values measured by the sensors and displays the values \nand information\
    \ on the liquid crystal display. The Wi-Fi module ESP8266 interfaced with the\
    \ microcontroller \nconnects the system to the internet, where a mobile phone\
    \ or laptop can access it. This device (mobile phone \nor laptop) searches for\
    \ the system’s Wi-Fi to connect to it, with this device the user then opens the\
    \ browser to \ncontrol the irrigation with the web application developed for this\
    \ purpose and monitor the Irrigation process \nthat is the status of the water\
    \ tank and the soil is done by loading the IP address 192.168.4.1 on the web \n\
    browser. To control the irrigation process, the user simply toggles the pin13\
    \ on the web application interface \nwhere the solenoid valve is connected on\
    \ the board to turn the solenoid valve on/off. \nAlso, the Wi-Fi module enables\
    \ the microcontroller to upload the values measured to the web by \nloading the\
    \ IP address 192.168.4.1. The LED turns on whenever the solenoid valve is activated\
    \ and turns off \nwhen the solenoid valve is deactivated. Figures 11(a) and 11(b)\

    \ irrigation system and monitoring water tank. \nFarmers can get an update about\
    \ farmland anywhere using any internet-enabled device as a means to access \n\
    data and control the irrigation system. The device is connected to the internet\
    \ via the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module \nand can be operated remotely through internet-enabled\
    \ mobile devices such as mobile phones and laptops. \nThe system has demonstrated\
    \ that water can be preserved while achieving quality irrigation of crops. The\
    \ use \nof a soil moisture sensor helps to detect and monitor the level of water\
    \ in the soil which solves the problem of \nan uncontrolled irrigation system.\
    \ The designed system is a low-cost system with very reliable efficiency \nwhich\
    \ tends to reduce human effort and wastage of water.  \nThe system is limited\
    \ to the supply of water from the tank to the field only, refilling or pumping\
    \ \nwater to the tank was not considered. In the future, the camera can be incorporated\
    \ into the system to monitor \nfarmland and detect intrusions such as animals\
    \ and humans in the agricultural field using PIR sensor or \nimage processing\
    \ techniques. In addition, the system can be improved upon by adding a solar power\
    \ system \nwhich provides constant power to the system for pumping the water tank.\
    \ Finally, the designed system can be \nimplemented in large farm areas to ease\
    \ the stress.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] \nS. Nallani and V. B. Hency, “Low power\

    Tutorial on Agricultural IoT: Fundamental Concepts, Architectures, Routing, and
    Optimization. IoT 2023, 4, 265-318. Copy Abstract This paper presents an in-depth
    contextualized tutorial on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), covering the fundamental
    concepts, assessment of routing architectures and protocols, and performance optimization
    techniques via systematic survey and synthesis of related literature. The negative
    impacts of climate change and the increasing global population on food security
    and unemployment threats have motivated the adoption of the wireless sensor network
    (WSN)-based Agri-IoT as an indispensable underlying technology in precision agriculture
    and greenhouses to improve food production capacities and quality. However, most
    related Agri-IoT testbed solutions have failed to achieve their performance expectations
    due to the lack of an in-depth and contextualized reference tutorial that provides
    a holistic overview of communication technologies, routing architectures, and
    performance optimization modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although
    IoT applications are founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT)
    varies based on specific performance and users expectations as well as its technological,
    architectural, and deployment requirements. Likewise, the agricultural setting
    is a unique and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not apply,
    hence the need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these
    via the following contributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental
    concepts, technologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2)
    an evaluation of the technical design requirements of a robust, location-independent,
    and affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking fault
    tolerance techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control
    (MAC) protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth
    case study on how to design a self-healing, energy-efficient, affordable, adaptive,
    stable, autonomous, and cluster-based WSN-specific Agri-IoT from a proposed taxonomy
    of multi-objective optimization (MOO) metrics that can guarantee an optimized
    network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new taxonomies of
    faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)
    networks and a 3-tier objective framework with remedial measures for designing
    an efficient associated supervisory protocol for cluster-based Agri-IoT networks.

    \ tutorials have been authored on this subject, they present\nmere classifications\
    \ of communications trends on classical IoT [2,5–8] without any context-\nspecific\
    \ technical considerations of the critical design expectations in Figure 2. For\
    \ instance,\nthe authors in [2,6,7] examined IoT’s communication infrastructure,\
    \ platforms, standards,\ndevelopment trends, and possible network solutions in\
    \ agriculture. Similarly, the roles of\nindustrial IoT (thus, identification-based\
    \ IoT (example, RFID [6], WSN [9], QR codes [5],\nbarcodes) and communication-based\
    \ IoT (example, ZigBee [5], Z-wave [6], MQTT [5,6],\nLoRa [10], SigFox [11], BLE\
    \ [12], Li-Fi [5], Wi-Fi [13], Near-Field Communication (NFC) [5],\nand power\
    \ line area network) were reviewed in terms of current research trends, applications,\n\
    and main challenges in [5]. Although RFID tags and WSNs have similar data acquisition\n\
    capacities, the authors concluded that WSN technology is more energy-efficient\
    \ and suitable\nfor Agri-IoT than the costly RFID technologies [5]. Overall, Agri-IoT\
    \ technology has not\nyielded its intended paradigm transformation in the agricultural\
    \ sector due to several technical\nchallenges that have not received adequate\
    \ contextual research considerations [14]:\n1.\nThe agricultural setting is a\
    \ unique area where conventional IoT technologies do\nnot apply. Existing Agri-IoT\
    \ solutions are location-restricted because they are mostly\nbased on Wi-Fi or\
    \ cellular communication technologies and electricity grids with\nconstrained\
    \ coverages in Africa. A typical African agricultural setting lacks access\nto\
    \ reliable electricity and the Internet for cellular/Wi-Fi-based technologies,\
    \ and the\nintended users (farmers) of Agri-IoT technology are low-income earners\
    \ with limited\ntechnological expertise. Common Agri-IoT applications mainly utilize\
    \ architecture-\nrestricted, high-resource-demanding routing techniques (e.g.,\
    \ routing over low-power\nand lossy networks protocol (RPL)) and communication\
    \ standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Zig-\nBee, LoRa, Wi-FI, and long-term evolution (LTE))\
    \ [15], which are difﬁcult to access\nin typical African farms. Consequently,\
    \ Agri-IoT users in Africa expect a context-\nrelevant solution that is affordable,\
    \ simple to deploy and operate by non-experts,\nlocation-unrestricted, supportive\
    \ of large-scale farm management, and based on freely\navailable technologies\
    \ that do not require licensing. Thus, they are unlike popular IoT\nuse cases\
    \ such as medical, vehicular, and industrial IoT, whose designs are mainly\naffected\
    \ by critical factors including security, stable connectivity, and interference,\n\
    respectively, Agri-IoT is compelled to drive on affordable battery-powered SNs,\
    \ which\nmake architecture, low-power communication technology, power optimization,\
    \ cost,\nfault tolerance, multihop routing, scalability, and environmental impact\
    \ critical design\nfactors in order to address its resource or deployment-induced\
    \ challenges [12,16,17].\n2.\nHigh susceptibility to faults and failures: Agri-IoT\
    \ networks are vulnerable to faults\nand failures since the resource-constrained\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in hostile envi-\nronments to autonomously operate\
    \ via a network supervisory protocol with limited\npost-deployment maintenance\
    \ services. This supervisory protocol must incorporate\nsufﬁcient power optimization,\
    \ auto-fault management (FM), and self-adaptability\ntechniques in order to achieve\
    \ the desired performance expectation. Due to the lack of\nan in-depth and context-relevant\
    \ tutorial that bridges the gap between theoretical tax-\nonomies and real-world\
    \ designs, most canon Agri-IoT testbed solutions, such as those\nauthored in [1,10,11,17–20],\
    \ suffered abrupt failures during outdoor deployments.\n3.\nAgri-IoT technology\
    \ lacks comprehensive context-based synthesis from SN de-\nsign to ﬁeld deployment.\n\
    The power- and resource-constrained SNs that form\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT network\
    \ in the aforementioned context require limited\ndata transmission rates, computational\
    \ capabilities, memory capacities, commu-\nnication distance, and operational\
    \ stability. Consequently, the associated routing\nprotocol [9,12,17,21], communication\
    \ technology, and routing architecture [22–24]\nmust support mechanisms that ensure\
    \ packet size and communication distance mod-\neration [16], efﬁcient channel\
    \ access management (CAM), and SN’s tasks manage-\nment. It is not a mere application\
    \ of conventional IoT to a farm, as many authors\nattempted [1,10–12,17–20,23,25,26],\
    \ which lacked application-speciﬁc requirements\nsuch as dense network inter-connectivity,\
    \ higher information perceptibility, compre-\nIoT 2023, 4\n268\nhensive intelligence\
    \ services, remote monitoring, smart decision making, and the\nexecution of precise\
    \ control/actuation actions on the farm.\n4.\nSuperﬁcial consideration of desired\
    \ communication technologies of Agri-IoT with-\nout considering the cluster-based\
    \ architecture: To date, Agri-IoT-related surveys and\ntutorials focused on high-power-demanding\
    \ communication technologies (Wi-Fi and\ncellular-based technologies), the centralized\
    \ architecture-constrained ZigBee standard,\nand the operation principles of conventional\
    \ IoT as authored in [1,10,11,14,18,19]\nwithout an in-depth consideration of\
    \ the unique case of Agri-IoT. It is well estab-\nlished that the cluster-based\
    \ architecture is the best candidate for Agri-IoT applica-\ntion [12,16,17,24];\
    \ however, there are no systematic evaluations to cement this fact.\nFor instance,\
    \ most benchmarking WSN-based IoT testbed solutions are founded on the\nZigBee\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 communication standard and high-resource-demanding Wi-Fi,\ncellular-based,\
    \ and 6LoWPAN/IPv6 routing standards. These standards also thrive on\nwired or\
    \ ﬁxed IP-based infrastructural backbones, total Internet/electricity coverage,\n\
    and highly complex graph-based and centralized routing protocols [1,10,11,14,18,19],\n\
    leading to a lack of global signiﬁcance because Africa, which is the focus of\
    \ this study,\nhas less than 50% electricity/Internet coverage [27]. Also, ZigBee,\
    \ Wi-Fi and cellular-\nbased communication technologies with centralized or ﬂooding-based\
    \ routing archi-\ntecture [1,10,11,14,18,19] are capital-intensive, complex to\
    \ manage, location-restricted,\nenergy-inefﬁcient, and over-reliant on ﬁxed supporting\
    \ infrastructure. Therefore,\nan in-depth contextual assessment of how low-power\
    \ communication standards such\nas LoRa, SigFox, and Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)\
    \ evolve in cluster-based Agri-IoT\n(CA-IoT) networks can be of immeasurable beneﬁts\
    \ to the IoT community and farmers.\n5.\nThe role of Agri-IoT in eliminating food\
    \ insecurity, improving crop quality, alle-\nviating global poverty, and increasing\
    \ agricultural production volumes has been\nunderestimated [2,7,8,10,16,28,29].\
    \ The agricultural sector, which has been hindered\nby climate change, is the\
    \ largest global employer [3]. To revitalize this sector, CA-IoT\nhas emerged\
    \ with the most promising opportunities to address food and employ-\nment insecurity\
    \ issues and improve crop quality and economic conditions for the\nfarmers. However,\
    \ these beneﬁts have not been fully realized due to insufﬁcient\nresearch publicity.\n\
    To the best of our knowledge, no survey or tutorial articles have sufﬁciently\
    \ consid-\nered these technical issues and provided sufﬁcient technical guidelines\
    \ for the designers of\nAgri-IoT systems to make well-informed decisions in order\
    \ to achieve satisfactory network\nperformance. Additional realistic research\
    \ is needed regarding the contextual evaluation\nof SN design and deployment factors,\
    \ fundamental network design concepts and require-\nments, multi-objective optimization\
    \ (MOO) analysis of the parameters for designing the\nassociated routing protocol,\
    \ and efﬁcient operational metrics of the WSN sublayer of the\nAgri-IoT using\
    \ the cluster-based architecture. In addition, the assessment of the possibil-\n\
    ity of using low-power and accessible wireless communication technologies such\
    \ as BLE\nvia cluster-based architecture to achieve a complete infrastructure-less,\
    \ cheaper, energy-\nefﬁcient, self-healing, adaptive, and robust Agri-IoT network\
    \ is imperative. Furthermore,\na broader contextual overview covering all vital\
    \ aspects such as the fundamental concepts\nof Agri-IoT, technical design requirements\
    \ of SNs and WSN-based Agri-IoT, surveys of the\nbenchmarking communication standards,\
    \ routing protocols, and testbed solutions, and an\nin-depth case study on how\
    \ to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, adaptive, and CA-IoT\nbased on the\
    \ performance and users expectations are illustrated in Figure 2. Such a refer-\n\
    ence document can help support researchers when they attempt to accurately model\
    \ and\noptimize the performance of Agri-IoT [14] so that the performance gap between\
    \ the simu-\nlated networks and the realized Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1] can\
    \ be addressed. By way of\naddressing these technical challenges, this tutorial\
    \ presents the following contributions:\n•\nPerform an in-depth synthesis and\
    \ review (1) the basic concepts of Agri-IoT, (2) the\ncomprehensive design considerations\
    \ of these networks, (3) the technical design re-\nIoT 2023, 4\n269\nquirements\

    \ present\nsystematic surveys on routing protocols, FM techniques, and the canon\

    \ 9 examines how the above\ndiscussions have evolved using a case study of cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) for precision\nirrigation.Section 10 unveils open issues and\
    \ future works, while Section 11 concludes\nthe paper.\n1.1. Comparative Overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT Technologies\nA comparative overview of the underlying\
    \ technologies (i.e., WSN, IoT, and Agri-\nIoT) forming the WSN-based Agri-IoT\
    \ are compared from the perspective of architectural\nvariations, users’ expectations,\
    \ and design and implementational differences in Table 1.\nAs depicted in Figure\
    \ 3, WSNs are formed by spatially distributed, autonomous,\nresource-constrained\
    \ SNs that wirelessly interconnect to communicate their sampled data\nto a BS\
    \ for further monitoring or event tracking purposes without necessarily requiring\n\
    the Internet. The main components of the WSN are the SNs, the BS/gateway, and\
    \ the\nevent sampling/routing software that supervises the entire network process.\
    \ A node\nmay route data directly or via relay SNs to the BS based on its location\
    \ and assigned\ntasks. The BS locally takes actionable decisions and execution\
    \ of the actuation actions.\nAlthough the WSNs are resource-constrained and fault-vulnerable,\
    \ they constitute the\ninevitable part of this technology [2] and the underlying\
    \ innovation of the WSN-based\nAgri-IoT framework. In contrast, classic IoT consists\
    \ of IoT devices that sense and transmit\ntheir sampled information directly or\
    \ via telemetry to the Internet for monitoring or event-\ntracking purposes, mostly\
    \ via the centralized routing architecture. Like BS in WSNs, IoT\ndevices can\
    \ connect to the Internet/IoT cloud via ﬁxed-line (thus, for a factory), 5G/4G/LTE\n\
    cellular/mobile networks, or Wi-Fi for further processing, storage, and decisions/actions.\n\

    Figure 4. Conceptual framework: Agri-IoT-based farm monitoring and control cycle.\n\
    The main hardware components of an Agri-IoT framework, as presented in Figure\
    \ 3\nand Table 2, include the WSN (i.e., comprising the ﬁeld-deployed SNs or IoT\
    \ devices),\na base station (BS) or gateway or actuator controller, cloud servers,\
    \ and the user’s monitor-\ning/control devices. The on-farm participants (e.g.,\
    \ SNs and BS) in Agri-IoT are mostly\nbattery-powered and must be equipped with\
    \ sensing, computing, and communication\nabilities to form infrastructure-less,\
    \ robust, self-healing, and self-conﬁgured WSNs for data\ncollection and event\
    \ management [33]. The core units of the SNs in Figure 3c and the BS\nare compared\
    \ and contrasted in Table 2. As the framework in Figure 3a depicts, the IoT\n\
    devices can sense, process, and transmit their sampled data directly to the Internet\
    \ or IoT\ncloud without a gateway, whereas the SNs in WSN-based Agri-IoT perform\
    \ likewise via\na BS. This resource-sufﬁcient BS interfaces between the IoT cloud/user\
    \ and the WSN or\nactuator control system. It can also process the received data\
    \ and locally execute actionable\ndecisions via the actuator of the farm event\
    \ being monitored. The received data can also be\nrelayed to the analytical data\
    \ engines in the IoT cloud via a wired and wireless medium for\nfurther processing\
    \ and actions [13]. The resource-constrained WSN sublayer mainly uses\ndata-centric\
    \ protocols due to the SNs’ high deployment densities, high network dynamics,\n\
    and limited power supply of SNs. Although data-centric protocols are fragile and\
    \ not\nstandardized, they are more suitable than the high resource-demanding ID-based\
    \ IPv4 or\nIPv6 protocols in the addressing space of the WSN-based Agri-IoT.\n\

    \ WSN and IoT technologies into contextualized intelligent farm\nmanagement systems\
    \ to achieve higher event data quality and offer remote monitoring\nand control.\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT consists of the WSN sublayer, the gateways, the cloud\nservers,\
    \ and the remote interface application, as illustrated in Figures 3a and 5. Uniquely,\n\
    the current trends of Agri-IoT mandate that both intra-SN and BS–cloud communication\n\
    are based on low-power, ubiquitous, and freely available wireless standards [2].\
    \ Also,\nmost Agri-IoT solutions support bidirectional communications between\
    \ the BS/gateway\nand the cloud/users, whereby the BS updates the cloud/user database\
    \ and receives ac-\ntionable/control remote messages from the user or cloud analytical\
    \ decision results for\nactuation purposes. The WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most\
    \ dominant technology in the global\nsmart farming use cases in the agricultural\
    \ sector. The core tasks of SNs in a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT application, which are\
    \ frequently supervised by the associated routing protocol,\ninclude network construction/management,\
    \ data sensing, data processing/aggregation,\nfault tolerance, and communication\
    \ [9,12]. Also, the routing architecture must be supported\nby the associated\
    \ communication platform and the application-speciﬁc requirements of\nthe network.\n\

    \ WSN-based\nAgri-IoT requires holistic integrations of the expectations in Figure\
    \ 2.\n1.2. Classiﬁcations of IoT Applications and Speciﬁc Roles of Agri-IoT\n\
    Generally, IoT technology is application-speciﬁc. However, it has limitless applications\n\
    and roles in the smart world agenda. Based on their intended purpose, WSN-based\
    \ IoT sys-\ntems can be broadly classiﬁed into condition monitoring and event-tracking\
    \ categories [34],\nas illustrated in Figure 6.\nThe monitoring-based applications\
    \ involve real-time event data collection and analysis,\nsupervision, and operational\
    \ control of systems. In contrast, tracking-based applications\ntrack changes\
    \ in the phenomenon of interest, such as the locations of objects, persons,\n\
    transported goods, animals, and vehicles. Both application domains can be subdivided\n\
    into industrial, environmental, and societal IoT applications in Figure 6, where\
    \ speciﬁc\nexamples are provided for each application domain. For instance, monitoring-based\
    \ ap-\nplications may include indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [6], industrial\
    \ process\nmonitoring [5,29], process control [2], greenhouse automation [7],\
    \ precision agriculture\n(e.g., irrigation management, crop disease prediction,\
    \ prediction of production quality,\nIoT 2023, 4\n274\nand pest and disease control)\
    \ [2,8], biomedical or health monitoring [8], electrical grid net-\nwork monitoring/control\
    \ [12,29], military location monitoring [9], and so forth. Conversely,\nspecific\
    \ examples of tracking-based applications may include habitat tracking, traffic\
    \ tracking,\nplant/animal condition tracking, and military target tracking, as\
    \ outlined in Figure 6.\n1/21/22, 10:55 AM\n701.svg\nEcology: Wildlife Tracking\n\

    \ \nFigure 6. Generalized taxonomy of IoT applications.\n1.3. Agri-IoT Roles and\
    \ Use-Cases\nThe concept of intelligent farming involves data acquisition, data\
    \ processing/planning,\nand smart control using the WSN and IoT technologies,\
    \ big data, and cloud computing\ntechniques to provide proﬁtable solutions, as\
    \ presented in Figure 7. These principal roles\nin Figure 7 deﬁne their use cases.\
    \ For instance, monitoring the state of crops or the\nclimate of the ﬁeld using\
    \ Agri-IoT technology can allow farmers to know precisely the\namount of pesticides,\
    \ water, and fertilizers required to attain optimal crop quality and\nproduction\
    \ volume. However, the QoS requirements, the routing techniques, architectural\n\
    requirements, and the operational dynamics differ from one use case to another.\
    \ This\ntutorial focused on the critical and unique design requirements of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT,\nwhich is the backbone of the smart agricultural initiative [35].\
    \ The resulting use-cases in\nFigure 7 can be explained as follows:\n1.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Climate Condition or Agronomical Monitoring: This Agri-IoT system mostly\n\
    comprises BS (i.e., weather stations) and a deployed WSN. The analytical data\
    \ engines\nmine the sampled climate or crop condition data in the cloud to predict\
    \ future climate\nconditions and farm automation plans. The most suitable crop\
    \ and precise farming\npractices can then be predeﬁned to improve agriculture\
    \ production capacity and\nquality.\n2.\nAgri-IoT for Precision Farming: This\
    \ is the most famous application of Agri-IoT, whereby\nfarming practices (e.g.,\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer application, etc.) are precisely and accu-\nrately controlled\
    \ to optimize these resources. Here, the SNs are mostly ﬁtted with soil\nsensors\
    \ to collect a vast array of microclimatic data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and salinity) that can enable farmers to estimate optimal amounts of water, fertiliz-\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n275\ners, and pesticides needed by the crops to minimize resources’\
    \ costs and produce\nhealthier crops. Additionally, the BS controls the event\
    \ actuation system via accurate\ndata-driven real-time decisions on the crops\
    \ using climate data, crop growth data,\nand disease infection data.\n3.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Greenhouse Automation: The Agri-IoT-based approach provides more accu-\n\
    rate real-time information on greenhouse conditions, such as lighting, temperature,\n\
    soil condition, and humidity, unlike manual greenhouse management. This allows\n\
    precise remote monitoring and control or automation of all farming practices.\n\
    4.\nAgri-IoT for Livestock Monitoring and Management: In this system, SNs are\
    \ attached\nto livestock to monitor their real-time health, track their physical\
    \ location, and log\ntheir performance. This helps the farmer identify and isolate\
    \ sick animals to avoid\ncontamination and reduce stafﬁng expenses.\n5.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Predictive Analytics: This Agri-IoT system provides highly relevant real-\n\
    time data that can be analyzed to make essential predictions, such as crop harvesting\n\
    time, risk of disease infection, yield volume, yield quality, and yield vulnerability,\n\
    for proper planning.\n6.\nAgricultural Drones (Agri-Drones): Agri-Drones, such\
    \ as DroneSeed, are ﬁtted with\nmobile SNs and farming tools to collect agricultural\
    \ data or perform activities such\nas ﬁeld surveillance, crop planting, pest control,\
    \ farm spraying, crop monitoring, etc.\nFor example, for Agri-Drones, all the\
    \ above use cases utilize the WSN-based Agri-IoT\nframework.\n1/21/22, 11:01 AM\n\

    \ established that the existing real-world attempts of Agri-IoT could\nnot meet\
    \ both performance and user users’ expectations because they are founded on the\n\
    fundamental concepts and the operational principles of classic IoT and WSN technologies.\n\
    To effectively achieve the expectations in Figure 2, it is imperative to conduct\
    \ a systematic\nassessment of the related architectural layers in classic IoT\
    \ and propose a suitable option for\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem. Generally,\
    \ the conventional IoT ecosystem consists\nof the network architectural layers\
    \ and the data management platforms [2,7,8], which\nare further grouped into devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators, and gateways/BS), network (BS to\ncloud), platforms/applications’\
    \ cloud, and agents/users. Due to the domain-speciﬁc\nrequirements of IoT applications\
    \ and the incorporation of numerous heterogeneous devices\nIoT 2023, 4\n276\n\
    with application-speciﬁc requirements, there are generally no uniﬁed or standardized\n\
    IoT architectural layers. Therefore, most application-defined layers are frequently\
    \ adapted\nfrom the canon architectural layers, which include the three-layer\
    \ [5], the cloud-based [7],\nthe service-oriented architecture (SOA) [2,7], and\
    \ the fog-based [2,7,29], as illustrated in\nFigure 8.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n714.svg\n\

    \ in the state of the art of IoT ecosystem.\nThe fog-based architecture was adapted\
    \ from the three-layer parent architecture to in-\nclude cloud computing by offering\
    \ computing, storage, and network information between\nthe clients and the cloud\
    \ services [29] in a decentralized manner. Here, cloud computing\nand fog/edge\
    \ computing architectures only differ in where data computing occurs. These\n\
    layers are not uniﬁed because the respective network layers do not cover all underlying\n\
    technologies that transfer data to all IoT platforms [5]. Additionally, they are\
    \ based on com-\nplicated centralized and ﬂooding-based routing architectures,\
    \ high-resource-demanding\nand capital-intensive Wi-Fi/cellular-based communication\
    \ technologies. As well, they\nrequire wired infrastructural support in the farm,\
    \ which is too complex, location-restricted,\nand capital-intensive for most low-income\
    \ and non-expert farmers to implement and\nmanage. Consequently, they are unsuitable\
    \ candidates for the resource-constrained SNs\nin WSN-based Agri-IoT. By implication,\
    \ there are no reference guidelines for designing\nAgri-IoT participants and supervisory\
    \ protocols, controlling the speed of packet delivery,\nsmoothing out SN’s integration,\
    \ unifying technology, and creating standardized Agri-\nIoT reference models,\
    \ among other considerations. In contrast, an Agri-IoT ecosystem,\ndepicted in\
    \ Figure 3, consists of:\n1.\nAgri-IoT network architectural layers: This shows\
    \ how the physical network elements,\nnetwork operation principles, and operational\
    \ techniques interact throughout the\nentire ecosystem.\n2.\nNetwork supervisory\

    \ moderates all communications in the PHY layer.\n3.\nData management platform:\
    \ It hosts all high-resource-demanding data analytic en-\ngines, event databases,\
    \ and remote control algorithms in a cloud model.\n2.1. Proposed Architectural\
    \ Layers for WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nIn designing an efﬁcient Agri-IoT system of global\
    \ signiﬁcance, it is imperative to\npropose suitable architectural layers and\
    \ evaluate how the various components interact in\nthese layers. With the emerging\
    \ advances in low-power, freely available, and boundless\ncommunication standards\
    \ (e.g., BLE) and unfulﬁlled potentials of CA-IoT network [12,16],\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n277\na new framework of cluster-based architectural layers for the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT ecosys-\ntem is proposed in the left side of Figure 5. The center portion\
    \ of Figure 5 presents the key\ncomponents/technologies required in each layer,\
    \ while the Things taxonomies of hardware\ncomponents from the related literature\
    \ [4,8,29] are depicted on the right portion of Figure 5.\nThe underlying layers\
    \ in our four-tier layers in Figure 5 can be elaborated on as follows:\n1.\nIntegrated\
    \ Application and Management Layer: This operates all agriculture-related\napplications\
    \ that interface between the user (for example, farmer) and the Agri-IoT\nsystem\
    \ to make decisions and execute remote actions to keep their crops or animals\n\
    healthy. This layer manages the entire Agri-IoT system and its application-speciﬁc\n\
    functionality, high-resource-demanding applications, and core business model in\
    \ the\ncloud. This layer’s security requirements are crucial to the next sublayer;\
    \ however,\nthese are beyond the scope of this research. The business or management\
    \ sublayer\nmaintains end-to-end data integrity and security by ensuring that\
    \ data are transferred\nto the correct user. It also ensures that the correct\
    \ user executes the actuation.\n2.\nInformation Management Layer: This handles\
    \ data processing, storage, and other special-\nized cloud services and functionality\
    \ that make precise, actionable decisions. In Agri-\nIoT, the sensory data are\
    \ preprocessed locally to optimize communication power\nbut can be further processed\
    \ using analytic engines in the cloud for better decision\nmaking and remote monitoring\
    \ and control. This layer can be embedded in the above\napplication layers and\
    \ hosted in the cloud in a typical Agri-IoT ecosystem.\n3.\nNetwork Management\
    \ Layer: This layer discovers, connects, and translates devices over\na network,\
    \ and it coordinates with the above application layers. It also contains the\n\
    BS, which interfaces the resource-constrained WSN and cloud information network.\n\
    By convention, the WSN sublayer must utilize low-power communication standards\n\
    such as Zigbee, SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Z-Wave, SigFox, and IEEE P802.11ah (low-power\n\
    Wi-Fi), while the BS-to-Cloud connectivity can be achieved via the traditional\
    \ cellular\nnetworks, satellite networks, Wi-Fi, LAN, WAN, and LoRa, among others.\
    \ Unlike clas-\nsic IoT, Agri-IoT requires that the BS-to-Cloud connectivity utilize\
    \ low-power commu-\nnication standards. Also, since every communication standard\
    \ for the resource-limited\nWSN sublayer comes with unique resource speciﬁcations\
    \ and design tradeoffs be-\ntween power consumption, routing architectural constraints,\
    \ and bandwidth [4,14,17],\nthe best connectivity option must be selected to achieve\
    \ the desired application goals.\nConsequently, the stated WSN-based connectivity\
    \ technologies can be classiﬁed using\nseveral distinct parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption rates, uplink/downlink data\nrates, packet size, SN-count per BS\
    \ (gateway), network routing topology, the SNs’\nsensing range, the SNs’ transmitter/receiver\
    \ power, frequency bandwidth, channel\nwidth, etc. (refer to the right portion\
    \ of Figure 5).\n4.\nPhysical/Perception/Things Layer: This layer refers to the\
    \ ﬁeld and all devices such as\nSNs, actuators, RFID tags, sensors, and edge devices\
    \ that interact with the environment.\nThis layer senses and collects the necessary\
    \ information from the connected devices in\nthe WSN sublayer to the BS. In Agri-IoT\
    \ networks, the sampled microclimatic data\ncan be processed and stored on the\
    \ local BS, the cloud, or both. The activities in the\ncloud or application layers\
    \ are beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n2.2. Associated Hardware Components\
    \ and Technologies Required in the Proposed Architectural Layers\nTo precisely\
    \ model and design an Agri-IoT network of desired expectations (refer to\nFigure\
    \ 2) using the proposed architectural layers shown in Figure 5, the knowledge\
    \ of the\nprincipal components and technologies used in each of these layers and\
    \ how they interact\nand adapt for their intended functions is imperative. As\
    \ depicted in the middle of Figure 5,\nthe Agri-IoT ecosystem is composed of the\
    \ following core components/technologies:\n1.\nThings: The Things unit is the\
    \ physical interface between the tracked/monitored asset\nand the BS or actuator\
    \ controller, which aligns with the physical or perception layer. It\ncomprises\
    \ the monitored/tracked asset (for example, ﬁeld, crop, or animal), the SNs,\n\
    or the entire IoT devices making up the WSN (for example, SNs, actuators, IoT-enabled\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n278\ndevices, WSNs, and other smart devices), the event sampling,\
    \ and routing technology\nin the WSN. Since the SNs constituting this unit are\
    \ resource-constrained, freely\navailable communication standards such as Zigbee,\
    \ BLE, Z-Wave, and IEEE P802.11ah\n(low-power Wi-Fi) are the most suitable for\
    \ both SN–SN and SN–BS communications.\nThe Things unit accesses the cloud/Internet\
    \ via gateways (BS).\n2.\nGateway (BS): The BS interfaces the WSN out in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the applications situated\nin the cloud servers. This unit aligns with the\
    \ network management and actuator\ncontrol layer shown in the middle of Figure\
    \ 5. The WSN sublayer may have more\nthan one BS(s), each with the capacity to\
    \ handle most resource-demanding com-\nputational tasks besides actuation execution,\
    \ network construction, scheduling of\nevent sampling, and network supervision\
    \ services. They may also allow bidirectional\ncommunication with the cloud/user\
    \ and WSN. Similar to standalone IoT devices,\nthe BS can be equipped with 4G/5G/LTE/NB-IoT,\
    \ cellular-based, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN,\nor wired ethernet communication technologies\
    \ to interact with the cloud, and low-\npower communication standards such as\
    \ LoRa, low-power Wi-Fi, SIGFOX, UMTS,\nBLE, and Zigbee (Figure 5) to communicate\
    \ with the sensor ﬁeld. However, Agri-IoT\nnetworks require that both upper-layer\
    \ and lower-layer communication technolo-\ngies of the BS should be low-power,\
    \ freely available, easy to deploy and manage,\nand platform-independent. The\
    \ BS may preprocess or relay the raw data to the cloud\nfor remote data processing.\
    \ The BS(s) locations are strategically chosen to optimize\nnetwork communication\
    \ costs.\n3.\nIoT Cloud: The Cloud unit aligns with the applications layer. It\
    \ consists of an on-\npremises or remote server farm that hosts the applications\
    \ layer, event data analytic\nengines, security protocols, robust IoT applications,\
    \ user interface, and event database.\nThe high resource-demanding data-processing\
    \ tasks are mostly executed by well-\nequipped cloud-hosted applications to manage\
    \ and store huge amounts of data,\nprovide monitoring and data analytical services,\
    \ enable communication with devices,\nand manage information access. The merits\
    \ of edge computing can be exploited to\nensure that large amounts of data are\
    \ post-processed off-device to reduce the response\ntimes of the cloud.\n4.\n\
    User Interface: With the aid of a web or mobile app, the user or farmer can live-\n\
    monitor the farm’s conditions and execute control actions. Additionally, a presentation\n\
    or business intelligence layer may be added to coordinate the activities of non-technical\n\
    business users through dashboards and reports rather than with the application\n\
    layer itself.\n2.3. Quality Expectations of Agri-IoT’s Architectural Layers\n\
    Although there is no uniﬁed, certiﬁed, and ﬂexible Agri-IoT architecture layer,\
    \ any\nsuitable options deduced from the benchmarking architectures in Figure\
    \ 8 must satisfy\ncertain quality requirements, including:\n1.\nSimultaneous data\
    \ acquisition, analysis, and control from many sensors or actuators.\n2.\nMinimization\
    \ of huge raw data transmissions via data aggregation techniques to\nmaximize\
    \ actionable information quality.\n3.\nProvision of reliable network architecture\
    \ that supports energy-efﬁcient routing, sta-\nble connectivity, self-adaptability,\
    \ fault tolerance, operational simplicity/ﬂexibility,\nplatform independence,\
    \ affordability, and location independence of Agri-IoT designs.\n4.\nSupport for\
    \ automated/remote device management and updates.\n5.\nEasy integration of each\
    \ layer with existing applications and other IoT solutions via\nspeciﬁed APIs.\n\
    6.\nUtilization of freely available, location-unrestricted, cheap, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ and simple\nto deploy and manage by non-experts [4,29] underlying communication\
    \ technologies\nin the PHY and network layers as well as based on open standards\
    \ to guarantee\ninteroperability.\nIoT 2023, 4\n279\n3. Design and Implementation\
    \ of Agri-IoT Networks\nDespite the technical challenges associated with the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT, its potential\ncontributions in the agricultural sector largely surpass\
    \ the least complex, capital-intensive,\npure IoT-based solutions, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3b and 7. Due to the broader applicability\nand higher signiﬁcance\
    \ of the WSN-based Agri-IoT networks relative to the classic IoT\nnetworks, this\
    \ study focuses on the former technology whose design and implementation\ninvolve\
    \ four crucial phases, namely:\n1.\nCustom-building of robust, affordable, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ location-independent, and\nadaptive SNs and a BS that can form an infrastructure-less\
    \ and easily manageable WSN.\nThe SNs and the BS must consist of cost-effective,\
    \ architecture-deﬁned, and context-\ndeﬁned components so that the system operates\
    \ stably and efﬁciently, becomes afford-\nable to farmers, and easily integrates\
    \ to any real-world scenario without any expensive,\nﬁxed/wired backbone connections.\
    \ The low-power capabilities of the SNs help to\neasily integrate them into any\
    \ precision farms and greenhouses to operate over the\nentire crop season without\
    \ many technical hindrances.\n2.\nPhysical deployment of the SNs in the ﬁeld,\
    \ selection of the WSN’s communication\ntechnology, and design of a suitable supervisory\
    \ protocol to coordinate the construc-\ntion of appropriate event routing architecture,\
    \ the duty-cycle schedule of event sam-\npling to the BS, fault management, data\
    \ management, and network maintenance.\nAdditionally, a range of techniques such\
    \ as network participant mobility, cross-layer\ndesign, MAC techniques, data aggregation,\
    \ self-healing techniques, nodes’ duty-cycle\nschedule, security measures, localization,\
    \ and communication speciﬁcations of the\nSNs can also be exploited in the associated\
    \ routing protocols.\n3.\nSelection of appropriate BS/gateway communication technology\
    \ and design of a\nsuitable higher protocol to update the cloud database and execute\
    \ the actuation\nactions based on users’ requests or decisions on processed event\
    \ data.\n4.\nDesign of data analytical engines and applications in the cloud and\
    \ users’ remote\nmonitoring and control interface app, which is beyond the scope\
    \ of this tutorial.\nThese call for a systematic application-speciﬁc assessment\
    \ of the hardware components\nselected for every use case.\n3.1. Sensor Nodes\
    \ Design Considerations\nAs illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3, a node for\
    \ the WSN-based Agri-IoT network\nconsists of four main units, which include the\
    \ following:\n1.\nSensing Unit: This unit interfaces with the physical environment\
    \ and records the\nphysical phenomenon of interest. The type of sensor is application-speciﬁc\
    \ and can\nbe contact-based or non-contact-based. For instance, the STEMMA soil\
    \ moisture\nsensor and the DHT22 sensor can be used to sample environmental temperature\
    \ and\nhumidity (refer to Figure 3c).\n2.\nController Unit: This unit hosts the\
    \ processor, storage, and connection pins for the\nother units and all auxiliary\
    \ peripherals. The suitable controllers for building Agri-IoT\nSNs are Arduino-based\
    \ and Raspberry-Pi-based (refer to the bottom of Figure 3) due\nto their ability\
    \ to withstand extreme weather conditions. However, other off-the-shelf,\napplication-speciﬁc\
    \ controllers such as the ProPlant Seed Rate Controller, John Deere\nGreenStar\
    \ Rate Controller, Viper Pro multi-function ﬁeld computer, Radion 8140,\nTrimble\
    \ Field-IQ, etc. are also available.\n3.\nCommunication Unit: This unit is the\
    \ principal determinant of the node’s power\nconsumption, operational stability,\
    \ and affordability, as well as the routing architecture\nin the associated supervisory\
    \ protocol. The bottom of Figure 3 shows the available\ncommunication technologies,\
    \ but an Agri-IoT-based SN demands an energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, freely available,\
    \ simple, and reliable communication standard. Conse-\nquently, LoRa, BLE, ZigBee,\
    \ LoRaWan, and SigFox are the best candidates based on\nIoT 2023, 4\n280\nthe\
    \ support of the routing architecture of the resulting WSN, but the selection\
    \ must be\njustiﬁed from the technology requirement metrics via a decision matrix.\n\
    4.\nPower Unit: Since the SNs are mostly battery-powered, the appropriate battery\
    \ size\nand probable energy-harvesting techniques must be determined during the\
    \ SNs’\ndesign according to the intended network lifespan and stability requirements.\
    \ Modern\ntrends in battery power banks with integrated solar-based energy-harvesting\
    \ systems\nand power ratings above 30,000 Ah are available.\nWhen selecting hardware\
    \ components, adequate caution should be taken to avoid unit\nincompatibility,\
    \ high operational complexities, unsuitable operational thresholds, and high\n\
    energy consumption, among others. This implies that high component survivability\
    \ and op-\nerational stability under different environmental conditions and the\
    \ application speciﬁcities\nare vital to monitor.\n3.2. Wireless Spectrum and\
    \ Core Communication Platforms of WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nThe wireless electromagnetic\
    \ (EM) spectrum, which has invisible, ﬁnite radio fre-\nquencies for wireless\
    \ communication, can be licensed and sold exclusively by speciﬁc\nproviders or\
    \ unlicensed for free usage. For instance, the Industrial, Scientiﬁc, and Medical\n\
    (ISM) frequency band (e.g., Bluetooth classic, BLE, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LoRaWAN)\
    \ is an\nunlicensed microwave frequency band clustered around 2.4 GHz and globally\
    \ reserved for\napplications such as Agri-IoT. Table 3 presents the various bands\
    \ and their applications.\nA suitable candidate for a given Agri-IoT application\
    \ is based on several factors, such\nas communication and the route architectural\
    \ requirements, power consumption, cost,\nand environmental adaptability impacts.\n\

    \ SNs and Designing the Supervisory\nSampling/Routing Protocol\nAfter custom-building\
    \ or selecting off-the-shelf SNs, the next activity is to deploy\nthe SNs on the\
    \ ﬁeld and design a contextualized supervisory protocol to coordinate the\naforementioned\
    \ network’s activities. The SNs’ deployment in the ﬁeld can be either random\n\
    or deterministic. Both options require different methods to optimize the resulting\
    \ network’s\nperformance. For instance, under the deterministic approach, the\
    \ optimal parameters such\nas node uniformity and density must be predeﬁned based\
    \ on the distance thresholds of the\nassociated communication technology (i.e.,\
    \ connectivity/distance range), the SNs’ resource\noptimization mechanisms, the\
    \ type of routing architecture, and the sensing range of the\nphysical parameter\
    \ to be measured. Since communication is the principal power consumer,\nthe best\
    \ ways to conserve power are to minimize communication distance and data sizes\
    \ as\nwell as operate the SNs in the appropriate sleep–active duty cycles using\
    \ a cluster-based\nrouting architecture [9,24,26].\nBeyond the physical installation\
    \ of the SNs at their most suitable in-range locations,\nthe remaining activities,\
    \ such as network construction, event sensing, data management, FM,\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n281\nnetwork maintenance, sleep–active duty-cycle scheduling of SNs for sampling,\
    \ network adapt-\nability to turbulent and scalable conditions, power-optimization\
    \ mechanisms, and network\nreconfiguration, among others, are controlled by the\
    \ associated routing protocol [12,16,17,26,36].\nThis places crucial merits on\
    \ the physical locations of the SNs in the ﬁeld, thorough synthe-\nsis of network\
    \ design factors, and assessment of available routing architectures/techniques,\n\
    since this protocol manages all post-deployment tasks. This can be summarized\
    \ into\nthe core objectives of the routing protocol and its architecture, which\
    \ include power op-\ntimization, self-healing of any faults without the obstruction\
    \ of its normal operation,\nand self-adaptability to all turbulent and scalable\
    \ conditions. From the analysis above,\nwe can derive the critical primary factors\
    \ to consider when designing a routing protocol\nfor Agri-IoT networks, which\
    \ are presented in Figure 9 and grouped into the following\ncategories: SNs speciﬁcations,\
    \ security issues, application-speciﬁc factors, communication\nstandard compatibility\
    \ and capacities, and other auxiliary factors. At the PHY layer level,\nwhich\
    \ is the focus of this tutorial, these critical factors can translate into the\
    \ stipulated core\ndesign objectives, which can be addressed via phase-based multi-objective\
    \ optimization\n(MOO) formulation frameworks [12,23,24,37].\n1/21/22, 10:18 AM\n\

    \ 2023, 4\n283\nCost or Affordability of the Resulting Agri-IoT System: In addition\
    \ to being\ninfrastructure-less, ﬂexible, self-healing, adaptive, and energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT must consist of cost-effective hardware and software components\
    \ so that the\nsystem is affordable for farmers, since existing real-world solutions\
    \ are too expensive and\ncomplicated [1,14]. Additionally, the installation, operational,\
    \ and maintenance costs of\nthe resulting WSN-based Agri-IoT network must be kept\
    \ to a minimum so that it can be\neasily acquired.\nSecurity Issues in Agri-IoT:\
    \ Security is still a challenge in classic IoT systems that\nhandle sensitive\
    \ information, especially during cloud communications. Although Agri-\nIoT networks\
    \ lack the requisite resource capacities in most large-scale, broadcast-based,\n\
    distributed, and infrastructure-less WSN systems to achieve adequate data conﬁdentiality,\n\
    authenticity, integrity, and other security requirements, the security of the\
    \ agricultural\ndata is rarely a priority [2,4]. Nevertheless, the associated\
    \ routing architecture, such as\nthe clustering architecture, has an embedded\
    \ capacity to resolve on-site security issues.\nIn addition, both on-site and\
    \ remote information access types (e.g., via a smartphone or\ndesktop computer)\
    \ must be selected based on solid internal infrastructure and security\nprecautions\
    \ to secure unwanted access to sensitive information.\nThe Application-Speciﬁc\
    \ Factors: As indicated in Figure 9, the application-deﬁned\nfactors vary based\
    \ on the Agri-IoT application, the ﬁeld settings, network maintenance prac-\n\
    tices, intended event routing architecture, and network participants’ mobility,\
    \ among other\nfactors. However, the routing protocol must incorporate all relevant\
    \ operational efﬁciency\nfactors of the routing software design objectives. Since\
    \ the collected ﬁeld data itself cannot\nmake sense without using analytic data\
    \ engines and predictive algorithms in machine learn-\ning, the BS or the application\
    \ layer in the cloud should deﬁne appropriate data-processing\nframeworks to obtain\
    \ accurate, actionable decisions from the collected data.\nCommunication Standards\
    \ of Agri-IoT Devices: The power-constrained WSN sub-\nlayer of Agri-IoT network\
    \ places hard restrictions on operational states of SNs’ radio\ntransceivers,\
    \ code space, and processing cycles as well as memory capacities of SNs to\nenhance\
    \ power savings [9,12,23]. The type of communication technology selected for a\n\
    typical Agri-IoT is the principal predictor of its routing architecture, affordability,\
    \ simplicity,\nadaptability, power-saving capacity, location independence, self-healing\
    \ capacity, and event\ndata quality [12,16]. Consequently, power and routing architectural\
    \ limitations constrain\nthe network design requirements. Despite the aforementioned\
    \ technical challenges on\nthe network’s operational efﬁciency, interconnected\
    \ SNs that form the WSN are expected\nto withstand extra operational disruptions\
    \ caused by unfavorable weather conditions in\nthe ﬁeld [2,4]. Consequently, the\
    \ de facto PHY-layer communication standards for this\nlow-power, low bandwidth,\
    \ and distance-limited communication Agri-IoT devices/SNs\nhave been the energy-efﬁcient\
    \ platforms such as BLE, LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Also, a suit-\nable MAC technique\
    \ is imperative in the routing architecture to curb all channel access\nchallenges.\
    \ For instance, the ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard focuses on the physical and\n\
    the MAC layer speciﬁcations for WSNs, and it also supports the sleep–active or\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduled operation modes of SNs to enhance energy savings in centralized\
    \ or mesh-based\narchitectures. BLE does likewise in the highly endowed cluster-based\
    \ routing architecture.\nConsequently, Agri-IoT network designers must make the\
    \ most appropriate and critical de-\ncisions regarding the network’s communication\
    \ requirements when designing the routing\nprotocol. Using Table 4, WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT designers can make realistic design decisions\nregarding energy-efﬁcient\
    \ multihop routing, architectural requirements of routing proto-\ncol, bandwidth,\
    \ routing table capacities, total communication cost, and the desired MAC\ntechnique.\
    \ Additionally, the physical conditions within the agricultural environment such\n\
    as atmospheric dust concentration, physical obstruction to wireless signal transmissions,\n\
    and the terrain need to be considered.\nAuxiliary Factors and Available Software\
    \ Tool: Finally, the auxiliary factors can be\nnon-exhaustive depending on the\
    \ designer’s ﬁnancial capacity, user interface, information\nrequisition model,\
    \ cloud activities, operational expectations, and the available software\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n284\ntools. Additionally, an assortment of PHY-Layer design software\
    \ tools for Agri-IoT exper-\niments (thus, in both simulations and real-world\
    \ testbed deployments) that can be used\ninclude NS-3 [9,38], OMNeT++, MATLAB/Simulink\
    \ [9,12,39], Python [16], PAWiS [39],\nGloMoSim/QualNet [39,40], OPNET [12,39],\
    \ SENSE [37,39], J-Sim [39], Ptolemy II [39],\nShawn [9,39], and PiccSIM [12,39,41],\
    \ among others. The key features that are frequently\nconsidered when selecting\
    \ any of these software platforms include Python or MAT-\nLAB/Simulink compatibility\
    \ for software model and hardware prototype integration\nduring real-world operation,\
    \ compatibility with low-power communication standards\n(e.g., BLE, LoRa, ZigBee,\
    \ and SIGFOX), operating system support, programming lan-\nguage implementation,\
    \ the density of simultaneously simulated or ﬁeld-deployed SNs,\nco-simulation\
    \ with other hardware, documentation, easy access to upgraded versions,\nand installation\
    \ challenges [39]. MATLAB/Simulink and Python are the most commonly\nused experimental\
    \ tools, since these software tools are well-equipped with the stipu-\nlated features.\n\
    4. Unique Characteristics and Challenges of WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nUnlike the\
    \ traditional IoT, which generally relies on ﬁxed hardware to route network\n\
    trafﬁc, a WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT combines automated sensing, computation, actua-\n\
    tion, and wireless communication tasks into the SNs that are spatially distributed\
    \ across\nthe farm to autonomously form an infrastructure-less WSN [31]. A node\
    \ may perform\nadditional tasks such as local data processing (data aggregation),\
    \ network construction,\ndata redundancy, error control, data routing (e.g., in\
    \ multihop networks), and network\nmaintenance practices based on the network\
    \ size, application speciﬁcity, and associated\nrouting techniques. Also, the\
    \ WSN can be equipped to observe heterogeneous conditions\nsuch as temperature,\
    \ humidity, sound, color, location, light, vibration, and motion, using a\nwide\
    \ variety of sensors contained within a task-scalable SN. Therefore, assuming\
    \ that the\naccuracy and precision of event data in upper layers are preserved,\
    \ the Agri-IoT’s lifespan\nand its operational efﬁciency are rooted in the WSN’s\
    \ robustness. Thus, a deeper contextual\nexegesis into the design and maintenance\
    \ of this sublayer is imperative. As opposed to con-\nventional IoT and wireless\
    \ ad hoc communication networks, the operational efﬁciency of\nthe WSN sublayer,\
    \ as well as Agri-IoT, hinge upon some application-speciﬁc characteristics\nand\
    \ resource-constrained factors such as:\n•\nHigher SN Deployment Densities: Generally,\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in either a deter-\nministic or random manner to provide\
    \ the desired redundancies, spatial variability of\nsoil, topography, distributed\
    \ monitoring and processing, accurate and precise event\nreporting, and fault\
    \ tolerance. However, this mostly leads to undesirable transmission\noverlaps,\
    \ data redundancies from the simultaneous reporting of the same data, routing\n\
    interferences, and packet collisions due to connectivity issues and the coexistence\
    \ of\ncommon standards in the ISM band [42].\n•\nLimited Power Supply: The SNs\
    \ are frequently battery-powered, which does not only\nconstrain their data transmission\
    \ rate, computational capabilities, and communication\ndistance but also subjects\
    \ Agri-IoT to possible SN-out-of-service and data outlier\nfaults due to rapid\
    \ power depletion beyond certain thresholds [26,43]. Consequently,\nnetwork power\
    \ management through data-management-related, architectural-related,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters has been one of the principal research focuses\nin WSN-based IoT\
    \ applications to improve network lifetime.\n•\nFault Management (FM) (i.e., fault\
    \ detection, fault tolerance, or fault avoidance): The\nresource-constrained WSN\
    \ is highly vulnerable to faults and failures due to high\ndeployment densities\
    \ and a lack of post-deployment maintenance services [25]. Al-\nthough faults\
    \ are inevitable in Agri-IoT for the stipulated reasons, their occurrence\nrates\
    \ and effects on the network’s functionality can be minimized, avoided, or tolerated\n\
    without hindering the normal functionality of the network if the associated WSN’s\
    \ rout-\ning protocol is well-equipped with efﬁcient self-healing and fault-avoidance\
    \ (power-\nsaving) mechanisms [12].\nIoT 2023, 4\n285\n•\nSelf-Adaptability and\
    \ Scalability: Although WSNs are application-speciﬁc, the topologi-\ncal dynamism\
    \ is inevitable due to node failures, node mobility, and scalable conditions.\n\
    Therefore, the associated routing protocol and network architecture must adapt\
    \ to\nthese dynamic conditions using apt auto-reconﬁguration and reactive multihop\
    \ event\nrouting techniques [44,45].\n•\nNetwork Architecture: The underlying\
    \ routing protocol of the WSN sublayer constructs\na network architecture that\
    \ can be ﬂat, hierarchical (e.g., clustering, chain-based,\nand tree architectures)\
    \ or location-based. This routing architecture prescribes the\npossible measures\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient local data processing, network maintenance,\nscalability,\
    \ minimized communication overhead, prolonged network lifespan, and re-\nduced\
    \ network management complexities [25,36]. Therefore, a suitable network\ntopology\
    \ indirectly determines the resulting network’s ﬂexibility, scalability, reliability,\n\
    communication strategy/costs, and the quality of the reported event data [12].\n\
    •\nMostly Requires On-site Actuation: Regardless of where data are managed in\
    \ a typical\nWSN-based Agri-IoT, the actionable decision signal must be sent to\
    \ execute on-farm\nactuation.\nProposed Design Objectives of WSN-Based Routing\
    \ Protocols for Agri-IoT and\nRealization Mechanisms\nFrom the systematic evaluation\
    \ of the unique characteristics and challenges of the\nWSN sublayer, a three-tier\
    \ cluster-based framework that constitutes the condensed ex-\npected core design\
    \ objectives and their corresponding remedial strategies of WSN-based\nrouting\
    \ protocols for Agri-IoT applications is demonstrated in Figure 10. Suppose the\
    \ corre-\nsponding remedies in Figure 10 are implemented in the associated routing\

    \ and strategies of WSN-based Agri-IoT routing protocols.\nThe importance of this\
    \ three-tier framework can be expanded on as follows:\n•\nAn adaptive and scalable\
    \ WSN-based routing protocol, as proposed in Figure 10, normally\nconstructs a\
    \ routing architecture that supports multihop routing, self-reconfiguration,\n\
    self-healing, and local network administration at a minimal routing table size,\
    \ commu-\nnication cost, and and control message complexity requirement. Since\
    \ communication\nIoT 2023, 4\n286\nis the principal power consumer, the operation\
    \ of the routing protocol must invlove\nfewer control messages. Also, it must\
    \ adapt to network turbulence due to SN failures.\nThe cluster-based architecture\
    \ exhibits the highest potential compared to related ar-\nchitectures [9,16,17,26].\
    \ The cluster heads (CHs) efﬁciently coordinate these activities\nby registering\
    \ and tolerating all dynamism resulting from SN-out-of-service faults,\nincreasing\
    \ the network size and SN density.\n•\nDue to the high vulnerability of SNs to\
    \ faults and failures, it is imperative to deploy\nsuitable FM techniques that\
    \ can detect, tolerate, or avoid possible root faults such\nas SN-out-of-service\
    \ and data outliers [25]. The adaptive clustering approach can\neffectively resolve\
    \ SN-out-of-service faults, while the threshold-based decision theory\nat the\
    \ local nodes and global levels can be suitable candidates for event data outlier\n\
    detection and correction in the PHY layer. Since power mismanagement is the root\n\
    cause of most faults and failures, the best fault-avoidance techniques optimize\
    \ the\nnodes’ power consumption rates.\n•\nFigure 10 also outlines the suitable\
    \ measures for power optimization in the WSN\nsublayer of Agri-IoT. In clustering\
    \ approaches, power consumption in the constrained\nWSN can be managed via message\
    \ complexity control, connectivity-related metrics,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters by exploiting the clustering architecture [46].\nIn addition to local\
    \ data processing (data aggregation, data redundancy, and error\nchecks) and local\
    \ network administration (FM, adaptability to network dynamics),\nsuitable MOO\
    \ and multihop routing frameworks can be derived using the clustering\narchitecture,\
    \ total communication cost, and optimal cluster quality metrics to serve as\n\
    a design optimization guide for the simulation and real-world implementations\
    \ of the\nWSN phase of Agri-IoT.\nTo achieve the expectations in Figure 10, there\
    \ is a need for an architecture-speciﬁc\nmulti-objective assessment of the WSN’s\
    \ design cycle; from this, the associated parameters\nand theoretical models can\
    \ be derived and then theoretically optimized and validated\nexperimentally. A\
    \ novel holistic MOO framework can help realize these expected goals in\nboth\
    \ simulation and real-world Agri-IoT implementations. Consequently, there exists\
    \ the\nneed to carry out a systematic survey and assessment on existing routing\
    \ architectures, FM\nschemes, and routing protocols, and how these evolved in\
    \ existing real-world realization\ntestbeds of Agri-IoT. Such an in-depth literature\
    \ synthesis can help assess these qualitative\nperformance indicators constituting\
    \ the root QoS metrics in Figure 10 as well as deduce\napplication-speciﬁc guidelines\
    \ for improving CA-IoT networks using a precision irrigation\nsystem as a case\
    \ study.\n5. State of the Art on Routing Protocols for WSN-Based Agri-IoT Applications\n\
    In Agri-IoT, it is not simply a matter of applying IoT to a farm; contextual due\
    \ diligence\non architecture, communication standard, cost, actuator, performance\
    \ stability, control,\nand environmental impacts augment the routing protocol\
    \ requirements. This section\npresents a systematic synthesis of WSN-applicable\
    \ routing protocols under network ar-\nchitecture, the route discovery process,\
    \ and protocol operation as illustrated in Figure 11.\nTo help Agri-IoT designers\
    \ make well-informed decisions concerning architectural selection,\nwe classiﬁed\
    \ the canon protocols based on routing architecture, route-discovery process,\n\
    and operations in order to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and contextual\
    \ reasons why\nthey can be adopted for Agri-IoT applications. Generally, event\
    \ routing in every protocol\ncan either be source-initiated or destination-initiated,\
    \ and the optimal path selection from\nthe constructed routing architecture can\
    \ also be broadcast-based, probabilistic, cluster-\nbased, or parameter-determined\
    \ using location-related, weight-based, and content-based\nmetrics [13]. Also,\
    \ routing protocols must commonly resist link failures using mechanisms\nthat\
    \ ensure balanced network-wide power depletion rates, energy-efﬁcient multihop\
    \ rout-\ning, and effective implementation of the indispensable QoS metrics presented\
    \ in Figure 10.\nThe related routing protocols can be classiﬁed as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 11.\nIoT 2023, 4\n287\nfile:///C:/Users/emman/Downloads/704.svg\n\

    This class of protocols presented in Figures 11 and 12 can be sub-grouped into\
    \ ﬂat-\nbased centralized or direct communication and decentralized [47] (e.g.,\
    \ ﬂooding/peer-\nto-peer/graphical/mesh-like architectures), hierarchical/cluster-based/tree\

    \ Sample network architectures: centralized-data-centric, cluster-based, and graph/ﬂooding-\n\
    based architectural frameworks of WSN sublayer.\nIoT 2023, 4\n288\nThe centralized\
    \ protocols route data to the BS via single-hop routing, while the ﬂooding\nand\
    \ graph-based protocols ﬂood data through multihop routing. The graph-based routing\n\
    protocols construct a reactive or proactive graphical routing architecture with\
    \ G(V, E)\nwhere a node and path represent the vertex and edges, respectively.\
    \ This method relies\non resource-intensive routing techniques from graph theory\
    \ used in classic IoT and ad\nhoc networks to transmit event data to the BS. In\
    \ contrast, the clustering/tree topology\ndepicted in Figure 12 groups the SNs\
    \ into either static or dynamic clusters, each with an\noptimally selected CH\
    \ to minimize the communication distances of the cluster’s member\nnodes (MN).\
    \ The CH is then tasked with aggregating the received readings from its MNs,\n\
    executing error and measurement redundancy checks, and communicating directly\
    \ (single-\nhop routing) or via a relay CH (RCH) using a multihop routing technique\
    \ to the sink\nnode or BS. However, the RCHs must be assigned fewer MNs to balance\
    \ the network’s\npower depletion rates, since aggregated packet forwarding inﬂicts\
    \ extra energy burden\non the RCHs [37]. Additionally, the CH can be equipped\
    \ to perform extra roles such as\nFM, coordination of the reclustering process,\
    \ network maintenance, relaying of aggregated\npackets in large-scale networks,\
    \ and management of network dynamism [12]. In general,\ncluster-based routing\
    \ protocols differ in terms of CH selection methods and coincide in\nterms of\
    \ intra-cluster and inter-cluster multihop routing, local data processing by the\
    \ CHs,\nand CH role rotation [47], which ensure balanced network-wide power depletion,\
    \ prevent\nabrupt power exhaustion, and lead to exponential energy savings [37].\n\
    Although the ﬂat-based architectures, such as centralized and ﬂooding (see Figure\
    \ 12),\ncan be easily implemented in real-world small-scale Agri-IoT networks,\
    \ they suffer severe\npacket collisions, communication bottlenecking at the BS,\
    \ and high inaptness for scalable\nor turbulent large-scale WSNs where energy\
    \ efﬁciency is a priority. Again, an optimized\nclustering approach can provide\
    \ an ideal topology for addressing the proposed expectations\nin Figure 10, and\
    \ it can also offer extra beneﬁts such as minimized communication cost,\nstabilized\
    \ network topology, efﬁcient load management, improved network maintenance,\n\
    and improved network trafﬁc and channel access management [37,48]. The main challenge\n\
    of the clustering method is how to achieve the desired cluster quality (e.g.,\
    \ optimal cluster\ncount and cluster size) so that the computational, bandwidth,\
    \ memory, and routing table\ncapacities of the resource-constrained CHs are not\
    \ exceeded. Typical examples of clustering\nprotocols are the LEACH family of\
    \ protocols, which include RCEEFT, ESAA, DEEC, SEP,\nand PEGASIS in [12].\nIn\
    \ location-based routing architectures, routing decisions are made either reactively\n\
    (e.g., Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector—AODV) or proactively (e.g., RPL—Routing\n\
    over Low-Power and Lossy Networks protocol), using the SNs’ location information.\
    \ This\nnormally results in a decentralized, graphical architecture. Since the\
    \ SNs that form the\nWSN are spatially deployed in the ﬁeld without any IP-addressing\
    \ schemes, location\ninformation is needed in order to establish communication\
    \ between the nodes in a location-\nbased architecture. The location information\
    \ helps eliminate unwanted transmissions by\ncollecting data from a speciﬁc region\
    \ of interest. This architecture suffers from routing\ndelays, high infrastructural\
    \ cost, extreme difﬁculties in deployment and management,\nand high energy waste\
    \ due to SNs’ long idling durations. However, they are the most\ncommonly used\
    \ protocol in existing ZigBee-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1,10,14,17].\n\
    Since this approach yields non-energy-aware architectures, it is not suitable\
    \ for Agri-IoT\napplications [12].\nIt is evident from the above discussions that\
    \ Agri-IoT-based network architectures\nmust be deﬁned by the associated routing\
    \ protocol using the design requirements in Figure 9\nas well as the application-deﬁned\
    \ requirements [49] in order to enhance the performance\nexpectations in Figure\
    \ 10. In addition, the routing architecture must not compromise on\nthe quality,\
    \ precision, and accuracy of the event information. It must be in unison with\
    \ the\napplication-speciﬁc requirements to address possible deployments- and network-induced\n\
    challenges, such as network turbulence and SN mobility.\nIoT 2023, 4\n289\n5.2.\
    \ Route Discovery-Based Protocols\nAs shown in Figure 11, route discovery-based\
    \ protocols focus on when the route for\ndata transmission is built and can be\
    \ grouped into proactive, reactive, and hybrid protocols.\nIn proactive routing\
    \ protocols, the routes are pre-created before they are needed.\nThese protocols\
    \ are table-driven, since every node stores a large routing table containing a\n\
    list of all possible destinations, next-hop neighbors to those destinations, and\
    \ the associated\ncosts of all next-hop options. Proactive protocols such as the\
    \ RPL and the APTEEN family of\nprotocols [15] make local routing decisions using\
    \ the routing table’s content. For instance,\nthe RPL operates as a distant-vector\
    \ protocol for IPv6 low-power devices, utilizes the\nZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard\
    \ on established IP infrastructure, and also supports the\n6LoWPAN adaptation\
    \ layer. RPL creates a multihop tree routing hierarchy of SNs, such\nthat nodes\
    \ can send data through their respective parent nodes to the BS/sink node in a\n\
    ﬂooded manner (Figure 12). Similarly, the BS or sink node can send a unicast message\
    \ to a\nspeciﬁc SN in order to complete a bidirectional operational framework\
    \ of RPL. The optimal\ncommunication costs and routes are estimated by ranking\
    \ the associated objective function\n(OF) metrics, which can be single-objective\
    \ optimization, SOO metrics, or MOO metrics.\nThis routing over LLNs (RoLL) restricts\
    \ densely deployed and resource-limited SNs to\ncommunicate using peer-to-peer\
    \ or extended star network topologies [13]. Technically,\nRPL builds a directed\
    \ acyclic graph (DAG) with no outgoing edges from the root element\n(e.g., BS)\
    \ to eliminate loops. RPL is the primary underlying routing protocol in most failed\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed attempts. Although the proactive or RPL-based family of protocols\
    \ are\nrobust, reliable, scalable, and can relatively operate at minimized control\
    \ messages with the\nhelp of timers, they are not suitable for Agri-IoT networks\
    \ due to these technical challenges:\n•\nThe core of RPL/proactive protocols still\
    \ suffers from key challenges such as en-\nergy wastage, a lack of adaptability/scalability,\
    \ reliability, congestion, and security\nissues. Speciﬁcally, the energy expended\
    \ by RPL-inherited protocols to create routes\n(e.g., establish and maintain routing\
    \ tables) and transmit data can be too high for\nresource-constrained SNs in recent\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n•\nThe underlying technology of RPL (e.g., ZigBee, 6LoWPAN,\
    \ or IPv6) was designed\nfor energy-sufﬁcient devices with high processing and\
    \ memory capacities. Therefore,\nRPL is inapt for typical resourced-constrained\
    \ Agri-IoT networks (refer to Table 5).\n•\nThey require costly ﬁxed IP infrastructural\
    \ supports and utilize the centralized routing\narchitecture, which becomes practically\
    \ impossible to manage as the network scales.\nConversely, the source-initiated\
    \ reactive or on-demand routing protocols only create\nthe routes on-demand by\
    \ a source to send data to a receiver. Reactive protocols (e.g., Ad hoc\nOn-demand\
    \ Distance Vector, AODV Protocol [13]) have no speciﬁc procedures for creating\n\
    and updating routing tables with route information at regular intervals. For instance,\n\
    the AODV is a loop-free, self-starting, and reactive routing protocol meant for\
    \ LLNs\n(e.g., WSN-based IoT) that are characterized by node mobility, link failures,\
    \ and packet\nlosses. AODV mainly consists of the route discovery process (RREQ\
    \ and RREP messages)\nand route maintenance (RERR and HELLO messages). Although\
    \ reactive or AODV-based\nprotocols can adapt to network dynamics and eliminate\
    \ periodic updates, the associated\nﬂooding-based route–search process incurs\
    \ severe overheads resulting in high control\nmessage complexity, high route acquisition\
    \ latency, and high energy wastages due to longer\nSN idling periods. Consequently,\
    \ these protocols are unsuitable for power-constrained\nWSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n\
    The hybrid-based routing protocols merge the features of both reactive and proactive\n\
    routing processes. However, hybrid protocols such as APTEEN [13] also require\
    \ expensive\nﬁxed infrastructural support, which renders them unsuitable for Agri-IoT,\
    \ even if the\ncombined merits of reactive and proactive protocols are exploited.\n\
    A comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the parent WSN-based\n\
    routing protocols for Agri-IoT applications is illustrated in Table 5.\nIoT 2023,\

    \ protocols can be classiﬁed based on the operation or communication\nmodel employed,\
    \ which may include:\n•\nNegotiation-Based Protocols: These protocols exchange\
    \ negotiation messages or use\nmeta-data negotiations between neighboring SNs\
    \ before the actual data transfers to\nreduce redundant transmissions in the network.\
    \ A typical example is the SPIN family\nof protocols [13].\n•\nMultipath-Based\
    \ Protocols: These use multiple routes simultaneously to accomplish\nhigher resilience\
    \ to route failure (i.e., fault tolerance) and load balancing.\n•\nQuery-Based\
    \ Routing Protocols: These are receiver-initiated protocols whereby a desti-\n\
    nation node broadcasts a query to initiate a data-sensing task from a node through\
    \ the\nnetwork. A node having the data being queried sends it in response to the\
    \ query.\n•\nCoherent and Non-Coherent Protocols: The coherent routing method\
    \ forwards data for\naggregation after a minimum local pre-processing. However,\
    \ in non-coherent routing,\nthe nodes locally process the raw data before routing\
    \ to the BS for further processing.\n•\nQoS-Based Routing Protocols: These protocols’\
    \ purpose is to satisfy a speciﬁc QoS metric\nor multiple QoS metrics such as\
    \ low latency, energy efﬁciency, or low packet loss.\nThese protocols ensure a\
    \ balance between energy consumption and data quality in\nevery event-reporting\
    \ task.\nIn addition to route architectural construction and data transmission,\
    \ efﬁcient MAC\nmust be embedded in the routing protocol to manage the wireless\
    \ medium access and the\nduty-cycle/sampling schedules of the deployed SNs in\
    \ Agri-IoT networks. As opposed\nto classic IoT, the MAC techniques in Agri-IoT\
    \ are architecture-deﬁned by the associated\nrouting protocol to meet the energy\
    \ efﬁciency requirements of the network via channel\naccess management (CAM) and\
    \ the moderation of the active–sleep duty cycles of the\ndeployed SNs to save\
    \ extra energy. The next subsection presents a concise overview of\nMAC techniques\
    \ and their roles in WSN-based Agri-IoT networks.\n5.4. MAC Techniques and Requirements\
    \ for Agri-IoT\nNext to node deployment, the routing protocol deﬁnes the network\
    \ architecture and\nselects a suitable MAC technique and a communication pattern\
    \ for the routing architec-\nture. Unlike classic IoT, requirements for Agri-IoT\
    \ applications include a low control\nIoT 2023, 4\n291\nmessage complexity and\
    \ low latency MAC technique that moderates sampling schedules,\naccess to a shared\
    \ medium, transceiver operation modes, (e.g., packet transmission and\nreception,\
    \ retransmission, collision, over-hearing, overhead handling, and idle listening)\n\
    active–sleep duty cycles of the deployed SNs, and transceiver channels. Thus,\
    \ an MAC\nprotocol for WSN-based Agri-IoT applications must be architecture-speciﬁc\
    \ and adaptive\nto network dynamics such as data transmission errors, interferences/packet\
    \ collisions,\nand regular interfacing of the active–sleep duty-cycled schedules\
    \ of the SNs’ transceiver\nstates (e.g., transmitting state, receiving state,\
    \ idle state, and sleep state [52]) during packet\ntransmission and reception\
    \ in order to improve network throughput, energy efﬁciency,\nlatency, and other\
    \ QoS metrics.\nUnlike MAC protocols for classic IoT, an efﬁcient MAC technique\
    \ for Agri-IoT must\nensure exponential energy savings via channel assignment\
    \ management (CAM) and active–\nsleep duty-cycle coordination in both time and\
    \ channel perspectives. Based on these\ncommon dual tasks of Agri-IoT-based MAC\
    \ (thus, duty-cycle optimization—DCO and\nchannel access management—CAM), existing\
    \ IoT-based MAC techniques can be classiﬁed\nas illustrated in Figure 13 and the\

    \ surveyed core Agri-IoT-based routing protocols and evalu-\nated the parent protocols\
    \ (i.e., RPL, AODV, and LEACH/cluster-based families of protocols)\nfor classic\
    \ WSN-based IoT networks, of which LEACH-based methods are the best candi-\ndates\
    \ for the resource-limited WSN-based Agri-IoT. However, the RPL and AODV have\n\
    received more research considerations in terms of realizations in both simulations\
    \ and prac-\ntice [9,12,21]. Although the cluster-based architecture has unique\
    \ endowments for realizing\nthe proposed expectations in Figures 2 and 10, it\
    \ lacks an in-depth design synthesis in the\ncurrent state of the art that can\
    \ uncover its contextualized performance optimization modal-\nities for real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT applications. In addition, the deployment requirements with\ntrending\
    \ technologies such as BLE, LoRaWAN, SigFox, 5G, LoRa via Satellite, and NB-IoT\n\
    under both simulation and real-world operational conditions is imperative. Consequently,\n\
    the following sections present in-depth overviews on FM, the benchmarking of WSN-based\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed solutions, clustering methods in the existing state of the art,\
    \ and how\nthe possible deductions from these syntheses can evolve in a typical\
    \ case-study such as a\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT routing protocol for precision irrigation.\n\
    6. State of the Art on FM Techniques for Classic WSN Sublayer of IoT\nSince faults\
    \ and failures are inevitable in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks (refer\n\
    to Figure 10), it is imperative to reevaluate the faults, causes, types, strengths/weaknesses\n\
    of existing FM (i.e., fault detection—FD, fault tolerance—FT, and fault-avoidance—FA)\n\
    schemes, revisit their founding assumptions [71], and make appropriate recommendations\n\
    for Agri-IoT network designers. In this section, we establish the root source/cause(s)\
    \ of\nfaults in the WSN sublayer by assessing the behaviors of the different fault\
    \ types, examining\nthe extent to which the existing FM schemes address these\
    \ root faults, and exploring\nhow these schemes will evolve in realistic WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT networks based on their\ncore assumptions, control message overheads/complexities,\
    \ and energy-saving capacities.\nFrom this thorough assessment, this section proposes\
    \ practical fault-avoidance-based FM\ntechniques for the next generation of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT.\n6.1. Systematic Overview of Faults, Sources, and Taxonomy of Faults\
    \ in Agri-IoT\nAccording to the fault–error–failure cycle depicted in Figure 14,\
    \ a fault can be defined as\nany impairment that causes a system to produce erroneous\
    \ results or leads to the failure of the\nentire system or specific components\
    \ [72]. The prevalence of faults in WSN-based Agri-IoT\nis primarily due to the\
    \ SN component malfunction, lack of post-deployment maintenance,\nor resource\
    \ exhaustion [73], which can lead to either impaired event data quality (thus,\
    \ sensory\ndata error/outlier) or SN-out-of-service (thus, the shortened lifespan\
    \ of SNs) [25].\nDue to the high susceptibility of WSNs to faults, the supervisory\
    \ routing protocol is\nexpected to incorporate efﬁcient FM mechanisms that can\
    \ guarantee optimum event data\nquality and network availability. By implication,\
    \ FM algorithms for WSNs must not be\nstand-alone as currently seen in the state\
    \ of the art [73]; instead, they must be an integral\naspect of the routing protocol\
    \ that agrees with the core participants of the PHY layer, such as\nthe SN, wireless\
    \ communication medium, and the BS. As illustrated on the left of Figure 15,\n\
    the WSN sublayer is the most prevalent source of faults in the Agri-IoT ecosystem,\
    \ in which\nthe SNs are the central origin of faults that can propagate to the\
    \ upper layers [25,43,73].\nThis is because the BS is resource-sufﬁcient mainly,\
    \ and the link’s reliability also hinges\nupon the SNs’ availability, as indicated\
    \ in Figure 15. At the local SN’s level, each unit\ndepicted at the bottom of\
    \ Figure 3 is a potential source of fault/failure, but the degree of\nprevalence\
    \ is frequently accelerated whenever power consumption is mismanaged through\n\
    the disregard of any of the network design requirements and deployment conditions\n\
    presented in later sections.\nThe different taxonomies of faults in the state\
    \ of the art of the WSN sublayer [44,71,73–77],\nas illustrated on the left side\
    \ of Figure 16, can be compared as follows:\nIoT 2023, 4\n295\n•\nHard or permanent\
    \ fault refers to the inability of a node to stay active and communicate\ndue\
    \ to resource exhaustion or component malfunction, while in soft or static faults,\n\
    nodes continue to work and communicate with other nodes, but they sense, process,\n\
    or transmit erroneous data [44,74].\n•\nThe authors in [75,78] categorized faults\
    \ as permanent (refers to SN-out-of-service\nfaults), transient (caused by temporary\
    \ conditions), intermittent (shows sporadic\nmanifestations due to unstable behavior\
    \ of hardware and software), and potential\n(due to depletion of hardware resources\
    \ [78]).\n•\nData inconsistency faults can also result from faulty sensing, processing,\
    \ and communi-\ncation, which is frequently caused by power depletion below a\
    \ certain threshold, while\npower failure occurs when a node exhausts its battery\
    \ power completely [43,77,79].\n•\nThe authors in [73] classiﬁed faults into software\
    \ and hardware faults based on soft-\nware and hardware impairments, respectively.\n\
    •\nAccording to [71], faults can be either time-based, due to the depreciation\
    \ of hardware\ncomponents with time, or behavioral-based, due to SNs’ inability\
    \ to cope with harsh\nenvironmental and operating conditions.\n1/20/22, 8:48 PM\n\

    \ in the state of the art and proposed fault taxonomies for WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT.\n\
    From the above deﬁnitions and the fault taxonomies on the left side of Figure\
    \ 16, it can\nbe deduced that hard, permanent, and static faults are practically\
    \ manifested as SN-out-of-\nservice, while soft, dynamic, and data-inconsistency\
    \ faults can be observed as data outliers.\nBoth SN-out-of-service and data outliers\
    \ are consequences of unit malfunction or resource\nexhaustion and can be permanent\
    \ or intermittent in behavior. Both conditions can impair\nthe quality of event\
    \ data and the global actionable decisions of the network. Therefore,\nthe quality\
    \ of FM schemes can be evaluated based on their capacities to effectively detect,\n\
    tolerate, or avoid SN-out-of-service and data outlier faults. In summary, most\
    \ FM schemes\nin the state of the art focus on their effects, instead of the root\
    \ faults, which are the ﬂaws in\nexisting FM schemes [25]. Additionally, since\
    \ the SN is the sole network device responsible\nIoT 2023, 4\n297\nfor event sensing,\
    \ data computation, packet forwarding, and communication in the WSN\nsublayer\
    \ of Agri-IoT, it is the principal source of faults in Agri-IoT networks. A new\
    \ fault\nclassiﬁcation framework shown in Figure 16 can be deduced from the above\
    \ analysis.\nSecondly, it is discernible that SNs’ power mismanagement is the\
    \ most prevalent\norigin of faults [43,80,81], which then propagate to the backend\
    \ or application level (refer\nto the right side of Figure 15). For instance,\
    \ communication, sensing, and computational\naccuracies of a node can be impaired\
    \ when the battery energy falls below certain thresh-\nolds [43]. Also, network\
    \ faults can be traced to power exhaustion and node failures, which\ncreate holes\
    \ in the topology that divide the network into multiple disjointed segments [43].\n\
    On that account, faults can be avoided in WSN-based Agri-IoT if the energy-saving\
    \ strate-\ngies presented in Figures 9 and 10 are effectively implemented.\nAdditionally,\
    \ any FM scheme or fault-monitoring mechanism, be it proactive, reactive,\npassive,\
    \ or active, must incorporate the following underlying qualities: thresholds that\n\
    represent the probable fault conditions without false alarms, fault discovery,\
    \ minimized\nmessage/time complexities, and self-healing and self-reconﬁguration\
    \ to neutralize the\neffects of the faults [43].\nFM Framework and Architectures\
    \ in WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nAs illustrated in Figure 17, every FM scheme consists\
    \ of three main steps, which\ninclude fault detection (FD), fault diagnosis, and\
    \ fault recovery/tolerance (FT) [82,83],\nwhich always require input information.\
    \ These steps are implemented in a decision-making\nframework that involves four\
    \ major processes: data/information collection, FD model\nformulation, FD decision\
    \ and fault classiﬁcation, and tolerance of its effects using any of\nthe FT mechanisms\
    \ shown in Figure 17. Thus, the FD model detects the fault, the fault\ndiscovery\
    \ technique distinguishes that fault from false alarms, while the FT mechanism\n\
    helps to auto-heal and recover from the faults or failures [84]. Mainly, SN-out-of-service\n\
    faults are detected and tolerated using self-reconﬁguration techniques, whereas\
    \ data outlier\nfaults must strictly follow Figure 17.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n4.svg\n\

    Figure 17. FM framework in WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT.\nIn addition, FM schemes\
    \ can be implemented using either a centralized or distributed\narchitecture [44,85,86].\
    \ In a centralized scheme, the FD/FT protocol is hosted and managed\non the BS,\
    \ whereas the distributed scheme hosts and manages this algorithm on the local\n\
    SNs [87,88] (see Figure 17). The centralized approach is simpler for small-scaled\
    \ networks\nbut suffers many technical challenges, such as common point failure\
    \ due to heavy message\ntrafﬁc at the BS and high SN energy waste. In contrast,\
    \ the distributed approach saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc on the BS\
    \ because it allows local decision and self-\nIoT 2023, 4\n298\nFD/FT with or\
    \ without neighboring. According to Figure 17, the distributed architecture\n\
    can be implemented in three major ways [43,89–91], which include self-detection,\
    \ neighbor\ncoordination, and the clustering approach. Since the basic design\
    \ requirement of a WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT is to maintain the healthy functionality\
    \ and longevity of the SNs and the\nBS, any post-deployment impairments that cannot\
    \ be self-ﬁxed must be tolerated to not\ninterfere with the core function of the\
    \ network. Therefore, any automated FT mechanism\nthat can be achieved through\
    \ the self-reconﬁguration and self-management for enhanced\nnetwork availability,\
    \ reliability, and dependability is encouraged in the WSN sublayer [92].\nAccording\
    \ to Figure 17, an efﬁcient WSN-based Agri-IoT, therefore, requires a calculated\n\
    mix of FT mechanisms based on the intended application.\n6.2. Systematic Survey\
    \ of Fault Management Schemes in WSN-Based IoT\nFM in Agri-IoT networks has not\
    \ received adequate conceptualized research con-\nsiderations. As a result, existing\
    \ Agri-IoT solutions inherit the FM propositions from\nthe traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT networks, which have proven to be unsuitable [14]. This\nsubsection presents\
    \ a concise overview of these FM schemes, including their strengths,\nweaknesses,\
    \ and underlying theories/concepts. It then proposes a more suitable remedy for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT technology. In canon centralized FM schemes (see references\
    \ in [93–97]),\nthe underlying FM algorithm is hosted and managed on the BS, while\
    \ the local SNs host\nand manage the FM algorithm in distributed architectures\
    \ [87,88]. Although the centralized\napproach is simpler for small-scale networks,\
    \ it suffers many technical challenges, such\nas common point failure due to heavy\
    \ message trafﬁc at the BS, management difﬁculties,\nand high energy wastages\
    \ on distant routing. This clearly explains why most outdoor\nAgri-IoT testbed\
    \ experiments in [1,10,11,14,18,19] experienced severe FM complications to\nthe\
    \ extent that the networks became infeasible to operate or manage at higher scalability\n\
    levels. However, the distributed approach (see references in [74,76,77,91,98–103])\
    \ saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc and workload on the BS because it allows\
    \ local decisions\nas well as local-FD/FT with or without neighboring nodes. The\
    \ distributed FD/FT scheme\ncan also be self-executed, neighbor-coordinated, or\
    \ clustering-aided [89–91]. Although the\nclustering-based FM architecture has\
    \ promising potential to improve energy conservation,\nnetwork adaptability, and\
    \ ease of implementation, it has not been extensively researched\nand exploited.\n\
    Again, distributed FD schemes are mainly established on the assumption that the\n\
    failure of SNs is spatially uncorrelated, while event information is spatially\
    \ correlated.\nTherefore, the FD’s decision framework is frequently modeled using\
    \ sensory data or statis-\ntical properties of the spatial or temporally correlated\
    \ SNs [79,104–106] from the immediate\nneighborhood of a node [74,103] or data\
    \ from farther SNs [107]. To date, the applicabil-\nity of these solutions to\
    \ the Agri-IoT context has attracted several technical challenges.\nConsequently,\
    \ the strengths and weaknesses of the main results of the benchmarking FM\nschemes,\
    \ their underlying assumptions, and how they addressed the critical fault-afﬁnity\n\

    \ and Their Shortcomings\nThe conceptual models/theories of the canon FD decision\
    \ frameworks and the associ-\nated shortcomings can be expressed as follows:\n\
    •\nStatistical approaches such as Neyman–Pearson formulation [116], Bayesian statis-\n\
    tics [77,103], and normal distribution test types (e.g., Thompson Tau statistical\
    \ test [105])\nare high-resource-demanding techniques that may apply to classic\
    \ IoT. Still, they are\nunsuitable for power-constrained Agri-IoT devices or SNs.\
    \ In addition to being stand-\nalone and without application speciﬁcity, these\
    \ methods operate at high computational\nand control message complexities. Their\
    \ operational efﬁciencies increase with increas-\ning data dimensionality and\
    \ also require a priori knowledge of data distribution,\nwhich is not possible\
    \ in many real-life applications of Agri-IoT networks. Additionally,\nthey rely\
    \ on predeﬁned thresholds to make local and global FD decisions. Therefore,\n\
    regardless of the extensive research considerations of these methods, they are\
    \ generally\nnot suitable for low-power IoT applications, of which Agri-IoT is\
    \ no exception.\n•\nGraph-based FM techniques lack precise criteria for outlier\
    \ detections [83,109], suffer\nhigher computational complexities, and also make\
    \ unrealistic assumptions about the\ndata distribution. In addition, these approaches\
    \ (e.g., De Bruijn graph theory [109]\nand depth-based techniques) are unsuitable\
    \ for multidimensional and huge datasets.\n•\nMachine learning decision concepts\
    \ such as the k-out-of-n and majority decision\nrule concepts [93], naive Bayes,\
    \ iterative algorithms [107], and neural network-based\ntechniques, among others,\
    \ are susceptible to high dimensional datasets, suffer high\ncomputational cost,\
    \ and rely on sensitive model parameters.\nIn addition to the stipulated shortcomings,\
    \ these benchmarking FM methods usually\nignore the sensory data correlation (i.e.,\
    \ attribute correlation, spatial correlation, and tem-\nporal correlation) properties\
    \ of SNs, require high communication overhead with high FD\ndelays [83], and normally\
    \ operate in an ofﬂine manner, which is inconsistent with the\nmodus operandi\
    \ of typical Agri-IoT. Hence, they are unsuitable for the recent low-power\nAgri-IoT\
    \ applications.\n6.4. Open Issues on Existing FM Solutions for Classic WSN-Based\
    \ IoT Networks and\nRecommended Design Guidelines for Achieving Efﬁcient FM in\
    \ WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nA fault in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks can be\
    \ manifested as a data outlier\nand SN-out-of-service or node failure, both of\
    \ which must be detected and resolved locally\nor globally using the spatially\
    \ correlated event information and efﬁcient threshold-based\ndecision frameworks.\
    \ Although there has been extensive research concerning FM schemes\nfor the WSN\
    \ sublayer, several technical challenges that require urgent contextual research\n\
    considerations exist. They include the following:\n1.\nMost faults in the PHY\
    \ layer of Agri-IoT originate from the SNs’ power exhaustion,\nwhich implies that\
    \ the best fault-avoidance techniques are those that optimize power\nconsumption.\
    \ However, most FM schemes waste more energy and make the net-\nwork prone to\
    \ more faults/failures via high control messages and computational\ncomplexities.\n\
    2.\nMost FM schemes exist as stand-alone frameworks without architectural consider-\n\
    ations and are founded on unrealistic assumptions, which make them difﬁcult to\n\
    incorporate into existing routing protocols.\n3.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture\
    \ is endowed with many untapped local/global FM\npotentials and fault-avoidance\
    \ capacities for the next-generation Agri-IoT. However, these\npromising potentials\
    \ have received the least contextualized research considerations.\nExisting FM\
    \ solutions are meant for resource-sufﬁcient and expensive classic WSN-\nbased\
    \ IoT, not resource-constrained, context-speciﬁc use cases like Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    Regarding these technical challenges, this tutorial presents the following design\
    \ guidelines\nfor building efﬁcient and realistic FM schemes for WSN-based Agri-IoT:\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n302\n1.\nFM schemes must rely on realistic and contextual assumptions\
    \ in order to detect and\nauto-tolerate sensory data outliers and SN-out-of-service\
    \ faults in real-time routing\nprotocols with minimal message, computational,\
    \ and memory complexities. Such FM\nschemes will be suitable for all power-constrained\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n2.\nFuture works on FM schemes must be embedded\
    \ into speciﬁc routing protocols so\nthat their adaptability to topological dynamism\
    \ and scalability in terms of network\nsizes and node densities can be assessed\
    \ in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, fault\ndetection and fault-tolerance schemes\
    \ based on simple threshold-based theories are\nthe best candidates for this context,\
    \ since the threshold boundaries of agronomical\nmetrics can be accurately computed\
    \ from the historical data of the location.\n3.\nFM schemes must incorporate redundancy\
    \ check mechanisms by exploiting spatial\nand temporal correlations among sensory\
    \ data.\n4.\nFM schemes should maintain a good balance between local and global\
    \ FDs as well as\na reasonable detection rate and false alarm rate.\n7. State\
    \ of the Art on Real-World, Canon WSN-Based Agri-IoT Testbed Solutions\nIt is\
    \ well documented that WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most reliable remedy for mitigat-\n\
    ing the negative impacts climate change has had on agricultural production, for\
    \ which many\narchitectural designs and testbed prototypes have been proposed\
    \ [12,36]. In addition, since\nthe autonomous, resource-constrained SNs in Agri-IoT\
    \ are expected to operate without\npost-deployment maintenance checks, the issues\
    \ of FM, power optimization, and self-\norganization during SN design and network\
    \ deployment cannot be ignored in existing\ntestbed solutions [12,117]. Essentially,\
    \ the results from most research projects on Agri-IoT\nrelied on simulation experiments\
    \ [1,10,14], which have retained the gap between the phi-\nlosophy of this technology\
    \ and the comprehension of its real-world behavior for a more ac-\ncurate performance\
    \ assessment. This section presents a systematic performance assessment\nof the\
    \ few real-world WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions currently based on the classic\n\
    WSN-based IoT principles. To understand how the benchmarking realization testbeds\
    \ of\nAgri-IoT in [1,10,11,14,18,19] fared in real-world operational conditions,\
    \ the results from\ntheir respective performances are systematically evaluated\
    \ and summarized in Table 8. It\nwas discovered that the current benchmarking\
    \ testbed solutions in [1,10,11,14,18,19] are\ncapital-intensive because they\
    \ are reliant on ﬁxed/location-restricted backbone infrastruc-\ntures (see the\
    \ middle of Figure 3), too complicated to deploy and manage by even expert\nusers,\
    \ based on unrealistic indoor conditions which do not commensurate real-world\
    \ envi-\nronmental conditions, and based on the high- power-demanding centralized\
    \ or ﬂooding\narchitectures which further complicate network manageability when\
    \ up-scaled. A concise\nand systematic survey of these benchmarking real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT networks and their ﬂaws\nin the state of the art is summarized in Table\
    \ 8.\nAdditionally, it can be established from the comparative assessment of the\
    \ benchmark-\ning Agri-IoT testbeds in Table 8 [10,11,18,19] that the embedded\
    \ communication technology,\nevent routing architecture, and the SNs’ power management\
    \ are the core factors that made\nthem capital-intensive and complicated to both\
    \ experts and low-income farmers. Addi-\ntionally, self-healing, reconﬁgurability,\
    \ and adaptability mechanisms to faults were not\ndeployed [1,14,17]; hence, faulty\
    \ and turbulent conditions could not be tolerated. Further-\nmore, since the battery-powered\
    \ SNs rely on expensive Wi-Fi and cellular communication\ntechnologies that are\
    \ not freely accessible at all locations, the SNs exhausted their battery\nsupply\
    \ a few days after deployment. Similarly, those that relied on ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.\
    \ 4\ncommunication technologies with power-intensive 6LoWPAN or IPv6 protocols\
    \ restricted\nthe resulting network to drive on the problematic centralized or\
    \ ﬂooding architectures\nwithout any efﬁcient FM techniques. As a result, these\
    \ solutions used costly ﬁxed IP\ninfrastructural supports and the centralized\
    \ routing architecture, making them practically\nimpossible to manage as the networks\
    \ scaled. This is why the SNs unstably exhausted their\nbattery power and abruptly\
    \ abridged network lifespans [1,10,11,14,18,19].\nIoT 2023, 4\n303\nTable 8. Comparative\

    Therefore, the freely available low-power wireless technologies (e.g., LoRa, BLE,\
    \ 5G,\nZ-wave, NB-IoT, and SigFox) that are founded on a suitable routing topology\
    \ are the best\ncandidates for making this ubiquitous application [1,16] cheap\
    \ [1,20] and simple for all\nusers. Thus, the cluster-based topology is more pivotal\
    \ to addressing the above challenges\nof Agri-IoT [10,17] than the traditional\
    \ cellular and WiFi technologies that are inaccessible\nin many farms, depending\
    \ on their locations [10,20]. However, besides distance-power\nconstraints, architectural\
    \ support, and network manageability challenges, these freely\naccessible wireless\
    \ communication technologies have speciﬁc limitations, which include:\n1.\nZigBee\
    \ technology achieves the desired power savings only when deployed in star or\n\
    centralized topology [14], and it operates at its low-power distance range (10–100\
    \ m)\nin line-of-sight mode depending on the environmental characteristics.\n\
    2.\nLoRa is limited to low-density and ﬁxed network sizes (non-scalable), a low\
    \ data rate,\nand a low message capacity [14]. It may require registration and\
    \ expensive antennae,\ndepending on its operation location.\n3.\nSigFox supports\
    \ a very low data rate and requires registration. LoRa and SigFox\npossess complex\
    \ implementations because they both require speciﬁc modules to\nfunction and gateways.\n\
    4.\nWiFi, GPRS, cellular technologies, and NB-IoT are high power consumption standards\n\
    and location-/architecture-restricted.\n5.\nBLE has a short communication range\
    \ but supports clustering architecture, which is the\nmost optimal architecture\
    \ for ensuring the best operational efﬁciency of WSN-based\nAgri-IoT deployments,\
    \ since this architecture allows cluster isolation and management.\nTherefore,\
    \ a research opportunity exists for a ﬂexible, ubiquitous, realistic, energy-\n\
    efﬁcient, self-healing, simple, low-cost, cluster-based, and wireless outdoor-based\
    \ testbed\nthat consists of infrastructure-less, task-scalable, and wirelessly\
    \ conﬁgurable experimental\nSNs and a BS. It should also be deployed, re-deployed,\
    \ monitored, controlled, and managed\nby non-experts to operate stably throughout\
    \ the entire crop-growing season.\n8. Case Study: Cluster-Based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\
    \ for Precision Irrigation\nAs earlier established in Figure 2, the design and\
    \ implementation of Agri-IoT networks\nare driven by unique critical factors,\
    \ which are mainly determined by the associated\nrouting architecture, communication\
    \ technology, actuation management mechanisms,\nand environmental impacts. In\
    \ the operation phase, these factors constitute the speciﬁc\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10, which the supervisory routing protocol must address in order\nto optimize\
    \ performance efﬁciency and stability. As systematically established above,\n\
    the LEACH-inherited cluster-based architecture has the most promising potential\
    \ to address\nIoT 2023, 4\n304\nthese technical challenges. It helps to attain\
    \ high power optimization via communication\ndistance and packet minimization,\
    \ efficient network administration/adaptability, high event\ndata quality through\
    \ auto-FM, and local data quality management, as indicated in Figure 10.\nSo,\
    \ this section presents a systematic analysis of how the merits of this architecture\
    \ evolve\nin CA-IoT for precision irrigation use cases. Using the framework in\
    \ Figure 12, the cluster-\nbased architecture was pre-examined to uncover how\
    \ the fundamental Agri-IoT design\nrequirements and goals presented in the reference\
    \ frameworks in Figures 2, 9 and 10 can\nunfold into realistic multi-parametric\
    \ optimization metrics.\nThe conceptual architectural framework of the proposed\
    \ network, as illustrated in\nFigure 18, can be implemented using Arduino-based\
    \ or Raspberry Pi(RPi)-based micro-\ncontrollers, BLE and LoRa for intra-cluster,\
    \ inter-cluster, and BS–cloud communications,\nrespectively, and DHT22/STEMMA\
    \ soil moisture sensors for measuring the respective\nambient and soil microclimatic\
    \ parameters. Also, a unit cluster from Figure 18 detailing\nthe key network components\
    \ of MNs, CH, BS, and the ﬁeld-deployed precision irrigation\nsystem is shown\
    \ in Figure 19. It is assumed that the core units constituting the MNs, CH,\n\
    and BS, as illustrated in Figure 19, are optimally selected and designed after\
    \ Figure 2. Using\nFigures 18 and 19 as the reference architectural frameworks\
    \ for achieving our contextualized\nobjectives, this section presents an in-depth\

    \ 20a, the cluster features deﬁne the underlying connectivity\nissues, such as\
    \ cluster quality indices (thus, cluster count, cluster size) and intra-cluster\n\
    and inter-cluster communication types (thus, single-hop or multihop or both) [23,24].\n\
    From the network design viewpoint, the cluster quality depends on the optimality\
    \ of the\nCH count and cluster sizes, which in turn rely on the core design parameters,\
    \ such as the\nspatial density and uniformity of the deployed nodes, the speciﬁcation\
    \ of the wireless\ncommunication standard, the routing architecture, and the size\
    \ of the network [47]. Since\nthe deployment of SNs in a typical Agri-IoT can\
    \ be controlled, the stipulated cluster quality\nproperties can be optimized to\
    \ resolve connectivity issues in Figure 20b. In a randomly\ndeployed ﬁeld, these\
    \ cluster quality parameters can be optimized using a pairing-based SN\nduty-scheduling\
    \ mechanisms [9,12].\nSecondly, the CH features can be static, mobile, or role-rotated\
    \ in both homogeneous\nor heterogeneous networks [9,12] based on the SNs’ resource\
    \ hierarchy. Additionally,\nthe CHs can be assigned different tasks, such as data\
    \ aggregation, FM, coordinating\nnetwork reconﬁguration or duty cycling, and network\
    \ maintenance, depending on their\nresource capacities and network requirements.\
    \ This case study is based on static SNs and\nthe distributed network construction\
    \ approach (see references in [9,12,33,126–132]), where\nthe SNs locally manage\
    \ the entire clustering process, and a CH is elected without the entire\nnetwork’s\
    \ information.\nAs shown in Figure 20a, the clustering process can be characterized\
    \ by the clustering\nmethod/network type (thus, centralized or distributed), the\
    \ CH selection method, recluster-\ning or network adaptability to topological\
    \ or scalable conditions, and the complexities (thus,\ncontrol message and computational\
    \ complexities) of the entire network operation cycle.\nUnlike the static approach\
    \ with ﬁxed CH, the adaptive clustering approach selects CH\nbased on the current\
    \ network conditions and rotates this role. However, both approaches\ncan incorporate\
    \ self-reclustering techniques to self-heal SN-out-of-service faults. Data\noutlier\
    \ faults can be best detected and corrected using threshold-based decision theory\
    \ or\nspatial correlation methods with the least complexities. Due to the large-scale\
    \ and high\ndeployment densities of WSN-based Agri-IoT, the distributed clustering\
    \ process is more\nsuitable for enhancing local FM, scalability, network management,\
    \ and power optimization\nthan the centralized approaches [37,47].\nGenerally,\
    \ the CA-IoT network can be optimized by formulating the deduced optimal\ndecision\
    \ metrics in Figure 20a into a MOO framework and multihop routing model in\norder\
    \ to provide the guidelines for the design of the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. From\
    \ the\ncomparative evaluations of Figures 10 and 20a, a taxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ for designing\nan efﬁcient WSN-based CA-IoT network is proposed in Figure 20b.\
    \ To enhance the clarity\nof the state of the art on cluster-based protocols and\
    \ justify the need for the proposed MOO\nmetrics, a comparative summary based\
    \ on the characterization parameters is presented in\nTable 9.\n8.2. CH Election\
    \ Techniques\nA CH selection process is very critical to the resulting network’s\
    \ performance efﬁciency.\nIn addition to centralized networks and the computationally\
    \ expensive fuzzy-based clus-\ntering approaches [133,134], the efﬁciencies of\
    \ all LEACH-inherited protocols are mainly\ndependent on their CH selection techniques\
    \ [47,49]. Therefore, the correct estimation of\nthe cluster quality metrics (i.e.,\
    \ CHs count and cluster size) is pivotal in attaining the\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10. With the aid of nodes’ residual energy and location metrics, the op-\ntimal\
    \ CH count and cluster size can be preset before network deployment. Currently,\n\
    these metrics are randomly selected using a probabilistic approach in LEACH-inherited\n\
    protocol [9,21] or derived using a deterministic or an attribute-based method\
    \ [47,135].\nHowever, the probabilistic clustering, such as the LEACH-inherited\
    \ protocols, is expected\nto perform better in terms of network lifespan, minimal\
    \ clustering overhead, improved\nconnectivity, network/coverage stability, low\
    \ latency, collision-free routing, load balanc-\ning, high network stability span,\
    \ and algorithmic simplicity if the optimal CH count was\nIoT 2023, 4\n308\npredeﬁned\
    \ correctly [136]. However, the CH count is randomly predeﬁned in these proto-\n\
    cols [9,21], which undermines the CH’s stability and the resulting architecture’s\
    \ optimality.\nThis challenge can be addressed via common CH selection metrics\
    \ including Euclidean\ndistance, intra-cluster/inter-cluster communication costs,\
    \ energy-harvesting capacities,\nand probabilistic factors. To date, the related\
    \ attempts in [49,126,137–139] only relied on\nthe SNs’ residual energy and location\
    \ information to re-elect CHs after the initial CH count\nis deﬁned, which cannot\
    \ be ideal for WSN-based Agri-IoT.\nFor instance, an active SN in a particular\
    \ round decides whether or not to become\na CH by choosing a random number (rn)\
    \ ranging between 0 and 1 and comparing the\nnumber with a speciﬁed threshold\
    \ Th. A node, therefore, becomes a CH for that round if\nrn < Th, where Th is\
    \ expressed as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd×(( f irst−round)mod 1\npd\n,\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(1)\nwhere pd is the desired percentage of CHs or CH count per round,\
    \ and G is the number of\nSNs that have not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds.\n\
    The authors in [119] proposed a three-layered LEACH (TL-LEACH) that operates in\n\
    three functional phases—CH election, MN recruitment, and data transfer—to enhance\
    \ the\nenergy efﬁciency of LEACH. Their ﬁrst-level CH election approach modiﬁed\
    \ Equation (1)\ninto an enhanced threshold T(i), which is expressed as:\nT(i)\
    \ =\n(\n(r + 1) × mod( 1\np × p),\nif i ∈ G\n0,\notherwise\n(2)\nwhere p is the\
    \ CH count, r is the current round number, and G is the number of SNs that\nhave\
    \ not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds. The second-level CHs are selected\
    \ from\nthe ﬁrst-level CHs based on the shortest distance to the BS to function\
    \ as aggregated packet\nforwarders or relay CHs (RCHs).\nThe authors in [120]\
    \ introduced energy (E(i)) and distance (D(i)) attributes into Equa-\ntion (1)\
    \ to improve the load-balancing merit of LEACH. The resulting Th is expressed\
    \ as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd[r×mod 1\npd ] × [E(i) + (1 − D(i))],\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(3)\nMultihop routing via relay CHs (RCHs) was recommended for distant\
    \ CHs in the\nfuture scope of [120].\nIn the LEACH presented with a distance-based\
    \ threshold (LEACH-DT) algorithm\nin [121], the probability of becoming a CH depends\
    \ on the relative distance between a\nnode and the BS. This algorithm differs\
    \ from the LEACH algorithm because the desired\npercentage of CHs (pi) is predeﬁned\
    \ using Equation (5), while the threshold T(I, r) is\nexpressed as:\nT(i, r) =\n\
    (\npi\n1−pi×[r×mod 1\npi ],\nif Gi(r) = 0\n0,\nif Gi(r) = 1\n(4)\nNote that the\
    \ terms retain their usual deﬁnitions, namely:\np(i) = k\nξi\n∑N\nj=1 ξj\n, 0\
    \ ≤ pi ≤ 1,\n(5)\nwhere\nξi = 1/ECH × di − Enon−CH,\n(6)\nThe variable di depicts\
    \ the distance between node i and the BS, and ECH and Enon−CH\nare the average\
    \ residual energies in CHs and non-CHs, respectively. The authors further\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n309\nestablished the need for a multihop routing approach in simulations\
    \ and real-world WSNs\nto validate the countless theoretical propositions and\
    \ beneﬁts.\nIn the decentralized energy-efﬁcient hierarchical cluster-based routing\
    \ algorithm\n(DHCR) [123], SNs compete to become CHs. First, the BS broadcasts\
    \ a trigger message at a\nspeciﬁc range. The receiving nodes then compete to become\
    \ a CH by disseminating a new\nmessage containing their residual energies and\
    \ distances from the BS. Using this informa-\ntion, a neighboring node i within\
    \ the target range receives the message and calculates its\nCHSn f uni as:\nCHSn\
    \ f uni = a × Erei\nEmax\n+ b ×\n1\nDis − To − BSi\n,\n(7)\nwhere Erei and Emax\
    \ are the residual and initial energy levels of node i, respectively;\nDis − To\
    \ − BSi is the distance between node i and the BS, and a and b are real random\n\
    values between 0 and 1 such that a + b = 1. The values of Dis − To − BSi of node\
    \ i\nand its neighbors are compared, and the node with the highest Dis − To −\
    \ BSi value is\nselected as the CH. A ﬁrst-level CH broadcasts its residual energy,\
    \ neighboring node count,\nand distance from the BS via a speciﬁc route. The next-level\
    \ CHs receive the information\nand similarly repeat the procedure to ensure that\
    \ every node determines a redistributor\nCH to the BS at the same time. A redistributor\
    \ CH has more energy and fewer neighbors\n(neighboring degrees).\nHowever, the\
    \ Hamilton energy-efﬁcient routing protocol (HEER) [124] creates an\nentire cluster\
    \ of nodes, aggregates data, and transmits them to the BS via a Hamiltonian\n\
    path that has been created by the entire cluster of nodes and controls the cluster\
    \ size by\nselecting one node as the CH using the probability function p, which\
    \ can be expressed as:\np = Lmessage\nFmax\n(8)\nwhere Lmessage is the size of\
    \ every node, and Fmax is the maximum size of a frame. The\nHEER protocol creates\
    \ the clusters only once in the ﬁrst round based on LEACH, and it\nrole-rotates\
    \ the CHs per the energy on the Hamiltonian path after a determined period.\n\
    Similarly, the two-phased EAMR protocol [125] randomly preselects the CH. A CH\n\
    also selects its closest CH as its redistributor CH. The clusters are static over\
    \ the entire\nnetwork lifetime, and the CH role rotates randomly within the clusters\
    \ according to a cluster\nreplacement threshold. The new CH inherits the redistributor\
    \ role if the old CH had one.\nOverall, since the node location, residual energy,\
    \ and sleep schedule are indispensable in the\nCH selection process, the CH selection\
    \ methods proposed by the authors in [9,12,36,120,140]\nare recommended WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n8.3. Challenges of Existing MOO Frameworks and Recommended\
    \ Future Works\nAs Figures 9 and 10 illustrate, the performance efﬁciency of an\
    \ infrastructure-less\nWSN-based Agri-IoT mainly depends on the embedded MOO remedies\
    \ in the associated\nsupervisory routing protocol [12]. Several MOO frameworks\
    \ have been researched since\nAgri-IoT networks are subjected to multiple design\
    \ and operational constraints. A MOO\nframework is expected to formulate multiple\
    \ objective functions from a set of MOO metrics\nto simultaneously optimize these\
    \ multiple objectives, such as the maximal energy savings,\nhighest connectivity,\
    \ best latency, highest reliability, and balanced SN power depletion\nrates across\
    \ the network. Although the MOO methods are the best candidates for Agri-IoT,\n\
    the existing MOO solutions used in Agri-IoT are adopted from traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT\nwithout any contextual evaluation [12,16,26]. Consequently, they have not\
    \ fulﬁlled their\nintended purposes due to several technical challenges, including\
    \ the following:\n1.\nThey are limited to non-cluster-based network architectures,\
    \ which implies that the promis-\ning potentials of the clustering architecture\
    \ are not adequately exploited [9,12,50,51].\n2.\nThey are frequently implemented\
    \ in the operational phase of the network, which\nmakes it challenging to ﬁnd\
    \ global optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nIoT 2023, 4\n310\n\
    conﬂicting objective functions. The performance optimality of the Agri-IoT network\n\
    starts from the SN design.\n3.\nThey rely on high-resource-demanding algorithms,\
    \ such as mathematical programming-\nbased scalarization methods, multi-objective\
    \ genetic algorithms (MOGAs), heuristics/\nmetaheuristics-based optimization algorithms,\
    \ and other advanced optimization\ntechniques [23,26,48], making them unsuitable\
    \ for the battery-powered SNs in Agri-IoT.\n4.\nThere are no contextual MOO guidelines\
    \ based on Figure 20 to govern the PHY-layer\ndesign of Agri-IoT to achieve global\
    \ optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nconﬂicting objectives. Consequently,\
    \ there are conﬂicting scenarios in existing MOO\nsolutions [50].\nTherefore,\
    \ there is an urgent demand for a realistic low-power MOO framework for\nCA-IoT\
    \ networks that is founded on the core WSN design metrics and MOO taxonomy\nmetrics\
    \ in Figure 10 and the top of Figure 20, respectively. The following section assesses\n\
    how evaluations and deductions evolve in a typical event sampling and routing\
    \ protocol\nin a CA-IoT network for precision irrigation system management.\n\
    9. Design of WSN-Speciﬁc CA-IoT Routing Protocol\nThis section proposes a CA-IoT-based\
    \ supervisory routing protocol that supports\nstatic SNs, rotatable/ﬁxed CH roles,\
    \ and enhanced SN resource management under the\ndeterministic deployment approach.\
    \ This can improve energy savings, connectivity, dis-\ntance moderation, and multihop\
    \ inter-cluster communication in the resulting network.\nThe operational cycle\
    \ and the embedded activities of our WSN-based CA-IoT protocol for\nprecision\
    \ irrigation application, as illustrated in Figure 21, include the following:\n\
    1.\nNetwork Construction or Setup Phase: This phase involves network modeling,\
    \ CH election,\nand cluster formation, which is explained in Figure 21. The active–sleep\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduling ensures the SNs only switch to active mode during their\
    \ scheduled sampling\ndurations. In randomly deployed WSNs, redundant event reporting\
    \ can be avoided\nusing a correlated pairing-based active–sleep duty-cycle scheduling\
    \ approach in [12].\nThe optimal CH count and cluster size must be predeﬁned from\
    \ the resource capacities\nof the SNs. After the initial CH election, the MNs\
    \ are recruited and assigned their\nrespective sampling and intra-cluster communication\
    \ timeslots.\n2.\nSampling, Data Management, and Transmission Phase: The tasks\
    \ executed in this phase\ninclude event sampling, intra-cluster and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmissions, data outlier\nFM, and event data redundancy management.\
    \ Since microclimatic soil parameters do\nnot change swiftly [1,14], sampling\
    \ can only be scheduled during the day at 3-hourly\ntime intervals. In addition\
    \ to power optimization, the clustering approach provides\nsuperb potential for\
    \ both local and global FM using threshold-based FM theory and\nspatial correlation\
    \ techniques. Based on the architecture in Figure 19 and the resource\nlimitations\
    \ of the SNs, it is recommended that the communication beyond the BS or\ngateway\
    \ can utilize LoRa or Wi-Fi AirBox, whereas the intra-cluster and inter-cluster\n\
    communications must be the freely available low-power BLE technology, since it\
    \ is\nthe most suitable for the clustering architecture.\n3.\nNetwork Maintenance\
    \ and Reclustering Phase: This phase resolves all unforeseen topolog-\nical dynamics\
    \ caused by the SNs’ failures, network scalability, node mobility, and un-\nexpected\
    \ operational ﬂaws, without interfering with the normal network functionality\n\
    via adaptive reclustering, self-healing, and multihop routing techniques [12,23,24].\n\
    Here, a parent CH coordinates the election of child CHs (CCHs). While all non-CCHs\n\
    switch to sleep mode, the CCHs recruit new MNs using location and residual energy\n\
    parameters, assign them their respective sampling timeslots, and repeat Phase\
    \ 2 after-\nward, as shown in Figure 21. SN-out-of-service faults are auto-detected\

    \ suitable MAC method, a low-power wireless communication standard, data\naggregation\
    \ with data redundancy checks, and CH role rotation, among other factors.\nAlthough\
    \ the various sections of the deduced MOO metrics have been implemented in our\n\
    CA-IoT operational cycle, the most desired performance can be optimally attained\
    \ when\nthe MOO metrics are modeled into their respective objective functions,\
    \ and their optimal\nvalues are determined and implemented in both simulation\
    \ and testbed experiments in\nfuture works. Also, a realistic multihop routing\
    \ framework can also be inculcated into this\nprotocol for large-scale applications.\n\
    10. Open Issues and Future Works: Cluster-Based WSN-Speciﬁc Agri-IoT Networks\n\
    This tutorial has ﬁrmly established that the WSN-based Agri-IoT is an indispens-\n\
    able component of smart or precision farming and greenhouses, despite its resource-\
    \ and\ndeployment-induced challenges [12,26,141]. Unlike the conventional IoT,\
    \ Agri-IoT is com-\npelled to drive on batteries and affordable task-scalable\
    \ SNs. However, it must meet the\nexpectations in Figure 2 to guarantee a stable\
    \ performance. The cluster-based routing\ntechnique has emerged with promising\
    \ potential to mitigate these challenges. However,\nresults from existing testbed\
    \ solutions in this study show otherwise due to the absence of a\ncontextualized\
    \ in-depth overview of Agri-IoT as well as the following open issues which\nhave\
    \ not received extensive contextual research considerations in Agri-IoT applications:\n\
    1.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture for WSN-based Agri-IoT has not received\
    \ holistic\nand practical research considerations as far as FM, power optimization,\
    \ and network\nadaptability are concerned. Therefore, there is a demand for multi-parametric\
    \ optimiza-\ntion frameworks and guidelines for designing and implementing the\
    \ WSN sublayer.\n2.\nConcerning FM, most proposed schemes in the canon state of\
    \ the art are stand-\nalone, have high control message and computational complexities\
    \ (energy-inefﬁcient),\nand are mostly incompatible with the clustering architecture\
    \ [25,52]. The desired\nFM schemes for CA-IoT applications should be equipped\
    \ with fault-avoidance mech-\nIoT 2023, 4\n312\nanisms and the capacity to detect\
    \ and self-heal root faults (SN-out-of-service and\nsensory data outliers [25]),\
    \ not their effects.\n3.\nMultihop routing, which is a requirement to attain the\
    \ desired energy savings and\nnetwork adaptability in large-scale CA-IoT networks,\
    \ is asserted to be more energy-\nefﬁcient only in simulation experiments [33,120,121,123–125,128–130]\
    \ but not in real-\nworld implementation [22–24]. This imbalance is due to a lack\
    \ of a comprehensive\nand reliable theoretical multihop routing framework that\
    \ is based on the total commu-\nnication costs of multihop routing.\n4.\nThere\
    \ is a demand for a more realistic and holistic MOO framework that can op-\ntimize\
    \ the operational efﬁciency metrics such as cluster size, cluster counts, den-\n\
    sity/uniformity of nodes, communication distance, and activity schedule/duration,\n\
    right from the network design phase to the operational phase of Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    5.\nAlthough the current literature supports adaptive clustering with CH role\
    \ rotation\nideology, there exists the need for an optimal initial CH-count estimator\
    \ in order to\nimprove the stability of CH elections and the architecture. Thus,\
    \ the cluster quality\nindices (e.g., optimal cluster count and size) must be\
    \ predetermined before deﬁning\nthem in the associated CH election method, since\
    \ CH stability is compromised in most\nclustering methods [9,21,119–121,123,124].\n\
    6.\nMost protocols in the state of the art rely on perfect homogeneous networks,\
    \ which is\nunrealistic due to variations in modular specifications and resource\
    \ utilization and the\nfact that different SNs may have different communication\
    \ and data computational roles.\nTherefore, a more realistic, contextualized,\
    \ and adaptive clustering approach that leverages\nthe gap between the philosophy\
    \ and practice of Agri-IoT applications is needed.\n7.\nIn addition to the parent\
    \ LEACH protocol [21,61] which is a complete suite application\ncomprising routing,\
    \ MAC, and physical characteristics for wireless communication in\nWSNs, most\
    \ benchmarking MAC protocols purposed for traditional IoT applications\nare shelved,\
    \ since they are developed in solitude without application speciﬁcity and\nnetwork\
    \ architectural considerations. A custom-built and holistic protocol suite for\n\
    Agri-IoT remains a research opportunity.\n11. Conclusion and Future Works\nThis\
    \ tutorial presented: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts, tech-\n\
    nologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT; (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the tech-\nnical design requirements of a robust, ubiquitous, self-healing,\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, adaptive,\nand affordable Agri-IoT; (3) a comprehensive survey\
    \ of the benchmarking FM techniques,\ncommunication standards, routing protocols,\
    \ MMAC protocols, and WSN-based testbed\nsolutions; and (4) an in-depth case study\
    \ on how to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, adaptive, stable,\
    \ and cluster-based WSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\ntaxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ that can guarantee optimized network performance. Further-\nmore, this tutorial\
    \ established new taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO\nmetrics\
    \ for CA-IoT networks. Using the open technical issues, it recommended application-\n\
    speciﬁc requirements of Agri-IoT, general design expectations, and remedial measures,\n\
    and it evaluated them in CA-IoT for precision irrigation in order to optimally\
    \ exploit the\nproposed MOO metrics in a typical CA-IoT design in both simulation\
    \ and real-world\ndeployment scenarios. Overall, this tutorial can serve as a\
    \ new reference document for the\nIoT community and Agri-IoT designers, since\
    \ it adequately examined all critical aspects of\nWSN-based Agri-IoT networks\
    \ from theoretical modeling to real-world implementation.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    cities contain intelligent things which can intelligently automatically and collaboratively
    enhance life quality, save people''s lives, and act a sustainable resource ecosystem.
    To achieve these advanced collaborative technologies such as drones, robotics,
    artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) are required to increase
    the smartness of smart cities by improving the connectivity, energy efficiency,
    and quality of services (QoS). Therefore, collaborative drones and IoT play a
    vital role in supporting a lot of smart-city applications such as those involved
    in communication, transportation, agriculture,safety and security, disaster mitigation,
    environmental protection, service delivery, energy saving, e-waste reduction,

    we focus on the new concept of collaborative drones and IoT for improving smart-city
    applications. This survey attempts to show how collaborative drones and IoT improve
    the smartness of smart cities based on data collection, privacy and security,
    public safety, disaster management, energy consumption and quality of life in
    smart cities. It mainly focuses on the measurement of the smartness of smart cities,

    I. Introduction In the context of smart cities, the smartness measurement is related
    to quality of life, healthcare, public safety, disaster management, environmental
    aspects (such as energy efficiency, air quality, traffic monitoring, etc.), and
    services. Consequently, advanced and modern Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and robotics play vital roles in making cities
    smarter. These technologies help improve the infrastructure of smart cities and
    make smart services possible in order to improve the overall quality of life of
    the residents. An important aspect of smart cities is the provision of efficient
    infrastructure and the reduction of the cost of services while making such services
    and facilities ubiquitous. Recently, several studies have been conducted to enhance
    the characteristics of smart cities [1], [2] in different domains [3] and different
    aspects [4], [5], and with a focus on sustainability [6], [7]. A common undercurrent
    that runs in all of these studies is the fact that efficient integration of smart
    services and ICT solutions is required. More recently, drone technology has significantly
    contributed to making a city smarter. Presently, it is difficult to envisage a
    smart city without drone services [8]. Drones are autonomous robots that fly in
    the sky and are associated with different applications in civilian society such
    as communication, transportation, agriculture, safety and security, disaster mitigation,
    environmental protection, intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance
    operations. Drones are poised to become an integral part of smart cities and improve
    overall life experience in the sense of monitoring pollution, accident investigation,
    fire-fighting, package delivery, supporting first responder activities, delivering
    medicine, monitoring traffic, and supervising construction sites. Drone technology
    can further lead to enormous secondary benefits such as reducing power consumption,
    conserving resources, reducing pollution, accessing hazardous and disaster areas,
    and increasing preparedness for emergencies. Advances in technologies in the area
    of sensors, data processing, and rechargeable batteries have made drones more
    affordable. Drones can also act as aerial base station (BS) to deliver communication
    services (both uplink and downlink) for the subscribers on the ground. Agility
    and line-of-sight (LoS) are the features that have made drones play an essential
    role in the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. The advent of IoT has enabled
    significant advances in smart cities applications such as smart homes, smart streets,
    smart parking, smart power grids, etc. The main idea of IoT is that everything
    can connect and communicate over the Internet, for example,smartphones, buildings,
    home appliances, vehicles, and even natural objects, creating a smart world and
    vast global infrastructure for an information-driven society. The development
    of such applications has become critical to our lifestyles, the economy, and the
    environment. Apart from economic growth, the overall development of a geographical
    entity is also driven by green technologies which protect the environment from
    harmful emissions and hazardous wastes, conserve natural resources, mitigate the
    consequences of climate change, and reduce pollution and power consumption. A
    massive number of IoT devices which can cooperate, communicate and share information,
    is the needed for modern smart city infrastructure. Considering that a large number
    of interconnected devices is required, the minimization of operating costs and
    power conservation strategies is becoming more and more critical [9]–[11]. Load
    balancing also plays a vital role in enhancing the lifetime of the network by
    reducing the over-consumption of energy by smart devices. Drones can move dynamically
    towards the IoT devices and collect data, establish a real-time connection, process
    the data and transmit information over to the collection nodes or other devices
    [12]. The efficient deployment and mobility of drones to collect data from IoT
    devices on the ground with minimum transmit power and enhanced communication reliability
    and connectivity were investigated in [13], [14]. It was reported that IoT transmitted
    power can be reduced by 45% while increasing the yield to a maximum of 28% [13].
    Also, in another related work, a drone was considered the middleware for energy
    efficient discovery in the IoT and sensor networks [15]. The proposed technique
    provided an efficient energy model to offer IoT and sensor network solutions.
    Furthermore, Motlagh et al. [16] proposed a steering technique among multiple
    4G networks to ensure reliable connectivity of smart devices with drones, which
    supports a high quality of service (QoS) and consumes an acceptable amount of
    energy. Mozaffari et al. [17] proposed a multi-clustering technique of IoT devices
    wherein each cluster was served by one or more drone. Due to the use of drones,
    the transmitted power of the IoT devices reduced by 56% compared to the fixed
    Voronoi deployment method. In this particular case, drones were used to enhance
    the energy efficiency because the transmission range of IoT devices was limited
    [18]. Furthermore, the collaborative wireless network between drones and IoT devices
    plays a vital role in providing an efficient solution to the routing loop problem
    in traditional sensor networks, and enhancing the lifetime of the sensors through
    optimal division of the load. However, these solutions rely on the formation of
    an optimal topology and routing scheme for utilization of the coordination between
    the drones and the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Briefly, as shown in Fig. 1,
    a collaboration between drones and IoT can provide broad applications in smart
    cities such as the monitoring of large areas, border surveillance, data gathering,
    public safety, disaster management, and obstacle avoidance [19]. Figure. 1 shows
    the collaboration of drones and IoT for several applications of smart cities such
    as gathering data from IoT devices for energy efficiency, collecting pollution
    data and predicting the air quality, monitoring sport events, generating high
    resolution 3D maps, providing security, disaster management for saving people’s
    lives, delivering services such as food and blood in real time, and monitoring
    accidents and victims. FIGURE 1. Collaborative drone and IoT for improving the
    smartness of smart cities. Show All A. Related Work Many studies have surveyed
    technologies and strategies related to enhancing the smartness level of smart
    cities by using drones in different applications [17], [20]–[29]. The smartness
    of smart cities has been evaluated on several factors such as smart living, smart
    environment, smart people, smart economy, smart mobility, smart tourism, smart
    governance and so on. Mohamed et al. [24] reviewed the potential applications
    of, and technical issues arising from, integrated drones in smart cities. Furthermore,
    they discussed the enabling technologies which have been developed to support
    the integration of drone in smart cities. The authors of [21] summarized the enabling
    technologies that could be used for green IoT for making smart cities smarter
    and greener. The authors of [23] described drone-enabled intelligent transportation
    for a smart city. They also highlighted the potential applications and challenges
    for drone-enabled intelligent transportation for next generation smart cities.
    Alam et al. [20] presented an architecture of an intelligent transportation system
    with distributed and decentralized decision making to make streets smarter by
    smart parking. Under this system, traffic management would be managed efficiently
    in smart cities by locating the vacant parking slots and communicating this information
    to drivers in a given area. Furthermore, the authors of [29] discussed various
    frameworks for smart cities monitoring based on smart drones. Authors of [22]
    surveyed the potential physical- and cyber-threats which might arise from the
    use of drones in different ways to track, detect, and interdict malicious drones.
    The authors of [28] reviewed various aspects of drone usage such as privacy, cyber-security,
    and public safety in future smart cities. Motlagh et al. [26] highlighted and
    reviewed drone architecture for delivering IoT services from a drone. Furthermore,
    they discussed the use of drones equipped with IoT devices such as Radio Frequency
    IDentification (RFID), sensors, and cameras that are used for data collection.
    The authors of [25] introduced the concept of drones-equipped with IoT devices
    for delivering services to a large coverage area from a drone in the sky. They
    mainly discussed how a drone could be used for crowd surveillance based on face
    recognition. Furthermore, they compared video data processing on the drone payload
    and mobile edge computing node. The findings demonstrated the efficiency of the
    mobile edge computing based offloading technique in the context of processing
    time, and energy consumption. The authors of [17] described how swarm drones could
    be used for collecting data from IoT devices on the ground to minimize the transmission
    power from IoT devices. Each drone was shown to deliver services to a cluster
    of IoT devices on the ground by taking the mobility of IoT devices in smart cities
    into consideration. The authors of [18] extended the collaboration between drone-enabled
    connectivity and IoT. A drone was considered to serve the ground users such as
    download users and device-to-device users. The findings showed that the usage
    of device-to-device users fell with an increase in the drone height because of
    the fact that a greater distance from the drone increased the path loss. Processing
    the collected data onboard a drone is required for several operations such as
    image processing, path monitoring and control, and dynamic sense. The authors
    of [30] designed powerful and useful devices for processing data with low power
    consumption. The authors of [31] applied machine learning schemes to images captured
    by drone-based IoT devices such as cameras. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to identify the exact videos and
    images taken by IoT devices on the drone. Briefly, the surveys conducted in [26]
    and [25] were primarily limited to architectures for delivering IoT services from
    drones. Similarly, the surveys conducted in [20], [23] were restricted to intelligent
    transportation in smart cities by using a drone. The studies in [27] and [22]
    focused on the applications and benefits of drones for wireless telecommunication.
    Furthermore, the studies detailed in [24] and [21] looked at the enabling technologies
    that integrate drones and smart cities to make them smarter and greener. Besides,
    the authors of [28] only discussed the drone applications for privacy and public
    safety, while the monitoring issues in a smart city were discussed in [29]. In
    short, the existing literature on collaborative drones and IoT for smart cities
    applications is fragmented and calls for a comprehensive overview of how the collaboration
    between drones and IoT can indeed be used. Surprisingly, no review has been thoroughly
    carried out considering the importance of drone collaboration and IoT, to improve
    the smartness of smart cities, and its applications. In light of the above discussion,
    a comparison of related work is shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Surveys
    Highlighted and Current Work B. Contribution The main contribution of this paper
    is the provision of a comprehensive overview of collaborative drones and IoT applications
    for smart cities. Toward this aim, the approach is to gather the available research
    contributions from the sparse literature on drone-based IoT, that addresses the
    applications, challenges, and opportunities of drone collaborations with IoT frameworks
    for improving life quality in smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this
    survey constitutes one of the first comprehensive surveys on how to fully exploit
    the potential of collaborative drones and IoT applications for improving the smartness
    of smart cities. Also, we highlight the drone’s potential for delivering IoT services
    from the sky. In order to achieve the aim of this paper, we address the following
    key topics, as shown in Fig. 2: In section II, we present a comprehensive overview
    of the collaboration of drones and IoT. In section III, we provide a discussion
    on security and privacy issues, as well as promising solutions associated with
    the collaboration of drones and IoT for enhancing the smartness of smart cities.
    In section IV, we discuss how collaborations between drones and IoT devices could
    be used to reduce energy consumption and increase the smartness and greening of
    smart cities. In section V, we outline the crucial role of collaboration between
    drones and IoT in gathering data. The collection of smart data and on-board processing
    in real-time plays a vital role in enhancing smart city applications. In section
    VI, we highlight how IoT and drone collaborations could be leveraged for improving
    life quality by controlling the pollution hazards of smart cities. In section
    VII, we discuss issues related to public safety in smart cities, and determine
    how a collaborative arrangement between drones and IoT may help. In Section VIII,
    we introduce the collaboration of drones and IoT for disaster management in smart
    cities. In section IX, we provide a summary of the applications of drone and IoT
    collaboration for smart cities. Lastly, discussion and future directions are highlighted
    in Section X. FIGURE 2. Survey contributions. Show All SECTION II. Overview of
    the Collaboration Between Drones and the IoT Collaboration between advanced technologies
    is about sharing information for performing common tasks effectively and efficiently
    according to needs. The benefits and applications of drones in wireless telecommunication
    were presented in [27]. Therefore, the collaboration of IoT devices for sensing
    data leads to an increase in the accuracy of data collection by exploiting the
    similarity of capturing data from multiple IoT devices [40]. Collaboration within
    the fog cloud of IoT devices was discussed in [33]. The authors of [8] presented
    the applications, challenges, and opportunities for drones in smart cities. Several
    challenges were discussed, such as privacy, safety, and ethical use. Furthermore,
    the issues of cybersecurity, public safety, and privacy of drones for smart cities
    were discussed in [28]. A. Smart Drones A drone has unique characteristics. It
    is dynamic, easy to repair, easy to deploy, and able to measure a multitude of
    quantities from anywhere at any time. It is a low-cost solution for collecting
    and delivering information to intelligent mechanisms/software capable of performing
    the required data analysis (such as analyzing the image or video in real time).
    The usage of the drone will dramatically facilitate the development of farming,
    defense, insurance inspection, law enforcement, emergency aid, pollution monitoring,
    disaster recovery, parcel delivery, and many other industries. Therefore, drones
    play a significant role in our connection with society as well as improving the
    quality of life in smart cities. The number of drones in the air is expected to
    grow rapidly in the coming years. Drones have enormous potential to enable many
    applications related to military, civilian, governmental sector and commercial
    aspects, due to their capability to perform complex tasks effectively and efficiently
    in real time. Jensen [41] introduced the drone phenomenon and its potential application
    for smart cities. He explored the connectivity issues related to drones for smart
    cities and discussed how drones would enhance smart cities applications, such
    as tracking, surveillance, and object detection; general purpose distributed processing
    application; data collection; path planning; navigation; and collision prevention,
    as shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the authors [42] discussed the convergence of
    several machine learning techniques for path planning effectively and efficiently
    to enhance the connectivity, mobility, and QoS. FIGURE 3. Drone applications categories.
    Show All A group of drones represents a cluster which uses the Flying Ad-hoc NETwork
    (FANET) technology for communication among its members, and also for sharing data
    gathered (by the onboard IoT devices) with other IoT devices on the ground. Using
    their inherent properties of ability, mobility, and agility, drones can efficiently
    enhance the QoS of 5G cellular networks. Also, they have been deployed to improve
    wireless capacity and coverage at temporary events such as sports, disaster recovery,
    crime monitoring, etc. [43]. Drones have also been used to enable the communication
    when traditional wireless networks are destroyed to support disaster relief activities
    [44]. Similarly, Merwaday and Guvenc [45] explored the use of a drone BS as a
    temporary station during a disaster relief operation. In addition to the work
    of [44], [45], Bor-Yaliniz and Yanikomeroglu [46] envisioned a drone cellular
    network which is capable of bringing the delivery of wireless networks to anywhere
    based on demand and at any time. Authors of [47] considered drone as a sink node
    in a wireless communication network for collecting data from sensors. The optimization
    of the drone network service area was also investigated. A drone payload may contain
    an on-board computer, and sensors connected to other devices, which allow humans
    to control it. Furthermore, it can be programmed to carry out tasks, and fly itself
    according to the guidance of its internal systems. Also, it can be controlled
    by using remote computers to carry out the tasks of physical security and agriculture.
    Drones can also provide effective help to track deforestation and monitor environmental
    parameters such as air and water quality. Furthermore, small tracking devices,
    which can be monitored through drones, are used to observe and quantify endangered
    species. Smart drones must be designed to achieve the convergence of four aspects
    which are data, connectivity, services, and type of devices used. Smart drones
    are being used to support first responders’ tasks, document accident scenes, and
    monitor construction sites, and therefore, drones are poised to become an integral
    network part of smart cities. By promising a connected society and cheap storage,
    processing, and robotics, drones are leading the way toward a revolution in smart
    cities. B. Drone, ICT, and IoT for Smart Cities Information and Communication
    Technologies (ICT) have evolved into a diverse ecosystem, which combines robots,
    sensors, communication technologies, software, humans and real-time processing.
    For instance, Amsterdam is using ICT for maintaining a sustainable lifestyle,
    while London is using ICT to process waste and ensure proper utilization of resources.
    Furthermore, ICT plays a vital role in improving smart cities, but the security
    challenges need to be managed because of their inherent part of ICT [59]–[61].
    Drone technology is the future of IoT and is slated to provide a revolution in
    IoT developments and applications especially in smart cities. Some researchers
    even consider the drone to be an essential IoT device [62], [63]. Furthermore,
    IoT devices have also been used to enhance the potential tasks of swarm drones
    for providing autonomous cooperation [64]. With the advances in ICT, IoT presents
    a high potential to bolster economic and environmental sustainability [9]. These
    hot and green technologies, such as machine to machine (M2M) communications, sensors,
    RFID, 5G cellular networks, etc., make the cities greener and smarter [14]. An
    evaluation of the impact of ICT on important issues with environmental concerns
    (e.g. power consumption and CO2 emissions) was presented in [21], [65]. 1) Drones
    and RFID RFID is considered one of the most promising wireless communication systems
    used to enable IoT. Furthermore, it does not need LoS and can map the real world
    into a visual map very easily [66]. RFID devices can be classified as passive
    and active [66]. RFID plays a vital role that helps the world to be greener by
    reducing the emissions of the vehicle, saving energy and improving waste disposal,
    etc. Reducing the size of RFID tags and producing energy efficient algorithms
    for optimizing tag estimation are required for green RFID [66]–[70]. Hubbard et
    al. [48] discussed the combination of drone and RFID technologies, and focused
    on enhancing the lifetime of drone battery and RFID reader detection range. The
    advantage of combining drones and RFID is the provision of additional information
    that can be implemented in supply chain management systems. Similarly, the authors
    of [49] proposed a feasibility analysis of how it is possible to recharge a multipurpose
    RFID tag using a drone in an environmental monitoring operations. Furthermore,
    the study in [50] presented a solution for monitoring operation in harsh environments
    using RFID with a drone. It proposed a set of RFID tags that can be equipped with
    various sets of sensors and distributed over the monitored area with a reader
    installed on the drone. The main idea of using a drone is to collect data from
    the RFID sensors scattered throughout the area by directly approaching them, flying
    above them, and downloading measured data [50]. Previous findings show that the
    system works coherently and tags can be powerful monitoring instruments, especially
    where the monitoring is needed for a large area or a harsh environment. Choi et
    al. [51] studied the drone indoor localization technique using passive Ultra-High
    Frequency (UHF) far-field RFID systems. The study aimed to achieve simple and
    cost efficient for drone tracking and localization. 2) Drones and Sensors A sensor
    node is a combination of an enormous number of small sensing devices, power sources,
    processing equipment and communication unit(s), which has been discussed in detail
    in [71]. Sensor nodes are being deployed around the world to measure local and
    global environmental conditions. They have limited power and low processing as
    well as small storage capacity, while Base Station (BS) node is powerful. Each
    sensor node reads parameters such as temperature, sound, pressure, humidity, acceleration,
    etc from its surroundings. Sensors also communicate with each other and deliver
    the needed sensory data to the BS using ad-hoc technology. Mehmood and Song [72]
    discussed smart energy, efficient routing communication protocols for WSN concerning
    the design trade-offs. WSNs have been used in various applications in smart cities
    such as fire detection [73]–[75], object tracking [76]–[78], environmental monitoring
    [52], [71], [79], [80], routing and load-balancing [81], [82], evolving constraints
    in the military [83], control and monitoring of machine health, and industrial
    process monitoring [71]. The idea of green IoT has arisen for keeping sensor nodes
    in sleep mode for most of their life to save energy [84], [85]. WSNs can be realized
    very simply when data communication occurs at ultra-low power. Sensors can utilize
    energy harvested directly from the environment such as the sun, vibrations, kinetic
    energy, temperature differentials, etc. [86]–[88]. Therefore, green WSN is an
    emerging concept in which the lifespan and throughput performance are maximized
    while the CO2 emissions are reduced. The goal of WSN is to supply sufficient energy
    to enhance the system lifetime and contribute to reliable/robust transmission
    without compromising the overall QoS. Zhao et al. [89] proposed a QoS routing
    path selection scheme for wireless community mesh networks in which the quality
    of the channel is monitored and can be used to enhance the communication efficiency
    in smart cities. The study detailed in [11] proposed an optimization method for
    the implementation for an energy efficient and scalable IoT. The technique introduces
    a hierarchical network design, a model for the energy efficient IoT and a minimum
    energy consumption transmission algorithm to implement the optimal model. The
    results show that the technique is more energy efficient and flexible than the
    traditional WSN technique and consequently it can be implemented for efficient
    communication in the green IoT. Similarly, to improve energy efficiency of WSNs,
    the authors of [90] investigated a technique that showed a significant improvement
    in energy savings and reduced the delays. In addition to the work of [11], [90],
    the study in [91] focused on increasing the energy efficiency, extending the network’s
    lifetime, reducing of some relay nodes, and reducing the system budget for green
    IoT. The work was implemented in four steps. First, a hierarchical system framework
    was created and sensor/actuator nodes, relay nodes, and BS were placed. The second
    step was node clustering. The third step was the creation of an optimization model
    to realize IoT, and finally, the fourth step was the calculation of minimal energy
    among the nodes. The findings show that the proposed approach is pliable, energy-saving
    and cost-effective when compared with the existing WSNs deployment scheme. Furthermore,
    the study in [92] investigated wireless energy harvesting, the wake-up radio scheme,
    and error control coding to enable solutions for enhancing the performance of
    green WSNs while reducing their carbon footprint. IoT sensor networks are required
    for a large number of sensors deployed over large areas. The collection of data
    from each sensor in an IoT based sensor network is difficult as it generates a
    tremendous volume of sensing data and requires drones to follow along long routes
    resulting in high energy consumption, higher delays, and exposure to hazardous
    environments. Therefore, the use of drones has been proposed for IoT sensor networks.
    To enhance the functionality of the drones, Malaver et al. [93] presented the
    development of integration of a WSN and a drone-powered by solar energy to improve
    their versatility for different applications. The CO2 concentration was also monitored
    in real-time during data collection by using the integrated system. This system
    was applicable and recommended for different applications such as agriculture,
    mining studies, bush-fires, and zoological and botanical studies [94]. Furthermore,
    the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO) was used to analyze data gathered
    by the integrated system [95]. Also, the collection data with low power and a
    large coverage area using a particular integrated system was discussed in [52].
    During a data gathering process, data may take two paths. First, data can be transmitted
    from the sensors at the ground to the airborne drone. Then, this data is sent
    from the drone to the central analysis station. The bandwidth allocation and energy
    allocation for sensing and transmitting data in the two steps have been considered
    and discussed [53]. Therefore, the combination of drones and WSNs can provide
    a solution for the utilization of energy resources. Drones have the capability
    to control the mode of the sensor network node (sleep or active) for energy efficiency.
    Furthermore, it has been shown that the cooperation of WSNs and smart drones was
    energy efficient, providing a better battery lifetime [54]. 3) Drones and 5G Green
    wireless communication plays a crucial role in green IoT. Green communications
    and networking refer to sustainable, energy-aware, energy-efficient, and environmentally-a
    ware technologies. The idea of a green communication network refers to low CO2
    emissions, low exposure to radiation and energy efficiency. Koutitas et al. [96]
    proposed a genetic algorithm optimized for developing network planning, where
    the findings showed significant reduction in carbon emissions, and cost savings
    and low exposure to radiation. In the same direction, Naeem et al. [97] discussed
    how to maximize the data rate, and minimize CO2 emissions in cognitive WSNs. The
    desig of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has also been proposed to decrease
    energy consumption [98]. The investigated details of the energy efficiency of
    5G mobile communication networks were discussed from three aspects theoretical
    models, technological developments, and applications in [99]. Regarding the next-generation
    network (NGN), Abrol et al. [100] presented the influences, and the growing technologies
    along with the need for energy efficiency. The need for adopting energy efficiency
    and reducing carbon footprint is to fulfill the demands for increasing the capacity,
    enhancing the data rate and providing a high QoS for the NGN. Many types of research
    have been done to save energy by using solar power, and these have also led to
    an enhanced QoS [101]–[106]. Furthermore, the utility-based adaptive duty cycle
    (UADC) algorithm has been proposed to reduce delay, increase energy efficiency,
    and elongate the battery lifetime [107]. The hypertext transfer protocol was used
    to enhance the lifetime and shorten the delay to provide reliable service [108].
    The application of network coding based communication techniques and reliable
    storage was shown to be useful for saving energy for green IoT [109]. The energy
    consumed was minimized by using networked fog centers, the TCP/IP protocol, and
    intra-fog communication [110]. Nowadays, 5G is expected to impact our environment
    and life considerably, in a manner similar to what the IoT promised, to make it
    efficient and comfortable. The 5G applications and its services for our society
    include e-health, robotic communication, interaction of humans and robotics, media,
    transport and logistics, e-learning, e-governance, public safety, automotive and
    industrial systems, etc. The authors of [110], [111] discussed the intelligent
    techniques that are in use for robotic communication to perform tasks effectively
    and efficiently. Chan et al. [112] developed a set of models for evaluating the
    use-phase of power consumption and CO2 emissions of wireless telecommunication
    network services. Furthermore, Motlagh et al. [16] proposed a steering technique
    among multiple 4G networks to ensure reliable and efficient connectivity via drones,
    which supports high QoS and consumes an acceptable amount of energy. Xu et al.
    [55] proposed a single drone as a mobile sink, along with a cluster of sensor
    nodes, and focused on reducing message delays. On the other hand, as energy supply
    on drones is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute towards the
    greening of the network [113]. Therefore, the drone is an emerging and useful
    technique for delivering wireless services to users on the ground, and it is lucrative
    for applications demanding a large coverage area and reduced power consumption.
    The most prominent issues in the next generation heterogeneous network are the
    capacity and coverage. To increase the capacity and coverage of wireless networks,
    Sharma et al. [114] presented an intelligent solution using a drone for accurate
    and efficient placement. The authors of [58] summarized many aspects of communication
    using drones. They investigated the self-adaptive power allocation technique for
    drones based on the minimum data rate and maximum allowable interference. Furthermore,
    technology enabling a drone to be used in a 5G communication network was also
    introduced. The findings showed that drone technology helped to maintain the QoS
    for all users in the drone coverage area. Statistical propagation for predicting
    the path loss between the drone and the terrestrial terminal was given [115].
    The authors of [116] also discussed the prediction of path loss based on the urban
    environment. Mozaffari et al. [18] proposed the coexistence of a drone with another
    IoT device on the ground based on the machine-to-machine (M2M) communication network.
    The integration of a drone and WSN is a useful technology for the utilization
    of energy resources [54], [117]. In addition to cooperation and integration of
    drones and WSN, authors in [56] considered the communication links between drones
    and WSN to optimize scheduling and drone trajectory for minimizing the energy
    consumption in the WSN during data collection. The idea was supported by a study
    in [57], which reveals that transmission energy reduced because the drone is capable
    of moving sequentially close to each node of the WSNs and collecting data from
    them. Rashed et al. [118], [119] highlighted a trade-off between minimizing the
    operation time and maximizing the covered nodes to choose the specific mobility
    pattern. Several studies of the combination of advanced technologies such as drones,
    ICT, and IoT are summarized in Table 2. TABLE 2 Summary on Combination of Drone,
    ICT, and IoT for Smart Cities SECTION III. Privacy and Security Issues in Drones
    and IoT Collaboration Smart cities can not be considered truly smart unless the
    security and privacy concerns of the users have reached an acceptable level. There
    are several challenges in the privacy and security to be addressed for improving
    the smartness of smart cities. Several privacy and security issues solutions and
    challenges have been discussed for different smart city applications in [120],
    [121]. Furthermore, the authors of [121] identified two types of security mechanisms
    in smart cities, operation security and data security, in which the security of
    the data itself depends on the security of the operations. Furthermore in [120],
    smart city applications were introduced, and several security challenges were
    discussed such as secure information processing, privacy leakage, and dependability
    in control. The authors of [122] introduced the security and privacy issues in
    the integration of IoT devices for smart cities. It was deemed essential to guarantee
    the security of end users and information of private and public systems such as
    smart grids and smart mobility. Gong et al. [123] proposed a homomorphic encryption
    technique to guarantee transmission security and evaluate next-generation mobile
    edge computing. Also, Eckhoff and Wagner [59] discussed the applications areas,
    attackers and their data sources, privacy, enabling technologies of a smart city.
    Parvez et al. [60] introduced machine learning (ML) techniques to secure the smart
    grid. For privacy in smart cities, Eckhoff and Wagner [59] introduced the taxonomies
    of privacy for different applications, potential attackers, enabling technologies
    and data sources for attacks. Furthermore, they described the existing privacy
    enhancement technologies in real smart cities and discussed the solutions of various
    challenges. The authors of [35] presented the citizen’s privacy concept based
    on five privacies dimension, viz. identity, location, query, footprint, and owner.
    Several technologies were proposed and combined for enhancing citizen privacy
    in smart cities. The privacy dimensions of smart cities are shown in Table 3.
    TABLE 3 Privacy Dimensions Smart cities include a large number of IoT devices
    such as sensors, cameras, actuators RFID, etc., which are used for data collection
    and transferring the collected data via advanced wireless communication technologies
    into the data center (server) allowing data to be processed and intelligent actions
    to be taken accordingly. Millions of smart IoT devices are distributed in smart
    cities to collect data from different applications, but these devices usually
    have limited computational power which leads to weak cryptography and issues in
    data security. The collected data includes the history of the environment surrounding
    IoT devices. Based on collected data, smart cities can be monitored in real time,
    and intelligent services can be delivered as needed. However, such collected data
    from different applications of smart cities dictates the need for privacy and
    security in order to control smart cities facilities and people’s lives. Otherwise,
    any compromised device may make the entire data collection vulnerable. To keep
    IoT devices in smart cities secure, they should be located in places where unauthenticated
    persons can not reach and access. Furthermore, the IoT network infrastructure
    should be authenticated to collect or send data in a particular network. Gharaibeh
    et al. [37] discussed the integration of various technologies for enabling smart
    cities such as IoT, cloud computing and communication network technologies. Furthermore,
    they identified the techniques applicable for data privacy and security that are
    protected by underlying IoT devices in smart cities. Furthermore, the authors
    of [38] reviewed the security aspects of smart cities and introduced privacy and
    security challenges. They focused on the unique challenges to smart cities applications
    such as smart grids, smart mobility, and IoT. In order to maintain privacy and
    security in smart cities, the authors of [124] proposed an architecture based
    on IoT and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The three general data properties
    that need to be secured for information collected in smart cities, are the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability (CIA) of the data [125]. Further detail is provided
    in Table 4. TABLE 4 Attack Categories in Smart Cities A smart city is not only
    about connected IoT devices and vehicle mobility and their networks, but also
    contains dynamic aspects such as autonomous drones. The security of autonomous
    swarm drones when performing tasks over smart cities was discussed [39]. The authors
    of [39] proposed the SHARK protocol for secured autonomous and heterogeneous swarm
    drones for ensuring the security of swarm drone applications over smart cities.
    Also, the authors of [126] explored a novel solution for securing information
    sharing (and provided a 3D visualization) between swarm drones in a smart city.
    The findings of the proposed technique showed the security prowess of drone context
    exchange validation and provided a secured path for drone to drone collaboration.
    The authors of [127] focused on the examination of cyber security aspects of drone-assisted
    public safety networks in light of the fact that sensitive data could be sent
    over the drone network. The findings showed that security risks and attacks still
    existed. Many studies have discussed drone path attacks such as [128], [129].
    The authors of [130] discussed the dependency of drones on GPS which may get attacked
    and lead to the loss of drone control. For smart cities, drones cyber-attacks
    can be divided into the categories of revelation, knowledge, and disruption as
    shown in Fig. 4. There are several security issues related to drones applications
    in smart cities such as drone-hijacking, waypoint alterations, and signal jamming.
    FIGURE 4. Steps of a typical multi-step cyber-attack on drones. Show All With
    limitless civilian applications, drones need various levels of security features
    according to the type of application. One study [131] provided details of the
    security faults in civilian drones applications such as unsecured WiFi, openly
    accessible Telnet, etc. Furthermore, Pleban et al. [132] highlighted the importance
    of securing communication links with encryption. They classified threats in two
    groups device threats and communication threats. Both of the above studies found
    that civilian drones do not apply cryptographic techniques to secure the connecting
    link between the ground controller and drones. Therefore, civilian drones are
    susceptible to connection denial, remote hijacking, video interception and total
    control (takeover) by adversaries [131]. The authors of [133] proposed the verifierBee
    path planning technique for securing the drones positions and finding the shortest
    path. Furthermore, the authors of [134] introduced future directions and challenges
    for drone safety, security, and privacy in smart cities. It needs to be pointed
    out that securing drones does not only involve securing the communication channel,
    drone environment, and path. Efforts must also be made to secure the controller
    because it is also prone to attacks. Clarke [36] reviewed the drone controls,
    co-regulation, self-regulation and formal laws for various form of surveillance.
    He also identified the shortfall of the regulation framework.Namely, if the controller
    fails to handle the attack, the total drone communication system will be uncontrollable.
    Thus, the authors of [135] proposed an efficient linearly homomorphic authenticated
    encryption technique for controlling multiple drones in real-time operation to
    ensure that they fly autonomously and safely. The proposed technique ensures security
    against forgery and eavesdropping attacks, and therefore, it guarantees the successful
    operation of a multi-rotor flying robot successfully. Also, the authors of [134]
    introduced the issues of privacy, security, and safety in civilian drones. Furthermore,
    they identified the salient drone properties required for secured operation. Interestingly,
    the Internet of Drones (IoD) environment represents a major and emerging technology
    that has enormous civilian applications in smart cities due to real-time data
    access and data accuracy. Several issues regarding security and privacy of the
    IoD environment were discussed in [136]–[138]. It is typically not prudent to
    allow a user direct access to the IoD, as this would give users with malicious
    intentions several chances to attack the IoD environment, for example, through
    jamming, clogging, and hacking [136]. Therefore, the authors discussed how the
    user should access the data collected from the IoD environment in the server securely.
    The server could be placed between the drones and the users, so that users cannot
    access the data from a drone directly, but it can be done via the server to protect
    the IoD environment from attacks. However, some times, the data collected on the
    server is not real-time data. Therefore, the user needs to access the real data
    in the drone environment, so that the user can make intelligent decisions in real-time
    to save people’s life during emergencies. Thus, designing an efficient, secure
    technique for user authentication in IoD is required. An authentication key agreement
    technique was proposed to allow users to directly access the IoD environments
    [138]. Furthermore, Lin et al. [137] provided potential solutions for privacy
    leakage, flexible accessibility and data confidentiality protection, and also
    discussed the architecture needed to gather data with privacy and security in
    the IoD environment. Also, Choudhary et al. [139] proposed a deep neural network
    (DNN) based security framework which provides highly secure and reliable mechanisms
    for IoD. The collaboration of drones and IoT technologies such as RFID, M2M, WSN,
    cloud computing and advanced communication technologies expands the role of collaborative
    drones for many applications in smart cities. Baig et al. [140] surveyed the vulnerabilities
    and associated threats of smart cities and identified components such as building
    automation systems, smart grids, smart vehicles and drones with IoT and cloud
    enabling technologies. Also, the authors of [63] discussed a solution for the
    privacy and security of drone applications in smart cities enabled by 5G and IoT.
    Furthermore, they introduced the security and privacy challenges of collaborative
    drones and IoT, end-to-end (E2E) privacy, prevention and security in real time,
    and the dynamic IoT environment. Ensuring the security off collaborative drones
    and IoT devices in smart cities is complex tasks due to the requirement for an
    efficient combination of various techniques that are associated with drone operations
    and IoT networking aspects. The complexity of collaborative drones and IoT set-ups
    can be enormous, with people and machines interacting with each other in smart
    cities through the complex processes of the ecosystem [134]. In light of this,
    security aspects of IoT along with dronesrequire different techniques for different
    layers such as the perception, link, network and application layers. In the perception
    layer, security threats are mostly related to the possibility of physical damage,
    so the authors of [134], [141] suggested hardware techniques that should be employed,
    such as tamper protection and break-in detection systems. Table 5 illustrates
    the various security threats and the data resources that need protection for drone
    and IoT collaborations. Here, the security involves authorizing the users to access
    data generated by physical objects. Furthermore, E2E communication needs to be
    present to ensure security using advanced techniques such as digital signature
    and lightweight cryptography. In the case of detection systems, co-location proofs
    were proposed to act against routing attacks by [142], [143]. The authors of [143]
    discussed the security services applied in the link layer including E2E security,
    while the authors of [144] proposed secure channel protocols to ensure robust
    communication. TABLE 5 Security Threats and Data Sources in a Drone and IoT Collaborative
    Environment For securing the network layers of drone and IoT collaborative set-ups,
    the authors of [134] discussed secure routing, IP security, and secure transportation.
    Furthermore, the authors of [145] discussed how IPv6 routing could apply for secure
    drones and IoT collaboration for low power protocols [146]. Moreover, routing
    of the data network infrastructure for drone security can provide robust identification
    and ensure objects integrity, as reported in [147]. Such routing can enhance a
    drone’s autonomy, lower its energy consumption, and improve its flying time. On
    the other hand, securing the application layer calls for several techniques such
    as a simple object access protocol, a constrained application protocol [142] and
    intrusion detection systems [148]. Lastly, for drone destination identification,
    path planning, and self-organization, machine learning based computer vision and
    video processing techniques are required [149]. SECTION IV. Drone and IoT Collaboration
    for Energy Efficiency The drone is a critical technology for enabling green IoT
    which will provide energy efficient solutions by minimizing power consumption
    in IoT devices. Standalone IoT devices need high transmission power for sending
    information over long distances. Once the IoT devices are made to collaborate
    with a drone, the agile and flying drone can physically go to the vicinity of
    these IoT devices to collect, process, and transmit data to other nodes/stations
    which are outside the coverage area of the IoT devices. Drones will also use efficient
    communication technologies to transfer/exchange data with each other and with
    IoT devices in the ground through M2M communication. The authors of [150] proposed
    a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for drone-assisted IoT sensor networks based on the sensor
    density, energy consumption and flight time and fly risk level. Furthermore, Mozaffari
    et al. [151] evaluated and argued the optimal altitude values for small drone
    cell clouds which lead to the minimum transmit power and maximum coverage area.
    Incorporating the processing and controlling features in each machine is the primary
    objective of IoT equipment. IoT devices in drones are used to manage, process,
    and deliver data. The co-operative framework for the drone-WSN was introduced
    [117]. It is composed of fixed-group leaders, sensor nodes, and drones-sink. The
    finding of this study was that the energy consumption and complexity of the process
    of group leader election were reduced. The strategies of drone-based WSN for gathering
    data were discussed in [152]. The employed strategies were able to reduce energy
    consumption, flying time and latency of data collection. The authors in [153]
    proposed an algorithm for data gathering in WSNs by employing two technologies:
    mobile agents and drones. Both technologies were used for saving time and energy
    of sensor nodes. A case study was done based on searching for people in a disaster
    (e.g. an earthquake). Also, the proposed work appears to be suitable for gathering
    data in many applications in real smart cities also. Zorbas et al. [156] discussed
    the mathematical formulation of efficient energy management for IoT devices. The
    model was able to detect the events that happened on the ground and minimize energy
    consumption in a particular coverage area. Furthermore, Sharma et al. [54] proved
    the importance of drone and WSN cooperation for providing energy efficient relaying.
    The findings showed that the proposed technique was able to enhance drone routing
    with less delay and a large coverage area with better battery lifetime. The required
    power for the drone system was modeled and it was found that the energy efficiency
    can be improved only by adding more energy efficient components in the emerging
    technologies [157]. Choi et al. [158] determined the energy efficiency of the
    drone-based relay by taking into account the speed and load factors. A wired drone
    docking system has also been proposed to perform many functions through collaboration
    with IoT devices to reduce resources, energy wastage and to also ensure security
    [154]. Seo et al. [159] proposed the use of drone technology over the IoT security
    platform, for monitoring and providing an emergency response in buildings by utilizing
    beacons. For addressing issues related to drone battery life, the authors of [155]
    developed an automatic battery replacement mechanism. Automatic battery replacement
    allowed drones to keep working without manual intervention. The proposed practical
    work successfully assessed the use of drones for continuous surveillance in outdoor
    and indoor environments. A summary of previous studies and techniques used for
    improving the energy efficiency in smart cities by using a collaboration between
    drones and the IoT is shown in Table 6. TABLE 6 Summary on Improving Energy Efficiency
    in Smart Cities SECTION V. Data Collection in Smart Cities Using Collaboration
    of Drones and IoT The most critical asset in a smart city scenario is data. To
    achieve smart city characteristics and cater to the application domains, data
    must be collected, stored, and processed in real-time in order to ensure that
    the required tasks can be performed collaboratively. In many applications of smart
    cities, smart IoT devices (such as cameras, sensors, etc.) are distributed for
    collecting data from the surrounding environment. Smart IoT devices in smart cities
    are small and have limited battery [160]. Therefore, these smart IoT devices are
    not able to transmit the signal over long distances, because of energy constraints
    [12], [13], [17]. To fulfill the promises of eco-friendliness and sustainability
    in smart cities, the reduction of the energy consumption is an absolute necessity,
    and the minimization of pollution and hazardous waste is also required to enhance
    the overall quality of experience [70], [161]. Recently, drones have started to
    represent a microcosm of the entire IoT domain in the sense that these drones
    can interact and respond to their environment much like the other entities in
    the IoT framework. Therefore, they can be deployed to different locations, carry
    flexible loads, measure and provide analytics about anything anywhere and at any
    time. The exciting aspects of drones and IoT collaboration are the lower prices
    and better connectivity and delivery of high QoS. Drone height plays a vital role
    in delivering services to IoT devices and collecting data from IoT devices. Due
    to the advent of drone-based IoT, the IoT equipment on-board a drone may include
    devices such as sensors, digital cameras, actuators, and communication technologies,
    such as Wi-Fi, 5G, LTE, or Ad-hoc networks, as shown in Fig. 5. This equipment
    is used to remotely control the devices, collect data, and deliver services effectively
    and efficiently. Hence, drones can collect data from IoT devices via the equipment
    that has already been added to the drone’s payload. Delivering services from drones
    is performed via wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, LTE, and 5G.
    FIGURE 5. A drone equipped IoT devices for data gathering. Show All Wireless communication
    technologies such as 4G/5G networks offer significant potential for enhancing
    the effectiveness of drones equipped with sensors, cameras, and GPS receivers,
    in delivering IoT services from great heights. Using drones to fly as relays for
    IoT has numerous benefits such as reliability and energy conservation. Drones
    are required to gather data from IoT on the ground to minimize transmission power
    while retaining reliability [17]. Furthermore in such scenarios, the energy consumption
    in IoT devices is significantly reduced, and the drones can serve the ground devices
    for a longer duration. Drones have also been employed to guide search and rescue
    (SAR)teams, where wearable smart devices are connected to drones for guidance
    regarding suitable and safe routes [32]. Furthermore, drones can act as the crucial
    technology component in IoT device communication to collect data from small devices
    such as health-care monitoring equipment, environmental sensors, etc. [160], [162],
    [163]. The authors of [164] considered the use of drones and IoT devices together
    in a disaster response setting and provided the facilities for event detection,
    and automatic network repaired. Smart drones equipped with IoT devices are able
    to collect, store, and process data to enable drones to perform complex tasks
    effectively and efficiently. Because of the energy required for processing IoT
    data and performing IoT tasks urgently, Koulali et al. [165] suggested that the
    processing of data should be done locally, and then the processed data should
    be delivered to the cloud so that the necessary actions can be taken. However,
    the processing and storage of data on IoT devices requires high energy expenditure.
    It is expected that the use of drones will contribute to reducing the energy used,
    and will control the active and sleep modes of IoT devices to produce green IoT
    technology. The various scenarios in which a drone can be effectively used to
    gather data, such as disaster management, public safety, agriculture, etc. are
    summarized in Table 7. Furthermore, drones can be used to gather data in the smart
    cities for many applications such as dynamic coordination and data routing, accident
    monitoring, intelligent transport systems, disaster recovery, public safety, and
    relaying data from isolated ground sensors to a BS, etc. TABLE 7 Summary on Improving
    Data Gathering From Smart Cities The collaboration of drones and IoT for gathering
    data can be leveraged in different ways: (i) drones gathering data from ground
    IoT devices and delivering collected data to the nearest BS [169], (ii) drones
    equipped with IoT devices for gathering data [170] (iii) drone equipped with IoT
    devices and also collecting data from IoT devices in smart cities. For instance,
    drones used for public safety tasks can collect data from wearable devices carried
    by the members of SAR teams. In another case, data gathered by a drone can be
    put to use in the agriculture industry, serving many applications such as crop
    monitoring, drought monitoring, yield estimates, water quality monitoring, disease
    detection, identification of tree species, etc. SECTION VI. Collaboration of Drones
    and IoT for Improving Life Quality Recently, the monitoring and control of air
    pollution have become important issues in the modern industrialized world. Typically
    sensors are used for gathering pollution data which is consumed for monitoring
    purposes. However, the power transmission capabilities of these miniature sensors
    is limited, and often, such sensors are not suitable for sending data in real
    time. To circumvent this issue, the sensors can be carried by drones, and then
    data process and onward transmission can be divided into two parts: the onboard
    sensor can sense/collect pollution data, and the drone’s communication equipment
    with its larger power sources, can easily send the data across over much larger
    distances than those possible using a standalone sensor [171], [172]. In that
    regard, Villa et al. [173] established the best installation points for four gas
    sensors and a Particle Number Concentration (PNC) monitor, onboard a hexacopter.
    They developed a drone system which is capable of measuring point source emissions.
    Their study focused on the air flow behavior, and evaluation of the performance
    of CO2, CO, NO2 and NO sensors for measuring the harmful gaseous emissions in
    a particular geographical area. Several other potential applications of drone
    technology have also been explored for interacting with sensors to perform tasks
    such as soil moisture sensing, remote crop monitoring, infrastructure monitoring,
    water quality monitoring, and remote sensor deployment [174]. For controlling
    the gas emissions from a greenhouse, Hamilton et al. [94] highlighted the importance
    of a solar-powered drone equipped with a CO2 sensing system integrated with a
    WSN. The authors of [175] reviewed the existing drone techniques for monitoring
    the environment. Furthermore, the authors [176] proposed drones equipped with
    off-the-shelf sensors for monitoring tasks, but they did not consider the guidance
    system. To solve this issue, the same authors proposed the adoption of drone-mounted
    pollution control system based on a meta-heuristic and PSO techniques, which allowed
    the user to monitor a specific area and focused on the most polluted zones [177].
    In another pertinent work, [178], the authors proposed using equipment in drones
    such as Pixhawk Autopilot for drone control along with onboard processing and
    storage devices, to sense and store environmental pollution data. Furthermore,
    the authors of [179] developed a modular drone platform that is capable of real-time
    monitoring of multiple air pollutants. Šmídl and Hofman [180] extended the idea
    of mobile stations to autonomously navigated drones for pollution monitoring.
    The work demonstrated the applications of the drone platform in air pollution
    research, focused on roadside air pollution profiling and emergency monitoring
    for air pollution episodes. On the other hand, Zang et al. [181] demonstrated
    the application of drones for the investigation of water pollution in south-west
    China. Drones were shown to be effective in such a climatic scenario because of
    their ability to work in environmental conditions with low air pressure, high
    altitude, severe weather, strong air turbulence, and persistent cloud cover. Gu
    et al. [182] developed and designed a modular drone-based platform which was capable
    of real-time monitoring of air pollution in smart cities. The proposed model included
    drone, sensors, ground station, data acquisition equipment, and a data processing
    module. The proposed system exhibited high precision and was shown to be suitable
    for air pollution monitoring. Furthermore, the authors of [183] designed a long-range
    air quality monitor aboard a drone. The proposed prototype could be used to monitor
    air pollution easily. In this setup, the collaboration between drones was shown
    to be effective in the sense that one drone was sensing the data, and another
    drone was used to send data in real-time to the server. Table 8 depicts a summary
    of the outcomes of the collaboration of drones and IoT for improving life quality
    in smart city. TABLE 8 Summary on Improving Life Quality in Smart Cities SECTION
    VII. Collaborative Drone and IoT for Public Safety in Smart Cities As has been
    discussed earlier, the limited transmission power of miniaturized sensors and
    handheld devices makes them unable to send their captured data over long distances.
    Drone technology, however, can deliver services over a large geographical area
    in real time. The use of drone technology represents the cheapest and most efficient
    way to accomplish tasks such as monitoring a criminal on the run, finding a missing
    person, surveying a disaster scene, etc., especially in time-critical situations.
    Therefore, the best features of collaboration between drone and IoT devices are
    those that are supposed to achieve and provide maximum benefits, such as reprogrammability,
    good sensing capability, ability to interconnect and identify things, ubiquity,
    communication capability, etc. Wearable internet of public safety things (IoPST)
    devices connect in smart cities for public safety and allow first responders to
    share information with command posts and relevant parties. These connected devices
    can help relief and monitoring teams to identify when or where disasters or crimes
    have happened, as shown in Fig. 6. Using this information, the interested parties
    (law enforcement agencies in the case of crimes, rescue teams in the case of disasters)
    can quickly make appreciated decisions in order to track down perpetrators or
    provide aid, whatever the case may be. Figure. 6 shows the capability of a drone
    equipped with IoT technology to capture data in real-time for disaster events
    and send the captured data to the disaster control center to make an appreciate
    decision in real time. Drone 1 is used to capture real information from the disastrous
    fire. Drone 1 is used to communicate with SAR teams, send real-time data about
    the disaster, and guide SAR to reach the disaster area using an accessible and
    safe path. The SAR team members are wearing IoT devices that help the drones to
    identify their location, and suitably guide them according to the disaster situaion.
    Furthermore, drone 1, which happens to be above the disaster area when the tragedy
    occurred can communicate with other drones and forward real-time data. Therefore,
    effective collaboration between drones and IoT devices plays a critical role in
    enhancing the public safety and reducing the impact of disaster in smart city.

    examples of collaborative drones and IoT in smart cities. Show All The authors
    of [18] analyzed how the deployment of a drone as a BS could deliver communication
    services to a particular area. Furthermore, the coexistence between heterogeneous
    devices and drones was discussed. Fundamental operation and techniques were introduced
    for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of public safety network using IoT technologies.
    The authors of [184] reviewed the techniques and the availability of IoT for disaster
    management. Reina et al. [168] outlined the disaster management and the importance
    of using IoT and big data. The study focused on the use of drones as 0 th responders
    to deliver communication service to victims in a disaster. The main idea of an
    0 th responder is to arrive at the disaster area before the first responders.
    The work was divided into two parts: the collection of data and the use of local
    search to find the optimal position in which the drone could deliver communication
    services to the victims. Furthermore, the work in [168] was supported by [185],
    in which the position of the 0 th responder was considered for delivering communication
    services to victims in disaster areas. However, maintaining the connectivity link
    between the 0 th responder and other responders was not discussed. Therefore,
    Alsamhi et al. [14] developed an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the
    signal strength between the drone and wearable IoT devices or other responders
    on the ground to maintain connectivity for delivering services. A concise summary
    of the effects of effective collaboration between drones and IoT devices for public
    safety in smart cities is shown in Table 9. TABLE 9 Summary of Improving Public
    Safety in Smart Cities SECTION VIII. Collaboration of Drone and IoT for Disaster
    Management Apart from the promise of intelligent services, the concept of a smart
    city also encapsulates effective and efficient planning towards responses to emergency
    and critical situations. This is generally achieved by assigning SAR activities
    to disaster areas in real time. In this context, using AI techniques for image
    analytics plays a vital role in identifying things and events in real time. Visual
    records of disaster areas can have significant effects on the selection of an
    effective disaster response. In that light, Chaudhuri and Bose [186] examined
    the effectiveness of the machine learning technique to manage disasters in smart
    cities. The proposed technique was used to classify images, containing photographs
    of disaster areas, with high accuracy. Sakhardande et al. [187] utilized the various
    communication modes of IoT devices to monitor and manage the SAR activities during
    a disaster. Furthermore, the idea of intelligent transportation with the help
    of cloud computing and VANETs technologies has also been proposed for disaster
    management systems in smart cities [188]. Also, Boukerche et al. [189] proposed
    an IoT based disaster response and detection system for improving SAR activities
    during a disaster. In this context, IoT devices were used for data gathering,
    localing injured people, and identifying hazards. The architecture of the proposed
    system included smart sensors, smart processing, smart responses, and an ad hoc
    communication network. Collaboration among drones and IoT devices such as cameras,
    sensors, and actuators can be used for disaster management and SAR guiding by
    providing high-resolution imagery, and videos of the affected area and extended
    coverage area as well as providing real-time weather records (e.g. wind speed,
    pollution levels, temperature, etc.). Drones flying over or closer to a disaster
    area can communicate amongst themselves, as well as with a central station, to
    facilitate the coordination and surveillance of the event and operations team
    [26]. Real-time processing of the collected data by IoT devices is needed to identify
    the most affected areas and to assist people where human intervention is risky,
    impossible, dangerous, and expensive. A drone equipped with IoT devices can be
    used to collect data from disaster area and its surroundings. Collected data will
    help rescue and relief teams to respond accordingly to ensure tasks are performed
    efficiently. Aljehani et al. proposed drone technology together with IoT devices
    for enabling mobile tracking and image processing [190]. The advanced technology
    was used to capture an image of the disaster event. Image data from a drone helped
    to evaluate damaged areas. A drone equipped with IoT devices such as 3D cameras
    can be used to capture high-resolution images to make relief maps of the region
    under consideration. In this way, a disaster center receives explicit footage
    of the actual scene without having to deploy human/robot ground teams. Also, a
    drone can penetrate places that would otherwise be difficult for rescue teams
    or helicopters to enter and provide close-up views. The most important advantage
    of the map is to understand the impact of the disaster on the region. Afterwards,
    AI techniques can be used for decision making and taking desired actions based
    on the captured map. The desired signal strength from the drone is optimized using
    an ANN [14]. The prediction and estimation of the signal strength is important
    for enhancing the QoS. Furthermore, appropriate communication protocols are required
    for disaster management, because disaster types have different notions of occurrence,
    damage ability, and time mishap. The energy efficiency of IoT protocols plays
    a vital role in discovering local sensor devices and gateways for delivering communication
    services in such a power constrained scenario. Timing is everything in a disaster
    situation. By incorporating IoT data into emergency response plans, public sector
    agencies and responders can use real-time information to make arrangements and
    reach the people who need help. In the case of IoT wearable devices worn by SAR
    teams, the drone can assist the IoT services by carrying sensors, cameras, and
    communication devices, etc. For example, response teams can also use wearable
    sensors for coordination, analytics, outreach strategies, and on-the-ground tactics.
    Also, the drone may also be used as a gateway which can connect to the monitoring
    server as well as, controlling different IoT devices on the drone itself. Furthermore,
    it can carry IoT devices such as thermal imaging devices, multispectral cameras,
    microphones, and sniffers. Motlagh et al. [16] established a steering mechanism
    on the drone payload to decrease the energy consumption and guarantee a higher
    data transmission rate through proper selection of the received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI). The performance of the steering mechanism led to an increase
    in the probability of having a high transmission data rate, high QoS, and acceptable
    energy consumption.Regarding flexible deployment of drone technology, 4G communication
    will help to control multiple drones from anywhere, enabling real-time data transmission,
    processing, and sharing. The work in [191] considered the deployment of drone
    and IoT devices during a disaster for effective and efficient communication and
    data sensing, and the use of integrated technology to help SAR to perform their
    tasks safely. Application areas of such systems include transportation, public
    safety, energy, healthcare, and telecommunication. Table 10 shows a summary of
    previous studies related to collaborative drone and IoT technologies for disaster
    management in smart cities. TABLE 10 Summary on Improving Disaster Management
    in Smart Cities Figure. 6 shows the importance of using drones in collaboration
    with IoT devices for disaster management in smart cites. Drone 1 is equipped with
    IoT sensors to capture data in real-time and forward it to a central unit for
    further decision making and the performance of intelligent actions. Furthermore,
    drone 1 is also used to connect directly with the wearable IoT devices worn by
    the SAR team to guide them along a safe path and protect their lives. SECTION
    IX. Miscellaneous Applications of Collaboration of Drones and IoT Smart cities
    demand smart data. IoT devices are capable of collecting this data. However, distributing
    a massive number of IoT devices will consume energy and incur high costs. Therefore,
    smart drones can be equipped with IoT devices, which can be used to collect data
    from a large coverage area with energy savings and reduced carbon emissions. In
    the near future, a massive number of drones will be used to improve city life,
    document accident scenes, support first responder activities, and monitor construction
    sites. The requirements of drones to make a city smarter were discussed in [34],
    [192], [193]. The authors of [34] associated a critical role to the drone in smart
    cities, wherein the drone was used as a relay station and kept connectivity in
    particular applications such as emergency services and disaster recovery. Furthermore,
    the future directions of research and challenges were discussed in that work.
    Won et al. [194] discussed the need for secure communication protocols for collaboration
    between drones and IoT devices. The protocols involve different types of fixed
    IoT devices or mobile devices with different capacities. The various aspects of
    drones in future smart cities, relating to cyber-security, privacy, and public
    safety were discussed in [28]. Furthermore, the applications of drones for smart
    cities and the opportunities to solve todays problems were also discussed in [41],
    [194]. Recently, the rate of crime in urban areas, such as street crime, vandalism,
    and terrorism has increased. Therefore, anticipating crimes through detection
    and recognition of criminals among crowds of people is vital. In this vein, drones
    with the help of IoT devices can be used to track, detect, and recognize criminals,
    follow criminal movement to discover exact hiding places, and provide immunity
    from any potential hazards that the criminals may pose. To improve the performance
    of disaster sensing while saving energy, the drone-cloud framework was proposed
    for disaster sensing applications under the condition of irregular, intermittent,
    and limited environment networks [195]. In another related work, it was argued
    that providing excellent accuracy is sufficient for real-time disaster relief
    [196]. The use of drones to provide various services was also discussed in [197].
    To secure a smart home, a drone can provide adaptive security by working as a
    home surveillance system. It would use solar-powered sensors to detect physical
    movement, any acoustic signal, and even vibrations on the ground, and would be
    capable of approaching and monitoring the areas of interest once a further investigation
    command is given. Also, apart from the possibility of using solar-powered equipment,
    wireless power transmission techniques can be used to charge the batteries of
    drones and IoT devices in the drone payload. Collaborative drones and IoT devices
    also promise a revolution in agriculture through the combination of big data,
    aerial imagery, and other means to optimize productivity. Wang et al. [174] explored
    several potential applications where drones interact with sensor tags to perform
    tasks such as soil moisture sensing, remote crop monitoring, infrastructure monitoring,
    water quality monitoring, and remote sensor deployment. In their work, a drone
    was equipped with IoT devices and included the capability for seamless connection
    and data collection in the cloud. Collaborative drones and IoT devices can also
    help to monitor power distribution lines, tend to crops, or deliver packages.
    Nowadays, another significant field and application of collaborative drones and
    IoT is doing the often dangerous work of power crews in surveying storm damage
    or maintaining power lines. Therefore, collaboration between drones and IoT devices
    can be used to find and inspect downed power lines faster than manned crew members
    after a storm or hurricane. Furthermore, drones can cover a larger area much faster,
    while keeping crews out of danger. In this particular case, drones can send real-time
    data and live video streams back to smart grid systems, allowing power companies
    to manage potential electrical problems like never before. Therefore, drones reduce
    both inspection time and cost. Collaboration between drones and IoT devices can
    also provide a viable solution for tasks such as the delivery of food aid and
    medical supplies to areas hit by a disaster. Nowadays, humans are probably most
    interested in collaborations between drones and IoT to save people’s lives during
    public safety and emergencies. Therefore, future collaborations of drones and
    wearable/implantable medical devices will revolutionize healthcare, moving closer
    to a model in which IoT sensors monitor health continuously. If patients are not
    able to travel tens or hundreds of miles to receive a diagnosis, collaborative
    drone and IoT devices can be used to treat them. Table.11 illustrates the applications
    of collaborative drones and IoT and its advantages for smart cities. Some of the
    more pertinent applications are further explained below. TABLE 11 A Summary on
    Collaborative Drones and IoT Applications With the Associated Advantages A. Emergency
    Services and Disaster Management Emergency applications in smart cities are a
    very important factor in saving people lives. Some emergency cases occur in difficult
    to access areas, and delays in physically reaching them may impact the response
    performance. Therefore, collaborative drones and IoT can play vital roles in improving
    the emergency response in smart cities. Drones equipped with sensors can perform
    as zero responders for victims in a very crowded area in smart cities. In this
    case, the drone can send the victim’s location, find a smooth path for SAR, and
    update the situation to an emergency response team, while at the same time also
    monitoring the victim’s status. Also, response teams wear IoT devices that keep
    them in contact with drones. Moreover, collaborative drone and IoT can deliver
    on-demand broadband communication services and collect data about the emergency
    environment [198], [199]. Terrorist attacks and natural and man-made disasters
    are examples of disasters that affect smart cities and represent very challenging
    situations. The Control, management and preparation of such disasters is extremely
    important. The sooner the response reaches the affected area, the higher the reduction
    in the overall cost to the economy will be, and the higher the chance that more
    lives are saved will be. The aerial platform has been proposed as one technology
    that can deliver broadband communication services such as the high altitude platform
    [200], [201],and tethered balloon [200], [202]–[204], while drones have more recently
    been put forward as an even more effective and efficient technology for delivering
    broadband communication in disaster monitoring and mitigation [14], [32], [205],
    [206]. Furthermore, due to their agility, drones can also be used to transport
    equipment, and medical supplies to the needy. B. Data Collection Effective collaborations
    between drones and IoT devices can also be leveraged to gather and transfer data
    in real-time. In conventional techniques, the transfer of collected data usually
    occurs via multi-hops and relays, leading to delays and errors [14], [32]. For
    such cases, collaborative drones play a vital role in collecting data from IoT
    devices and transfering data to the main station [207]. Thus, collaborative drones
    can reduce the energy required by the IoT devices, by reducing the distance over
    which data needs to be transmitted (IoT device to nearby drone, instead of IoT
    device to a far-away base station), and thus extending their battery life [14],
    [21], [208]. Several techniques have been developed for efficient data collection
    and communication between drones and IoT devices [32], [63], [95], [209]. C. Monitoring
    Traffic Traffic congestion is considered one of the major issues facing smart
    cities. It occurs due to sudden increases in the number of vehicles for many reasons
    such as rush hour, construction work, large events, or accidents. It may occur
    at any time in any place in a smart city. Therefore, effective and efficient techniques
    and technologies are required to mitigate such situations. Static cameras installed
    on the streets can provide some information, but not a detailed report about the
    congestion [210]. Drone is a crucial technology for collecting congestion data
    and sending it in real time. Several techniques have been used for efficient and
    effective communication and exploration of the data collected by drones, such
    as those presented in [14], [32], [211], [212]. Traffic congestion can also occur
    due to trying to find park spots when there are limited parking spaces. This causes
    drivers to navigate the area several times at low speed. To help in such scenarios,
    D’Aloia et al. [213] proposed drones technology to map the parking area and finding
    empty parking spots. Therefore, collaborative drones and IoT devices in vehicles
    help the driver to find empty parking spots quickly. D. Crowd Monitoring and Security
    In smart cities, drones can assist policemen in security measures and safety enforcement.
    Due to the easy deployment of drones, they can be deployed rapidly to gather real-time
    data and support police operations in various cases such as robbery or traffic
    hit-and-runs [214]. Collaborative drones and IoT technologies such as human behavior
    recognition [215], motion detection [216] etc. can also help make cities smarter.
    Such collaborations between drones and IoT devices could make the surveillance
    process more effective and less expensive, as compared with a human workforce.
    E. Fog Computing The integration of IoT devices and cloud computing will improve
    many smart cities applications due to the cost reduction and elastic resource
    provision. Clouds can be utilized for the data storage of IoT applications in
    smart cities. However, there are some restrictions on the feasible integration
    of IoT applications and cloud servers, such as the latency/response time, mobility,
    difficulty of adding heterogeneous devices, and issues related to context and
    location awareness. Bonomi et al. [217] proposed a fog computing architecture
    to overcome the above restrictions. The concept of a ‘Fog cloud’ deals with improving
    the basic cloud computing service by offering small platforms placed at the network
    edges i.e. closer to IoT devices. Thus, fog computing provides an easy way to
    access the storage services very close to the actual applications. The response
    time is thereby reduced. Fog computing has been proposed to improve the efficiency
    and effectiveness of operation in many applications such as energy management,
    smart grid, smart building, smart transportation, and city monitoring [218]–[220].
    Interestingly, drone-based fog computing is a new concept that was recently introduced
    in [221], while the collaboration between drones and clouds was discussed in [222],
    [223]. The authors of [221] introduced the advantages of collaborative drones
    to support IoT based fog computing based on drone mobility, flexibility and ease
    of deployment in smart cities. Thus, the collaborative drones can be used to load
    a fixed fog unit, or replace a faulty or lost unit in case of a disaster situation
    to support SAR. SECTION X. Discussion and Future Directions Recently, there have
    been various fruitful efforts towards enhancing the smartness of cities using
    advanced techniques and collaboration between different technologies. Drone technology,
    ML and IoT are key to making smart cities smarter, greener, and more sustainable.
    As has been elaborated throughout this paper, a combination of drones and IoT
    devices could be used to perform the following tasks in a more efficient manner:
    data collection and dissemination, pollution monitoring, security and surveillance,
    traffic de-congestion, the provision of on-demand communication links, emergency
    rescue and response team support, agricultural monitoring, and many others. However,
    before the promised collaboration between drones and IoT devices can be made fully
    functional, there are several open issues that need to be addressed. Table 12
    illustrates the open issues and challenges of collaboration between drones and
    IoT for application in smart cities. Table 13 presents a compilation of the directions
    that future research in this field is expected to take, along with a listing of
    future insights. TABLE 12 Summary of Open Issues of Collaborative Drones and IoT
    Applications in Smart Cities TABLE 13 Research Directions, Challenges, and Insights
    The most pressing issues in this field include prolonging the battery lifetime
    of drones, constructing better and reliable communication protocols between the
    drones and the base stations, improving data security, route planning for the
    drones, and incorporating the capability to deal with a wide variety of heterogenous
    devices and sensors, while improving their present ability to make informed and
    intelligent decisions. Related to toward the development of more intelligent and
    privacy-oriented drones, the use of ML for security with attention to privacy
    is mentioned in [226]. To keep the network secure from cyber-attacks, ML may be
    applied between the IoT framework and drones. ML can also be applied to detect
    attacks during training, and to identify security vulnerability using adversarial
    set-ups [227]–[230]., However, the current techniques do not eliminate all types
    of vulnerabilities. Therefore, advanced research is required to find better solutions
    for securing the collaborative networks of drones and IoT devices. Further to
    that, designing secure authentication techniques for heterogenous collaborative
    environment is another challenge. This issue was first identified by the authors
    of [231], who pointed out several shortfalls in the authentication techniques
    of smart cities. SECTION XI. Conclusion Smart cities are made up of intelligent
    things which can intelligently and automatically collaborate to enhance life quality,
    save peoples lives, and sustain resources. Recently, the advent of drone technology
    has played a vital role in enhancing many real-time applications of smart cities.
    Drones can be equipped with IoT devices, and can also be made to collaborate with
    IoT devices to make civilian life better in numerous ways and to protect our environment.
    The collaboration between drones and IoT has the potential to change our lives
    drastically via data gathering and real-time analysis to enhance life quality,
    lower energy consumption, and provide a high QoS, as well as many other advantages.
    This survey differs from the previous efforts in terms of its breadth, scope,
    and focus. In particular, we have focused on the new concept of the collaboration
    of drones and IoT for improving smart city applications. In doing so, we have
    presented a thorough study on the most recent works on drones and IoT collaboration,
    its importance, and its application domains in smart cities. We have also provided
    concise work challenges and research insights, which should be addressed to further
    enhance the effectiveness of such collaboration. Appendix List of Abbreviationss

    Abstract: Earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) are crucial for saving lives\
    \ in earthquake-prone\nareas. In this study, we explore the potential of IoT and\
    \ cloud infrastructure in realizing a sustainable\nEEWS that is capable of providing\
    \ early warning to people and coordinating disaster response\nefforts. To achieve\
    \ this goal, we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of seismic waves\n\
    and associated signal processing. We then present a detailed discussion of the\
    \ IoT-enabled EEWS,\nincluding the use of IoT networks to track the actions taken\
    \ by various EEWS organizations and the\ncloud infrastructure to gather data,\
    \ analyze it, and send alarms when necessary. Furthermore, we\npresent a taxonomy\
    \ of emerging EEWS approaches using IoT and cloud facilities, which includes\n\
    the integration of advanced technologies such as machine learning (ML) algorithms,\
    \ distributed\ncomputing, and edge computing. We also elaborate on a generic EEWS\
    \ architecture that is sustainable\nand efﬁcient and highlight the importance\
    \ of considering sustainability in the design of such systems.\nAdditionally,\
    \ we discuss the role of drones in disaster management and their potential to\
    \ enhance\nthe effectiveness of EEWS. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the\
    \ primary veriﬁcation and\nvalidation methods required for the systems under consideration.\
    \ In addition to the contributions\nmentioned above, this study also highlights\
    \ the implications of using IoT and cloud infrastructure in\nearly earthquake\

    \ destroyed southern and central Turkey\nas well as northern and western Syria.\
    \ 37 km (23 miles) west-northwest of Gaziantep is\nwhere the epicenter was. The\
    \ earthquake near Antakya, Hatay Province, peaked with a\nMercalli rating of XII\
    \ (Extreme) as mentioned in [1]. The epicenter of the strong earthquake,\nfollowed\
    \ by the one that occurred on February 6 by nine hours, was 95 km (59 miles) to\n\
    the north-northeast of the most recent one. There was signiﬁcant destruction and\
    \ tens of\nthousands of deaths. At least 57,300 fatalities had been reported as\
    \ of 20 March 2023, with\nmore than 50,000 of those occurring in Turkey and more\
    \ than 7200 in Syria [2].\nIt was the deadliest natural disaster in the history\
    \ of Turkey and the largest natural\ndisaster to hit Turkey in modern times since\
    \ the earthquake in Antioch in 526 [3]. Aside\nfrom being the deadliest earthquake\
    \ since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake in modern-day\nSyria, it was also the worst\
    \ earthquake worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the\nsixth deadliest\
    \ of the twenty-ﬁrst century [4]. The fourth-costliest earthquakes on record,\n\
    damages in Turkey were expected to total USD 104 billion, and in Syria, USD 5.1\
    \ billion [5].\nThere are strong correlations between earthquakes, climate changes,\
    \ and mining activi-\nties [6–8]. Many scientists have predicted that the frequency\
    \ of earthquakes will keep increas-\ning [9]. Figure 1 illustrates the location\
    \ of earthquakes that occurred in the last 12 months\nwith intensity larger than\
    \ 7 Moment W-phase (Mww). In [10], the first paper on the idea of\nearthquake\
    \ early warning systems (EEWS) in 1985 was presented. These systems are networks\n\
    of ground-based sensors that alert users when the earth starts to tremble.\nFigure\
    \ 1. Major earthquakes that occurred in the last 12 months as reported in [11].\n\
    EEWS operates under the assumption that, despite the slow speed at which seismic\n\
    waves move, electronic alerts from the epicenter region may be delivered almost\
    \ instantly.\nThe process is as follows:\n1.\nSeveral types of seismic waves radiate\
    \ from an earthquake’s epicenter. Sensors are\nactivated by P-waves, which are\
    \ weaker but move more quickly. Thereafter, sensors\nsend signals to cloud servers\
    \ for processing.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n3 of 38\n2.\nAlgorithms in\
    \ the cloud server instantly determine the location, magnitude, and\nseverity\
    \ of an earthquake. How big is it? Who will suffer from this?\n3.\nThe technology\
    \ sends out an alert before slower but more destructive S-waves and\nsurface waves\
    \ arrive.\nThose who are close to the epicenter will not receive much, if any,\
    \ warning beforehand,\nwhile those who are farther away could only have a few\
    \ seconds to brace themselves. EWS\nmay help reduce some of the injuries and damage\
    \ caused by large earthquakes when used\nin conjunction with automated countermeasures\
    \ such as stopping trains or turning off\ngas lines.\nRecent years have seen a\
    \ signiﬁcant increase in the number of traditional as well as\ncontemporary technology\
    \ utilized in EEWSs [12–14]. As a consequence of this, effective\nintegration\
    \ of the numerous scientiﬁc ﬁelds is sought after in order to serve such crucial\n\
    systems. In general, actions taken to reduce risks, conduct seismic hazard assessments,\n\
    determine site speciﬁcations, and the like can be of assistance in this regard\
    \ [15–19]. De-\nveloping a reliable EEWS necessitates solving a number of issues\
    \ that are impacted by\nthe ongoing difﬁculties associated with earthquake catastrophes.\
    \ These issues include the\nobservation of earthquake characteristics, and the\
    \ environment type [20–25].\nRadio-frequency identiﬁcation, satellite systems,\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT), network\nfunctions virtualization (NFV), 5G, software-deﬁned\
    \ networks (SDN), data networks, and a\nvariety of other technologies have all\
    \ been the focus of signiﬁcant research in recent years in\nan effort to lessen\
    \ the damage that earthquakes cause [26–34]. For instance, satellite systems\n\
    have been used to track earthquake movements, and IoT sensors have been used to\
    \ detect\nearthquakes and provide early warnings. Furthermore, 5G and SDN technologies\
    \ have\nbeen deployed for real-time communication and data transmission in emergency\
    \ situations.\nThese technologies have greatly enhanced the accuracy and speed\
    \ of earthquake detection\nand warning systems and have improved the response\
    \ time of emergency services.\nMoreover, the integration of robots and the internet\
    \ has the potential to be a signiﬁcant\nbreakthrough in this ﬁeld. According to\
    \ [35], a new integrated system named “robot-\nevent” has been proposed, which\
    \ is able to execute autonomous inspections and emergency\nresponses to a severe\
    \ event. The robot uses real-time image tracking to inspect the indoor\nenvironment\
    \ and help any human victims found on the ground. It operates in structurally\n\
    sound houses with moderate damage, focusing on situations where people are at\
    \ risk from\nfalling furniture. The system was tested indoors to assess its functionality\
    \ and operation\nalongside a smart EEWS. This new technology has the potential\
    \ to signiﬁcantly reduce\nthe risk of human casualties during an earthquake by\
    \ providing timely and accurate\ninformation to emergency responders. Future research\
    \ in this area could explore further\nthe use of robotics, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ and the internet to develop more advanced and\nefﬁcient EEWSs.\nThe research\
    \ conducted in the literature regarding remote sensing applications facili-\n\
    tated by satellite communication systems did not cease with the studies by [36,37].\
    \ It also\nencompassed NFV and SDN, which involved gateways via IoT as well as\
    \ Micro-Electro-\nMechanical systems (MEMS), as noted in [38–41]. The primary\
    \ objective of this endeavor\nwas to provide relief to areas that had suffered\
    \ damage or destruction on a large scale.\nVirtualization played a critical role\
    \ in this, as it could help mitigate the risks posed by\nnatural disasters. As\
    \ highlighted in [42], such networks must be designed to optimize\nnode lifetimes.\
    \ In addition, ref. [43] presented a tragic scenario that showcased an EEWS\n\
    designed to facilitate a safe evacuation plan against disaster risks by combining\
    \ cloud-\nbased IoT with heterogeneous networks. Similarly, the combination of\
    \ IoT and current\ncommunication technologies and techniques could prove to be\
    \ crucial in ensuring the\nsmooth and secure transfer of data, as stated in [44–49].\n\
    The studies mentioned here are accompanied by conventional approaches to earth-\n\
    quake detection and analysis, as well as methods for distinguishing between different\n\
    types of fault ruptures, which have been extensively investigated in the relevant\
    \ academic\nliterature [50]. In [51], a local similarity earthquake detection\
    \ approach based on the near-\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n4 of 38\nest neighbor\
    \ method was proposed to determine whether an earthquake had occurred\nby examining\
    \ the consistency of received signals from the nearest neighbors of targeted\n\
    stations and their closest neighbors. On the other hand, refs. [52,53] focused\
    \ more on\ndetermining the earthquake’s amplitude in the ﬁrst few seconds of its\
    \ occurrence rather\nthan the complete rupture. However, conventional methods\
    \ take a signiﬁcant amount of\ntime to calculate earthquake parameters [54], highlighting\
    \ the need for additional efforts\nand studies. Early research suggests that it\
    \ is possible to accurately predict the magnitude\nand depth of an earthquake\
    \ using a graph CNN model that employs batch normalization\nand attention mechanism\
    \ techniques. This model can be used in any location with any\nseismic nodes.\
    \ The variability of seismic waves and the complexity of the Earth’s structure\n\
    suggest that there is ample room for innovative and adaptable solutions. With\
    \ the help\nof modern technologies, the impact of earthquakes on the studied region\
    \ in [54] can be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced.\nAn increasingly useful technology for\
    \ disaster management is drones. They can\nbe used to gather real-time data and\
    \ give emergency responders situational awareness,\nwhich can aid in improved\
    \ decision-making and more efﬁcient responses. Drones with\ncameras and sensors\
    \ can survey disaster regions swiftly and safely, collecting precise\nimagery\
    \ and data that can be used to assess damage, spot areas that require immediate\n\
    attention, and organize rescue and recovery efforts [55]. Drones can also be used\
    \ to transport\npeople in hazardous or hard-to-reach locations necessary goods\
    \ such as food and medical\nsupplies [56]. Drones are an important tool in emergency\
    \ management because they have\nthe potential to greatly speed up and enhance\
    \ the efﬁciency of disaster response efforts.\n5G and B5G networks offer several\
    \ advantages for emergency communication, includ-\ning faster data transmission\
    \ speeds, lower latency, and improved reliability [57–59]. These\nnetworks can\
    \ enable real-time communication between emergency responders and affected\nindividuals,\
    \ as well as the seamless transfer of data and video feeds from IoT devices, such\n\
    as sensors and drones [60–62].\nIn particular, D2D communication can play a crucial\
    \ role in emergency situations, as it\nallows devices to communicate directly\
    \ with each other without relying on a centralized\nnetwork [63,64]. This can\
    \ be especially useful in scenarios where network infrastructure\nmay be damaged\
    \ or overloaded, as D2D communication can operate on a peer-to-peer\nbasis and\
    \ bypass the need for a central network [65,66]. In an earthquake early warning\n\
    system, D2D communication could allow sensors to share data with each other and\
    \ trigger\nalerts in real-time without relying on a centralized system [67,68].\n\
    Edge computing can also be leveraged to enhance the performance of earthquake\n\
    early warning systems [69,70]. By processing data closer to the source, edge computing\
    \ can\nreduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to centralized servers\
    \ and enable\nfaster response times [71,72]. For example, in an earthquake early\
    \ warning system that\nuses drones to collect data, edge computing could be used\
    \ to process the data on the drones\nthemselves, rather than transmitting it back\
    \ to a central server for processing [73,74]. This\nwould not only reduce the\
    \ amount of data that needs to be transmitted but also enable\nfaster response\
    \ times in the event of an earthquake [75].\nCloud computing helps manage disasters.\
    \ Disaster management ﬁrms can swiftly\ndeploy vital apps and services to assist\
    \ emergency response activities using cloud platforms’\nscalability, ﬂexibility,\
    \ and accessibility. Cloud-based technologies can monitor and analyze\ndisaster\
    \ data in real time, helping emergency responders manage resources. Cloud systems\n\
    can store and handle enormous volumes of data, such as maps, satellite imaging,\
    \ and social\nmedia feeds, to help businesses better analyze disasters. Cloud-based\
    \ communication and\ncollaboration solutions can also help rescuers communicate,\
    \ coordinate, and stay linked\nduring the pandemonium. Cloud computing may make\
    \ disaster management businesses\nmore agile, responsive, and effective in saving\
    \ lives and minimizing damage. Fog and edge\ncomputing are distributed computing\
    \ methods that provide computing resources near data\nsources. Fog computing is\
    \ a dispersed computing infrastructure that processes data near\nits source. Edge\
    \ computing brings computing resources to the end-user or device. Fog and\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n5 of 38\nedge computing are important in natural disaster detection\
    \ and control. Natural disasters\ndamage communication networks, making data collection\
    \ and transmission difﬁcult. Fog\nand edge computing provide local data processing\
    \ and analysis without data centers\nor clouds. In the aftermath of a disaster,\
    \ time is of the essence because communication\ninfrastructure may be compromised\
    \ [76–79].\nFor example, sensors deployed in an area prone to ﬂooding can collect\
    \ data on water\nlevels, ﬂow rates, and other factors that can help predict and\
    \ manage the impact of a ﬂood.\nBy using edge and fog computing, this data can\
    \ be analyzed in real-time, allowing for EWS\nto be put in place and emergency\
    \ responders to be deployed more quickly [80]. Similarly,\nsensors can be used\
    \ to detect seismic activity and predict earthquakes, with data processed\nlocally\
    \ to provide early warning and minimize damage.\nOverall, fog and edge computing\
    \ play an important role in natural disaster detection\nand management by enabling\
    \ real-time data processing and analysis at the edge of the\nnetwork [81]. This\
    \ approach can help improve the speed and accuracy of disaster response,\nultimately\
    \ leading to better outcomes for affected communities.\nVeriﬁcation and validation\
    \ (V&V) techniques are crucial for ensuring the quality, relia-\nbility, and security\
    \ of software systems in the context of IoT and cloud computing [82,83].\nThese\
    \ systems involve a complex network of devices, sensors, and services that must\
    \ work\ntogether seamlessly and securely [84]. V&V techniques provide a framework\
    \ for testing and\nvalidating these systems, ensuring that they meet the speciﬁed\
    \ requirements and perform\nas intended. By implementing V&V techniques, developers\
    \ can identify and correct defects\nand errors before they cause signiﬁcant problems,\
    \ ultimately leading to higher quality and\nmore reliable IoT and cloud systems\
    \ [85].\nIn [86], the authors reviewed geospatial and remote sensing technologies\
    \ in earthquake\nresearch and disaster management, analyzing their historical\
    \ and future applications, limi-\ntations, and methodologies. It provides a framework\
    \ for earthquake hazard, vulnerability,\nand risk analysis using geospatial technologies.\
    \ In [87], the study examined remote sensing\napplications, including Landsat\
    \ satellite imaging, LiDAR, optical satellite photography,\nInSAR, and DEMETER\
    \ in earthquake research. Many other studies [88–90] explore the\nrole of IoT\
    \ in disaster management and compares IoT-based options for various calamities.\n\
    It highlights IoT EWS for ﬁres and earthquakes and advises stakeholders on leveraging\n\
    IoT technology to secure smart cities’ infrastructure and minimize risks. The\
    \ studies also\nevaluate Caribbean DRM (Disaster and Risk Management) systems,\
    \ emphasizing the need\nfor technology and new methods in monitoring disaster\
    \ risks in small island states. It\nassesses technology in the ﬁve DRM pillars\
    \ and proposes improvements for technology\nadoption in the Caribbean subregion.\
    \ The research contributes to the global discussion on\ntechnology and innovation\
    \ in DRM and addresses sustainable development concerns in\nCaribbean SIDS (Small\
    \ Islands Developing States).\nThe review paper [91] explores building damage\
    \ mapping techniques in post-earthquake\nscenarios, emphasizing machine learning\
    \ (ML) and deep learning frameworks. It addresses\nthe drawbacks of manual interpretation\
    \ of remote sensing imagery and identifies research\ngaps. The study of [92] reviews\
    \ remote sensing methods for earthquake risk assessment,\nhighlighting the importance\
    \ of vulnerability assessment and the need for a comprehensive\napproach. In [93],\
    \ satellite remote sensing technology for EEWS is suggested to achieve more\n\
    improvements for EWS. The research of [94] examines post-earthquake damage investiga-\n\
    tion using optical remote sensing data and change detection algorithms, discussing\
    \ their\nchallenges and potential. The authors in [95] analyze how emerging technologies\
    \ improve\ndisaster management processes and call for further investigation. Lastly,\
    \ the work done in [96]\npresents a procedure for managing pre- and post-earthquake\
    \ stages of structure management\nusing digital tools and emphasizes the role\
    \ of BIM models and IDM standards.\nCompared to previous works, our paper presents\

    Seismic activity is a key subject of investigation. Understanding how different\
    \ types\nof structures respond to earthquake loads and ﬁnding out how to safeguard\
    \ occupants of a\nstructure in an earthquake are both aided by this knowledge.\n\
    The study of seismicity can help us better understand the many seismic wave types\n\
    that are generated, allowing us to map both the regions that are earthquake-prone\
    \ and\nthose that are not. Studying a region’s seismic activity aids in establishing\
    \ minimum safety\nrequirements for that area, making it simpler for life to go\
    \ on after an earthquake [97,98].\nAcoustic energy, known as a seismic wave, can\
    \ move through the Earth or another\nplanetary body. It could be caused by a quake\
    \ (or an earthquake more generally), a volcanic\neruption, the movement of magma,\
    \ a big landslide, or a sizable explosion brought on by\nhuman activity, such\
    \ as mining, which releases low-frequency acoustic energy. Seismolo-\ngists are\
    \ responsible for investigating seismic waves. To record the waves, seismologists\n\
    use accelerometers, hydrophones, or seismometers that are submerged in water [99].\
    \ It\nis important to differentiate seismic waves from seismic noise, also known\
    \ as ambient\nvibration, which is characterized by a continuous low-amplitude\
    \ vibration and can be\ncaused by a wide variety of natural and artiﬁcial sources.\
    \ Arrays of sensors are typically\nused in seismic signal processing, which is\
    \ followed by signal conditioning and data fusion.\nAn ADC converter is then used\
    \ to digitize the gathered data, and a microcontroller is used\nto process it.\
    \ This is referred to as an IoT node in the context of the IoT, and it is shown\
    \ in\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. IoT sensor node for EEWS.\nIt is possible to differentiate\
    \ between the two types of seismic waves known as body\nwaves, which move through\
    \ the inside of the planet, and surface waves, which move along\nthe surface of\
    \ the planet. Body waves ﬂow through the interior of the Earth in a manner\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n8 of 38\nthat is determined by the paths that are created by\
    \ material properties such as density and\nmodulus (stiffness). Temperature, chemical\
    \ composition, and the state of the material all\nhave an effect on the material’s\
    \ modulus and density. This phenomenon can be compared\nto the refraction of light\
    \ waves. On the basis of how particles move, body waves can be\ndivided into two\
    \ distinct categories: primary and secondary waves. Around the year 1830,\nthe\
    \ French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson identiﬁed this distinction as follows\
    \ [100]:\n•\nPrimary waves, also referred to as P-waves, are longitudinal compressional\
    \ waves that\nmove through the earth in a straight line. These waves are known\
    \ as “primary” waves\nbecause they arrive ﬁrst at seismograph stations, traveling\
    \ faster through the earth\nthan other types of waves. P-waves are pressure waves\
    \ that can travel through any\nmaterial, including ﬂuids, and move at a speed\
    \ that is around 1.7 times faster than that\nof S-waves. In contrast to S-waves,\
    \ which are transverse waves that move side-to-side,\nP-waves are compression\
    \ waves that cause particles in the material they are traveling\nthrough to move\
    \ back and forth in the direction of the wave’s propagation. They take\nthe form\
    \ of sound waves in the air and move at the same velocity as sound waves,\nwhich\
    \ is around 330 m per second on average. The ability of P-waves to travel through\n\
    any material allows them to be used to study the interior of the earth. By measuring\n\
    the time taken for P-waves to travel through the earth from an earthquake’s epicenter\n\
    to a seismograph station, scientists can calculate information about the earth’s\
    \ internal\nstructure. For example, the average speed of P-waves in granite is\
    \ roughly 5000 m per\nsecond, while in water, it is around 1450 m per second.\
    \ This information can be used\nto create a detailed model of the Earth’s interior.\n\
    •\nS-waves, also known as secondary shear waves, are transverse waves that cause\
    \ the\nground to shift in a direction perpendicular to their propagation during\
    \ an earthquake.\nThese waves arrive at seismograph stations after P-waves, which\
    \ are faster. S-waves\nhave a horizontal polarization and move in a horizontal\
    \ direction, causing the ground\nto shift from side to side. However, S-waves\
    \ can only travel through solids since\nliquids and gases do not support shear\
    \ forces. They move through any solid medium\nat a speed that is approximately\
    \ 60% slower than P-waves. The absence of S-waves in\nthe outer core of the Earth\
    \ is consistent with the presence of liquid. This is because\nS-waves cannot propagate\
    \ through liquids, and their absence indicates that the outer\ncore is predominantly\
    \ liquid. However, P-waves can propagate through liquids,\nwhich is why they can\
    \ travel through the entire Earth. The study of seismic waves\nand their behavior\
    \ has provided scientists with valuable insights into the structure\nand composition\
    \ of the Earth’s interior.\nThe path that seismic surface waves take along the\
    \ surface of the Earth [101]. These\nare an example of a type of surface wave\
    \ known as mechanical surface waves. They are\nreferred to as surface waves because\
    \ their strength decreases as they go away from the\nocean’s surface. They move\
    \ at a much slower pace compared to seismic body waves (P\nand S). The amplitude\
    \ of surface waves can reach several millimeters during particularly\npowerful\
    \ earthquakes.\nSeismographs that are situated at a greater distance from the\
    \ epicenter of an earthquake\nare unable to detect the high frequencies of the\
    \ ﬁrst P wave. In contrast, seismographs\nthat are situated closer to the epicenter\
    \ are able to record both the P and S waves that are\ngenerated when an earthquake\
    \ takes place [102].\nThe problems that are associated with seismic data are probably\
    \ unmatched by any\nothers. During the course of the past few decades, the amounts\
    \ of such data have nearly\nmultiplied exponentially [103]. In recent acquisition\
    \ studies, petabits of data are being pro-\ncessed on a daily basis. This requires\
    \ massive processing capabilities. It should, therefore,\nnot come as a surprise\
    \ that data formats have evolved signiﬁcantly over the years and\nthat they have\
    \ been altered to meet particular workﬂows or software solutions, which has\n\
    added to the complexity of managing data [104].\nIn recent years, the industry\
    \ of exploration and production has been dealing with “big\ndata” in the form\
    \ of seismic data [105]. This data is collected during seismic surveys. As\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n9 of 38\nmore and more varieties of data are gathered and reprocessed\
    \ for a variety of purposes, the\namount and volume of data continue to grow at\
    \ an alarming rate. It is necessary to locate\nand manage both ﬁeld and prestack\
    \ data because new insights can be derived from old data\nby applying updated\
    \ seismic processing methods. Because of this, it is important to keep\ntrack\
    \ of both sets of data. Several companies made the decision to store this information\
    \ on\ntapes because of the massive size of seismic data ﬁles and the prohibitively\
    \ expensive cost\nof disk space. However, tapes were difﬁcult to handle and regularly\
    \ went missing, so this\nwas not an ideal solution. Web-based viewers and administration\
    \ tools make it easier to\ndiscover and handle data from anywhere in the world.\
    \ At the same time, tiered storage\nand cloud storage offer new and more cost-effective\
    \ means of keeping enormous seismic\ndatasets [106]. Figure 3 shows the enhancements\
    \ of the utilized earthquake measurement.\nFigure 3. Earthquake measurement evolution.\n\
    Seismic wave analysis is a key component of earthquake early warning systems,\
    \ as\nit enables the detection and characterization of seismic waves in real-time\
    \ [107,108]. One\nof the most widely used signal processing techniques in seismic\
    \ wave analysis is the\nFourier transform, which is used to transform time-domain\
    \ signals into frequency-domain\nsignals [109,110]. In earthquake early warning\
    \ systems, the Fourier transform is often used\nto analyze the spectral content\
    \ of seismic waves, which can provide important information\nabout the location,\
    \ magnitude, and duration of an earthquake [111]. The Fourier transform\nis also\
    \ used to ﬁlter out noise and unwanted signals from seismic data, improving the\n\
    accuracy of earthquake detection and analysis [112].\nAnother advanced signal\
    \ processing technique used in seismic wave analysis is\nwavelet analysis, which\
    \ is used to analyze signals that are both time-varying and non-\nstationary [113–115].\
    \ In earthquake early warning systems, wavelet analysis is often used\nto detect\
    \ and analyze seismic waves that have complex frequency components, such as\n\
    those generated by slow earthquakes or volcanic activity [116,117]. By decomposing\
    \ a\nseismic waveform into its constituent frequency components, wavelet analysis\
    \ can provide\nmore detailed information on the characteristics of seismic waves,\
    \ such as their frequency\ncontent, duration, and amplitude [118,119].\nIn addition\
    \ to these advanced signal processing techniques, earthquake early warning\nsystems\
    \ also rely on a variety of speciﬁc parameters to optimize their performance [120,121].\n\
    These parameters include sampling rates, window sizes, and ﬁlter cutoff frequencies,\n\
    among others. Sampling rates determine how often seismic data is collected and\
    \ stored,\nwhile window sizes determine the length of time over which seismic\
    \ data is analyzed.\nFilter cutoff frequencies determine which frequency components\
    \ of a seismic waveform are\nanalyzed and are often used to remove noise and unwanted\
    \ signals from seismic data.\nIn conclusion, earthquake early warning systems\
    \ rely on a variety of advanced signal\nprocessing techniques and speciﬁc parameters\
    \ to detect and analyze seismic waves in\nreal time. By providing more detailed\
    \ information on these techniques and parameters,\nwe aim to enhance the technical\
    \ rigor of our paper and improve the understanding of\nthe underlying technology.\
    \ By optimizing the performance of earthquake early warning\nSustainability 2023,\
    \ 15, 11713\n10 of 38\nsystems through advanced signal processing techniques and\
    \ speciﬁc parameters, we can\nimprove the accuracy and effectiveness of these\
    \ systems, ultimately helping to save lives\nand reduce the impact of earthquakes\
    \ on communities.\n3. IoT-Cloud Systems\n3.1. IoT Systems\nThe IoT is gaining\
    \ increasing support as a viable new technology throughout the\nworld [122,123].\
    \ An IoT is a system that relies on connected embedded items or gadgets\nthat\
    \ have identiﬁers and are able to interact with one another without the assistance\n\
    of humans using a common communication protocol. It has been reported that there\n\
    are more internet-connected devices on the earth than there are humans, where\
    \ these\ndevices support the smart cities establishment [124–126]. Some smart\
    \ cities are already in\nexistence [127]. The growth of intelligent technology\
    \ is outlined on Statista’s website [128]\nunder Figure 4. As has been suggested,\
    \ an enormous increase in smart homes as well\nas commercial buildings, and important\
    \ requirements for these buildings will include\nintelligent electricity and water\
    \ management [129]. Statista projects that the number of IoT\ndevices will nearly\
    \ triple between 2020 and 2030, going from 9.7 billion in 2020 to more\nthan 29\
    \ billion in 2030. Over 5 billion consumer IoT devices are expected to exist in\
    \ China\nby 2030. Accordingly, it is the nation with the majority of these devices.\
    \ Consumer markets\nmake use of IoT devices; nevertheless, it is anticipated that\
    \ the consumer market will\naccount for more than 60 percent of all IoT-connected\
    \ devices by the year 2020 [128]. For\nthe next decade, it is anticipated that\
    \ this proportion will not change from its current value.\nϬ\nϱ\nϭϬ\nϭϱ\nϮϬ\n\

    dƌĞŶĚ\nFigure 4. Estimated growth of IoT nodes.\nAccording to [130–134], several\
    \ industry verticals now have more than 100 million\nconnected IoT devices, including\
    \ government, retail and wholesale, transportation and\nstorage, electricity,\
    \ steam, gas, air conditioning, waste management, water supply, and\nretail and\
    \ wholesale. It is predicted that by 2030, over 8,000,000 IoT nodes will be employed\n\
    in all industries [128]. In addition, cell phones can represent the best contributor\
    \ to IoT\nnodes. Interestingly, it is expected to reach nearly 17 billion by 2030,\
    \ and more than one\nbillion would be used to connected (autonomous) vehicles\
    \ [128], information technology\ninfrastructure, asset tracking and monitoring,\
    \ and smart grids [135–137].\nWhile conﬁguring an IoT system, the following steps\
    \ should be carried out in accor-\ndance with established industry standards [138–143]:\n\
    •\nProviding the node with an interface that can collect data from the environment.\n\
    •\nProviding a tool for acquiring and analyzing data in order to derive knowledge\
    \ from it.\n•\nTaking action and communicating choices and information to the\
    \ appropriate hubs.\nTo gain a comprehensive understanding of an IoT solution’s\
    \ architecture, it is neces-\nsary to examine multiple IoT systems. As shown in\
    \ Figure 5, an IoT system’s framework\ntypically consists of a sensor network\
    \ that monitors changes in the surrounding environ-\nment. Depending on the required\
    \ transmission speed and distance, the collected stream\nshould be transmitted\
    \ to a centralized or decentralized administration using, e.g., Zig-\nbee, Bluetooth,\
    \ Tmote Sky, 4G, etc. It is important to note that the sensor system needs\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n11 of 38\na continuous source of electricity, and the choice\
    \ of connectivity is inﬂuenced by power\nconsumption, with mobile service requiring\
    \ more power than WiFi, 474.67 to 576.64 mW\nand 1254.3 to 1540.6 mW, respectively\
    \ [144]. Safety considerations for both hardware and\nconnectivity are also crucial.\
    \ An IoT system’s data is reviewed or saved in the cloud system\nto identify patterns\
    \ and extrapolate information, a critical requirement for any IoT system.\nThe\
    \ data can be simpliﬁed using data visualization, and alert systems can be implemented\n\
    to provide appropriate levels of caution to users. It is essential that IoT system\
    \ design is\nnot limited to industry professionals only.\nFigure 5. A general\
    \ IoT system paradigm.\nThe IoT has the potential to revolutionize methods of\
    \ detecting and managing disasters.\nWith the help of IoT devices, we can collect\
    \ real-time data on various environmental factors\nsuch as temperature, humidity,\
    \ air pressure, and wind speed, which can help us detect\nnatural disasters such\
    \ as hurricanes, ﬂoods, and earthquakes. These devices can also\nmonitor infrastructure\
    \ such as bridges, dams, and buildings for any signs of damage or\nweakness and\
    \ alert authorities before they collapse or fail, preventing further damage and\n\
    loss of life.\nMoreover, IoT can aid disaster management by providing real-time\
    \ updates on the\naffected areas, helping authorities plan and allocate resources\
    \ effectively. Smart sensors and\ncameras can be deployed to assess the extent\
    \ of the damage in disaster-stricken areas, and\ndrones can be used to reach inaccessible\
    \ areas and gather more information. This data can\nbe analyzed using ML algorithms\
    \ to identify patterns and predict future disasters [145,146],\nimproving the\
    \ accuracy of EWS and minimizing the impact of disasters.\nAnother signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of IoT in disaster management is its ability to facilitate\ncommunication\
    \ between emergency responders and victims. Wearable devices and mobile\napps\
    \ can help victims send alerts and SOS messages, and responders can use IoT devices\n\
    to locate and rescue survivors in real time. IoT can also help in tracking the\
    \ movements of\nrescue teams and ensuring their safety.\nThe use of IoT for disaster\
    \ detection and management has the potential to save\ncountless lives and minimize\
    \ the impact of disasters. By leveraging IoT devices to collect\nreal-time data,\
    \ authorities can detect disasters early, manage resources effectively, and\n\
    respond quickly to save lives. However, it is crucial to address concerns about\
    \ data privacy\nand security to ensure the safe and ethical use of IoT in disaster\
    \ management.\nDrones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have come\
    \ a long way\nsince their inception in the early 20th century [147]. Initially\
    \ used for military purposes,\ndrones have evolved and diversiﬁed over time, and\
    \ today they have a wide range of\napplications in various ﬁelds, including photography,\
    \ agriculture, search and rescue, and\ndisaster management [148]. In addition,\
    \ it can be equipped with thermal imaging sensors\nthat can also be used to detect\
    \ the presence of survivors in collapsed buildings or other\nhard-to-reach areas\
    \ [149].\nThere are several types of drones (Figure 6), each with unique characteristics\
    \ and\ncapabilities. The most common types of drones are ﬁxed-wing, rotary-wing,\
    \ and hybrid\ndrones. Fixed-wing drones are similar to airplanes and can ﬂy for\
    \ longer distances, while\nrotary-wing drones, also known as quadcopters, are\
    \ more agile and can hover in place.\nHybrid drones combine features of both ﬁxed-wing\
    \ and rotary-wing drones, providing a\nbalance between endurance and agility.\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n12 of 38\nFigure 6. Different types of UAVs.\n\
    Drones can be involved in various types of communications (Figure 7), including\n\
    visual, auditory, and data communication. Visual communication involves transmitting\n\
    images and videos captured by the drone’s camera to a remote operator or a ground\
    \ station.\nAuditory communication can include transmitting audio messages, such\
    \ as warnings or\ninstructions, to individuals or groups on the ground via a speaker\
    \ on the drone. Data\ncommunication involves transmitting data, such as telemetry\
    \ and sensor readings, between\nthe drone and a ground station or another device.\
    \ Additionally, drones can be equipped\nwith communication technologies such as\
    \ satellite communication, Wi-Fi, and cellular\nnetworks to enable long-range\
    \ communication and control. In [150], the authors exploited\nthe UAVs to collect\
    \ data for disaster management relying on 5G (ﬁfth generation) and B5G\n(beyond\
    \ 5G) systems with their huge capacity in terms of different data types. The authors\n\
    investigated various literature solutions to some UAV issues, such as energy harvesting\n\
    and security. For example, they mentioned a sample method that used UAVs to ﬁnd\
    \ the\nmost suitable localization of the sensor nodes for optimizing Quality of\
    \ Service.\nFigure 7. Possible types of communications between UAVs and end-users.\n\
    In recent years, advances in technology have enabled the integration of new sensing\n\
    and data collection methods into EEWS systems, including the use of drones [151,152].\n\
    Drone-based sensing can provide high-resolution data on earthquake characteristics,\
    \ such\nas ground motion and deformation, which can improve the accuracy and effectiveness\n\
    of EEWS systems [153,154]. The main advantages and limitations of the use of drones\
    \ is\nsummarized in Table 2.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n13 of 38\nTable\

    \ IoT and cloud infrastructure can provide\nscalability, fault-tolerance, and\
    \ data processing capabilities [156]. IoT devices, such as\naccelerometers and\
    \ GPS sensors, can provide additional data sources for earthquake moni-\ntoring\
    \ and analysis. In contrast, cloud infrastructure can provide storage and processing\n\
    capabilities for large-scale data analysis and modeling [157]. Coordination between\
    \ these\nvarious technical aspects is essential for the successful deployment\
    \ and operation of EEWS\nsystems, and careful consideration of their capabilities,\
    \ limitations, and interdependencies\nis necessary to ensure their effectiveness\
    \ in mitigating the impact of earthquakes [158].\n3.2. Cloud and Fog Systems\n\
    Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing resources, such as servers,\n\
    storage, databases, and software, over the internet on an on-demand basis [159].\
    \ It provides\nusers with easy access to a wide range of computing resources that\
    \ can be scaled up or\ndown based on demand without requiring users to invest\
    \ in and maintain their own\nphysical infrastructure. Fog computing, on the other\
    \ hand, is a distributed computing\nmodel that brings computing resources closer\
    \ to the edge of the network, closer to where\ndata is generated and consumed,\
    \ and provides real-time processing and decision-making\ncapabilities [160].\n\
    The importance of cloud and fog computing in natural disaster detection and man-\n\
    agement cannot be overstated. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes,\
    \ ﬂoods,\nand wildﬁres can cause widespread devastation and loss of life. The\
    \ use of cloud and fog\ncomputing in disaster management can help to mitigate\
    \ the effects of these disasters by\nproviding real-time data analysis, decision-making,\
    \ and communication capabilities [161].\nCloud computing can be used to store\
    \ and process large amounts of data generated\nby sensors and other devices used\
    \ in disaster management. This data can be analyzed in\nreal-time, providing EWS\
    \ to alert authorities and the public of impending disasters. Cloud\ncomputing\
    \ can also be used to store and share critical data such as emergency response\n\
    plans, evacuation routes, and contact information for emergency services.\nFog\
    \ computing can be used to process and analyze data at the edge of the network,\n\
    near the source of the data. This can provide real-time information about the\
    \ status of\ninfrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings, allowing authorities\
    \ to make informed\ndecisions about evacuation and emergency response efforts.\
    \ Fog computing can also be\nused to provide real-time communication capabilities,\
    \ allowing emergency services to\ncoordinate their efforts and communicate with\
    \ each other and the public in real time.\nIn summary, cloud and fog computing\
    \ play a critical role in natural disaster detection\nand management. They provide\
    \ real-time data analysis, decision-making, and commu-\nSustainability 2023, 15,\
    \ 11713\n14 of 38\nnication capabilities, allowing authorities to respond quickly\
    \ and effectively to disasters,\npotentially saving countless lives and minimizing\
    \ the damage caused by these events.\n4. IoT-Cloud-Based EEWS\nThis section will\
    \ highlight the signiﬁcant signiﬁcance that the IoT-Cloud technology\nplays in\
    \ EEWS. In point of fact, the application of IoT-Cloud strategies has been of\
    \ assistance\nto EEWS before and after disasters.\nThe IoT has revolutionized\
    \ the way we interact with the physical world, and one of its\nmost promising\
    \ applications is in the detection and prediction of natural disasters such\n\
    as earthquakes. The basic idea behind using IoT for earthquake detection is to\
    \ deploy a\nnetwork of sensors that can detect seismic activity and transmit the\
    \ data to a central server\nfor analysis. These sensors can be embedded in buildings,\
    \ bridges, and other structures, as\nwell as in the ground itself. By analyzing\
    \ the data from these sensors, it is possible to detect\nthe onset of an earthquake\
    \ and predict its magnitude and location.\nOne of the key advantages of using\
    \ IoT for earthquake detection is that it allows for\nreal-time monitoring of\
    \ seismic activity. Traditional methods of earthquake detection rely\non seismometers,\
    \ which are expensive and require a lot of maintenance. They also typically\n\
    only provide data after an earthquake has already occurred. In contrast, IoT sensors\
    \ can\nprovide continuous data in real-time, allowing for EWS to be put in place\
    \ [162–164]. This\ncan be particularly useful in areas prone to earthquakes, where\
    \ early warning can save\nlives and reduce damage.\nAnother advantage of using\
    \ IoT for earthquake detection is that it can provide more\ndenser data network\
    \ than traditional methods. IoT sensors can be placed in a wider variety\nof locations,\
    \ such as inside buildings or underground, allowing for a more comprehensive\n\
    picture of seismic activity. They can also provide data on other factors that\
    \ can affect the\nimpact of an earthquake, such as soil conditions and building\
    \ materials. This information\ncan be used to develop better models for earthquake\
    \ prediction and to design buildings\nand infrastructure that are more resistant\
    \ to seismic activity.\nThe use of IoT for earthquake detection has the potential\
    \ to revolutionize the way\nwe prepare for and respond to earthquakes. By providing\
    \ real-time data and more com-\nprehensive information on seismic activity, IoT\
    \ sensors can improve our ability to predict\nearthquakes and minimize their impact.\
    \ As the technology continues to develop, we can\nexpect to see more widespread\
    \ deployment of IoT sensors and more sophisticated analysis\ntechniques, leading\
    \ to even better earthquake detection and prediction capabilities.\nA generic\
    \ EEWS architecture typically consists of three main components: the seismic\n\
    network, the processing center, and the alert distribution system [165]. The seismic\
    \ network\ncomprises a set of sensors deployed across a region of interest, which\
    \ detect and record\nseismic waves generated by earthquakes. The sensor data is\
    \ transmitted to the processing\ncenter, where it is analyzed in real-time using\
    \ algorithms and models to estimate the loca-\ntion, magnitude, and other characteristics\
    \ of the earthquake [166]. The alert distribution\nsystem then disseminates the\
    \ earthquake alert to end-users through various channels, such\nas mobile devices,\
    \ sirens, and public announcements [167]. The underlying infrastructure\nof the\
    \ EEWS includes a variety of hardware and software components, including seismome-\n\
    ters, communication networks, computing systems, and databases [168]. The seismometers\n\
    are typically deployed in a dense network to ensure high spatial resolution and\
    \ coverage,\nand they are connected to a communication network that transmits\
    \ the sensor data to the\nprocessing center [169]. The processing center comprises\
    \ a set of computing systems that\nperform real-time data analysis, using a variety\
    \ of algorithms and models to estimate the\nearthquake parameters [170]. The alert\
    \ distribution system includes a set of communica-\ntion channels and protocols\
    \ that disseminate the alert to end-users, as well as a database\nthat stores\
    \ historical and real-time earthquake data [171]. The interactions between these\n\
    components are tightly coordinated to ensure timely and accurate earthquake alerts,\
    \ which\ncan help to mitigate the impact of earthquakes and save lives [172].\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n15 of 38\nIn [173], the authors developed CrowdQuake,\
    \ a DL-based seismic detection system.\nUtilizing a dense IoT network composed\
    \ of MEMS nodes, the system employs a multi-\nhead convolution neural network\
    \ to analyze a large quantity of observed acceleration\ndata. During the model\
    \ validation procedure, the scientists got data from the National\nResearch Institute\
    \ for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) and measured the\nprecision-recall,\
    \ accuracy, and noise level. The developed system could process data from\nup\
    \ to 8000 IoT sensors, and identifying an earthquake required only a few seconds\
    \ of\nprocessing time, according to the researchers. In [174], an advanced EEWS\
    \ supported by an\nIoT network that operates on the basis of real-time alerts\
    \ has been established. The network\nutilized MEMS accelerometers and an Arduino\
    \ Cortex M4 CPU for measuring acceleration.\nThis technique employs ML to improve\
    \ the accuracy and latency in earthquake detection.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ using data gathered locally by the MEMS accelerometer nodes\nthat were installed.\n\
    In [175], IoT acceleration nodes were designed explicitly for earthquake detection.\n\
    Two methods are used to utilize these nodes: a technique of standalone and a technique\
    \ of\nclient-server. The ﬁrst technique is more commonly used, while the client-server\
    \ technique\nis more precise but requires high-performance servers and network\
    \ infrastructure to man-\nage data acceleration from multiple client machines.\
    \ Basic earthquake detection methods\ncan be independently explored on less capable\
    \ mobile nodes. However, this may result in\nfalse alarms. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ a cooperative method that uses a large number of\nmobile phones located in close\
    \ proximity to one another is employed. This creates a seismic\nnetwork that can\
    \ detect earthquakes and monitors any shaking caused by human activity,\nmechanical\
    \ vibrations, earthquakes, etc. By relying on a primary neural network, a motion\n\
    similar to an earthquake detected by a smartphone is transmitted to other cellphones\
    \ in\nthe immediate area using a multi-hop mode. Furthermore, every mobile phone\
    \ in the\nnetwork determines and notiﬁes the network of an earthquake, then triggers\
    \ an alarm after\nobtaining detection data from other smartphones in its immediate\
    \ vicinity. This technique\nimproves the earthquake detection capabilities of\
    \ a standalone method that does not use\nany system or network infrastructures.\n\
    In [176], a predictive model that combines IoT devices and ML techniques was used\
    \ to\ndetect geological landslide occurrences. The predictive model was trained\
    \ with geotechnical\nparameters such as soil shear strength, soil moisture, rain\
    \ intensity, terrain slope, and more.\nThe actual hardware used for this purpose\
    \ consisted of a collection of sensors that gathered\nreal-time information on\
    \ the topography and soil. In [177], the authors proposed a compute\nofﬂoading\
    \ system architecture that can be implemented on Internet-connected drones. They\n\
    conducted an in-depth experimental study to compare the efﬁciency of cloud computing\n\
    ofﬂoading strategy with that of the edge computing strategy for DL solutions in\
    \ the context\nof unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The authors investigated the\
    \ balance between the\ncomputational cost of the two alternative options communications\
    \ in an experiment.\nIn [53], a DL paradigm based on integrating autoencoder (AE)\
    \ and CNN was devel-\noped to immediately determine earthquake magnitude and position\
    \ three seconds after\nthe P-wave begins. The authors referred to it as CNN and\
    \ 3s AE (3S-AE-CNN). The\ndata set used in the study was monitored by three stations\
    \ of the Hi-net seismic network\nin Japan, and the approach was evaluated using\
    \ data from 12,200 separate occurrences\n(109.80 thousand 3 s three-component\
    \ seismic windows). The model simpliﬁes the ex-\ntraction of essential waveform\
    \ properties, resulting in a higher degree of credibility in\nearthquake parameter\
    \ assessment. The suggested model predicts magnitude, latitude,\nand longitude\
    \ with an accuracy of within 28 × 10−6, 3.3 × 10−6, and 100 × 10−6 degrees,\n\
    respectively. That model immediately communicates event features to a sink IoT\
    \ node. It\nprovides guidance to the relevant administration on how to proceed.\
    \ It is noted that AE\nhas proved beneﬁcial in feature extraction regardless of\
    \ the application [178].\nThe framework for earthquake prediction proposed in\
    \ [179] is a novel approach based\non federated learning (FL). This FL framework\
    \ outperformed the previously developed\nML model for earthquake estimation through\
    \ an IoT gateway in terms of reliability and\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n\
    16 of 38\naccuracy. The model achieved an accuracy of 88% by analyzing multidimensional\
    \ data over\na 100 km radial area, excluding the Western Himalayas, and studying\
    \ the data. In [180], an\nEEW based on an IoT and an ML model was suggested to\
    \ predict tsunamis using tsunami\ndata dating back to 2100 BC and was trained\
    \ on earthquake parameters in the dataset. It\nachieved an accuracy of 95% in\
    \ predicting earthquake location, depth, and magnitude.\nIn [181], a DL approach\
    \ that can identify P-waves despite background noise was\ndeveloped using MEMS\
    \ for observing events. The model can detect the probability of\noccurring preceding\
    \ signiﬁcant shocks and accurately predict P-waves between 1.5 and\n2.5 s before\
    \ their arrival. In [182], the authors used detector nodes to detect earthquakes\n\
    locally by probing the environment and assessing data from probes in the surrounding\n\
    area. The method stores all data locally, making it resistant to node failures\
    \ and partial\nnetwork outages, thus increasing privacy. The test network consisted\
    \ of twenty node codes\njoined with ten neighbor nodes chosen at random. The total\
    \ number of detectors was\nsampled every ten seconds. In [183], a Multilayer Perceptron-classiﬁer\
    \ was developed\nto provide a severity-based warning by predicting the possibility\
    \ of an onsite intensity\nexceeding a pre-trained PGA threshold associated with\
    \ damaging intensities on the MMI\nscale—seismic properties observed by the strong-motion\
    \ signal starting from the P-wave in\nthe developed model. The authors of [184]\
    \ proposed an independent model of earthquake\ndetection via low-cost acceleration\
    \ nodes. The model utilized four different sensor types\nfor establishing an EEWS\
    \ with different types of data, e.g., noise from buildings, vibrations,\nand earthquake\
    \ records. To test the sensors, two actual earthquakes were replicated on a\n\
    shake table. The study found that low-cost acceleration sensors can detect earthquakes\
    \ by\nmonitoring differences in acceleration induced by a range between 0.02 g\
    \ to 0.8 g, which\ncan be detected by the sensors. Therefore, the authors used\
    \ scaled data within that range.\nAn ML methodology with earthquake characteristics\
    \ was utilized, as opposed to the\nmore conventional seismic methodologies that\
    \ are typically used [185–187]. The authors\nbroke the detection problem down\
    \ into two distinct groups, namely, static settings and\ndynamic settings. They\
    \ provide the most effective ML approach and input data for the static\nenvironment\
    \ based on an experimental evaluation of numerous features for circumventing\n\
    the issue of discriminating earthquake and noise components to reduce the number\
    \ of false\nalarms. This model was validated with the help of 385 earthquakes\
    \ ranging in magnitude\nfrom 4.0 to 8.0.\nThe authors of the paper [188] introduced\
    \ the Distributed Multi-Sensor Earthquake\nEarly Warning (DMSEEW) system as a\
    \ cutting-edge ML-based technique that includes\ndata from GPS stations and earthquake\
    \ sensors in order to recognize large and medium\nearthquakes. The model relies\
    \ on an innovative stacking ensemble technique that has\nbeen validated by geoscientists\
    \ using a real-world dataset. This approach was used to\nbuild DMSEEW. The architecture\
    \ of the system was designed to be regionally spread,\nwhich allows for both brisk\
    \ processing and resistance to disruptions in some aspects of\nthe underlying\
    \ infrastructure. To be more speciﬁc, these systems combined GPS and\nseismic\
    \ data in order to enhance earthquake detection, which led to the creation of\
    \ an\nefﬁcient EEWS.\nKaracı [189] used vibration sensors for earthquake detection\
    \ according to some thresh-\nold values. If an earthquake has been detected via\
    \ the vibration sensors, a warning system\ntakes place. In this warning system,\
    \ there is a Wi-Fi module for Internet connection to send\na tweet by means of\
    \ the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform service. There is also a sound\nalarm\
    \ via a buzzer for the people staying around the earthquake area. Thus, the electronic\n\
    part of this study covers an Arduino card, Wi-Fi module, Inertial Measurement\
    \ Unit sensor,\nvibration sensor card, and buzzer. The software part involves\
    \ the codes of Processing with\nArduino to obtain the sensor data normalization\
    \ and the difference between sequential\nsensor values for monitoring the threshold\
    \ level.\nBabu and Rajan [190] have studied an IoT solution that alerts for a\
    \ ﬂood or earthquake\ndetection before they happen and living beings being searched\
    \ for during the disasters.\nSensors are connected to a microcontroller, RF transmitter,\
    \ and receiver. Their values are\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n17 of 38\nanalyzed\
    \ in real-time via ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform service [190]. The authorities\n\
    are notiﬁed by GSM messages during a ﬂood or earthquake disaster using the IP\
    \ protocol.\nA water level sensor has been used for ﬂood detection, and four color\
    \ bulbs represent the\ndanger levels. A rain sensor has worked to determine whether\
    \ there is rain. Additionally, a\nvibration sensor has been used for an earthquake.\
    \ The system and the mobile phones are\ncharged with solar energy as a secure\
    \ option for ﬂood environments. ESP Wi-Fi module\nis the gateway as the fundamental\
    \ processing and storage part between the RF receiver-\ntransmitter-bulb system\
    \ and ThingSpeak cloud server for sensor data transmission. This\ndata can be\
    \ followed using a ThingSpeak API that is used for mobile phones, laptops, or\n\
    any other internet-connected device. Wireless communication, especially GPS, is\
    \ used for\nliving being searches.\nWon et al. [191] proposed a high-ﬁdelity vibration\
    \ sensor consisting of a MEMS\naccelerometer with high sampling frequency and\
    \ digital ﬁltering. During the sensing\nprocess, Short-Term Average/Long-Term\
    \ Average trigger is compared with a threshold\nvalue. Over the threshold, data\
    \ acquisition, low-pass ﬁltering, and downsampling to\na frequency are performed.\
    \ After this procedure, if an earthquake is detected with the\nproposed algorithm,\
    \ the system notiﬁes it through a Bluetooth Beacon. The authors\nmentioned that\
    \ the hardware platform was Adafruit nRF52840 Feather Express developed\nbased\
    \ on nRF52840 (Nordic, 2019) board having fast computing and high storage attributes\n\
    provided by CPU, RAM, and ﬂash parts. Additionally, the nRF52840 module has Bluetooth\n\
    5 and Arduino IDE support.\nDuggal et al. [192] mentioned that the literature\
    \ studies could not separate any other\nvibrational noise properly from that of\
    \ earthquakes. They proposed a new method by using\nIoT to eliminate this drawback.\
    \ A Micro Electro-mechanical system sensor is set inside a\nbuilding after ﬁnding\
    \ the most suitable place via structural analysis with the information\non seismic\
    \ shear walls. Inside this sensor, there is an accelerometer and a gyroscope.\
    \ The\ngyroscope saves the ground’s shaking pattern, representing a distinctive\
    \ nature during an\nearthquake. IoT I2C Communication Protocol is used between\
    \ the devices in the network.\nArduino Uno microcontroller board and NodeMCU Dev\
    \ Kit ﬁrmware have interfaces with\nthe sensor node. The sensor data is sent by\
    \ Arduino inbuilt WiFi to the ML side. In this\npart, Logistic Regression, Support\
    \ Vector Machine, and Convolutional Neural Networks\nhave been used for modeling.\n\
    Sharma et al. [89] gave a table for ten different IoT disaster management systems\n\
    based on several properties, such as IoT architecture ownership, cloud-enabled,\
    \ computer\ntechnology area, main focus, and disaster type. They also classiﬁed\
    \ IoT-based disaster\nrecovery systems into four groups: Service-oriented, natural,\
    \ artiﬁcial, and post-disaster.\nThey compared IoT-enabled disaster management\
    \ methods according to their wireless\ncommunication technologies, sensor types,\
    \ and some additional features. They also put a\ncomparison diagram exhibiting\
    \ that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi were the best cost, and Bluetooth\nand ZigBee had the\
    \ best power usage among the IoT communication technologies. The au-\nthors proposed\
    \ case studies for forest ﬁre detection and EEWS based on IoT devices. For the\n\
    earthquake warning part, they mentioned the usage of Vibration Sensors (Accelerometer),\n\
    PIC (Peripheral Device Controllers), ZigBee communication procedures, LCD monitors,\n\
    and RS232 cables. An IoT alarm message was sent to smartphones, and an alarm message\n\
    via GSM standard was sent to other cell phones.\nMishra et al. [193] have optimized\
    \ a schedule for distributing relief items using\nIoT technologies, such as smart\
    \ cities. There are some dynamic features dependent on\nthe disaster conditions,\
    \ such as changing relief demand and resource availability. IoT\nis suitable for\
    \ such issues related to continuously ﬂowing and dynamically changing\ndata [194].\
    \ The authors symbolized different time periods with sliding time windows in\n\
    which the data update occurs. For the ﬁrst window, relief distribution is decided\
    \ according\nto the availability of vehicles, relief resources, priority of the\
    \ disaster area, and delivery\nroutes. The distribution schedule has been optimized\
    \ repeatedly in the next time slots.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n18 of 38\n\
    The fragility of the problem that is being targeted, as well as its direct effect\
    \ on human\nlife, makes it imperative that a solution be found that is intelligent,\

    \ the loss of human life, the implementation of an EEWS is an\nabsolute necessity.\
    \ In order to effectively manage disasters and reduce the danger of earth-\nquakes,\
    \ it is essential to have the ability to promptly detect the features of an earthquake.\n\
    With technologies already in place, such as the IoT network, social media, global\
    \ position-\ning system (GPS), and mobile nodes, these attributes can be sent\
    \ to help mitigate the effects\nof a catastrophic earthquake.\nFigure 8 depicts\
    \ a comprehensive EEWS with many administrations assisting in reliev-\ning the\
    \ earthquake tragedy. The EEWS will include complete statistics regarding hospitals,\n\
    railways, ﬁre services, ambulances, airports, and so on based on these administrations.\n\
    This proposed system does integrate social media, IoT technologies, cloud systems,\
    \ and\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n19 of 38\nmobile systems. It operates in\
    \ two stages. The ﬁrst stage is pre-disaster, as ML models\nare used to detect\
    \ the commencement of the principal wave. This procedure is extremely\nadvantageous\
    \ for risk minimization, such as rapid shutting down of nuclear power plants,\n\
    electrical producers, and so on. The second phase begins after the disaster has\
    \ occurred,\nwith the goal of mitigating/reducing the disaster’s impacts. Using\
    \ an integrated system,\nfor example, allows for more accurate statistics regarding\
    \ the affected people, buildings,\nutilities, and areas. As a result, an effective\
    \ evacuation strategy can be implemented.\nA solution that is both ﬂexible and\
    \ intelligent and that is able to deal with complex\nproblems in a relatively\
    \ short amount of time is required for such a system. ML has the\npotential to\
    \ play a signiﬁcant and critical part in the administrations that are interconnected\n\
    and working on achieving successful EWS among the variety of existing current\
    \ techniques.\nML is a promising method that works regardless of the data type,\
    \ format, length, and other\nfactors such as these.\nFigure 8. A general architecture\
    \ of EWS.\nIndeed, real-time monitoring takes place across all of the dispersed\
    \ organizations\nshown in Figure 8, which serves as the foundation for a reliable\
    \ EEWS. As a consequence of\nthis, the transfer of data between various entities\
    \ needs to be thoroughly investigated and\nestimated. After that, ML models are\
    \ utilized to zero in on the current status of each object\nand even provide an\
    \ estimate for a certain word. As a consequence of this, those institutions\n\
    are capable of making useful contributions prior to, during, and after earthquake\
    \ disasters.\nTo put it another way, a technique such as this can assist with\
    \ the management of earthquake\ncatastrophes, the reduction of earthquake risks,\
    \ and evacuation tactics. As a consequence\nof this, the performance of the EEWS\
    \ improves in direct proportion to the quality of the\nML model. Figure 9 provides\
    \ a visual representation of the interaction between trains as\na speciﬁc administration\
    \ used in the process of full EEWS, the data processing, and the\nresearch done.\
    \ To be more precise, earthquake data is monitored to be sent for processing\n\
    using the IoT network in order to carry out the desired check and determine the\
    \ correct\ndecision to send to the railway system for suitable action using an\
    \ ML model and the\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n20 of 38\nrailway information\
    \ of the disaster location. This process is repeated until the appropriate\ndecision\
    \ is made.\nFigure 9. A pattern of Iot-based EEWS.\nThe authors of [197] mentioned\
    \ the same approach of beneﬁting from UAVs as Aerial\nBase Stations (ABSs) to\
    \ provide connectivity instead of traditional base stations. They\nproposed two\
    \ trajectory planning algorithms using a k-value selection method and K-\nmeans\
    \ centroids for UAVs. These UAVs served to the clusters of user equipment. By\n\
    enhancing the study, the authors also gave two methods for cluster head selection\
    \ to\nsupport continuous connectivity via UAVs and cluster heads.\nThe authors\
    \ of [198] suggested a system to ﬁnd the damage degrees of various earth-\nquake\
    \ region parts such as roads and riverways. They used single-rotor and six-rotor\
    \ UAVs\nand took visible light images of the region parts. Once the image quality\
    \ evaluation was\ndone according to the image contrast, the image blur, and the\
    \ image noise formulas, the\naerial images were analyzed with Gray Level Cooccurrence\
    \ Matrix, the Tamura, and the\nGabor wavelet features. Lastly, the SVM classiﬁer\
    \ was used to obtain the damage levels.\nThe authors of [199] proposed to use\
    \ UAVs for monitoring earthquake impacts after\nthe disaster occurrence. The damage\
    \ to the buildings was derived with the help of one ﬁxed-\nwing UAV and two multirotor\
    \ UAVs. The aerial mapping gathered from the UAVs was\ncompared with a physical\
    \ ﬁeld survey. The buildings’ structural properties were extracted\nfrom the damages\
    \ on different parts of the surfaces, such as walls, roofs, and perimeter\ncolumns.\
    \ Additionally, the liquefaction situation was seen from the area investigation\
    \ that\nalso presented the damage levels of the settlements.\nOverall, the use\
    \ of drones in earthquake disaster detection and management has the\npotential\
    \ to save lives, speed up response times, and improve the efﬁciency of emergency\n\
    services. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that drones will become\
    \ an even\nmore important tool in disaster management, helping to mitigate the\
    \ effects of earthquakes\nand other natural disasters. Figure 10 shows the role\
    \ of UAVs for three scenarios of pre,\nduring, and post-disaster situations.\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n21 of 38\nEvaluating the performance and reliability\
    \ of IoT-enabled earthquake early warning\nsystems (EEWS) is crucial for ensuring\
    \ their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. There\nare several techniques that\
    \ can be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the\nperformance and reliability\
    \ of these systems, including simulation testing, ﬁeld testing, and\ndata-driven\
    \ analysis:\n•\nSimulation testing involves creating a virtual environment that\
    \ simulates real-world\nconditions, including seismic activity and sensor data\
    \ [200,201]. Simulation testing\nallows researchers to test the performance of\
    \ an EEWS system under different scenar-\nios, such as different magnitudes and\
    \ distances of earthquakes and different types of\nseismic waves [202]. This technique\
    \ can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of\ndifferent algorithms and\
    \ parameters used in the system [203].\n•\nField testing involves deploying an\
    \ EEWS system in real-world conditions and col-\nlecting data on its performance\
    \ and reliability [204,205]. Field testing can provide\nvaluable insights into\
    \ the system’s performance under actual operating conditions,\nwhich may differ\
    \ from those in a simulated environment. Field testing can also help to\nidentify\
    \ potential issues with the system, such as sensor malfunction or communica-\n\
    tion failures [206]. This technique can be time-consuming and resource-intensive,\
    \ but\nit provides valuable data on the system’s performance and reliability in\
    \ real-world\nscenarios [207].\n•\nData-driven analysis involves analyzing large\
    \ datasets generated by an EEWS system\nto identify patterns and trends, which\
    \ can provide insights into its performance and\nreliability [208]. Data-driven\
    \ analysis can be used to identify correlations between\nsensor data and earthquake\
    \ characteristics, such as magnitude, duration, and inten-\nsity [209]. This technique\
    \ can also be used to identify anomalies in sensor data, which\nmay indicate issues\
    \ with the system’s performance or reliability [210]. Data-driven\nanalysis can\
    \ provide valuable insights into the performance and reliability of an EEWS\n\
    system over long periods of time [211].\nBy using a combination of these techniques,\
    \ researchers can gain a more comprehen-\nsive understanding of the performance\
    \ and reliability of IoT-enabled EEWS systems. This\ncan help to identify areas\
    \ for improvement and ultimately improve the effectiveness of\nthese systems in\
    \ mitigating the impact of earthquakes.\nIntegrating advanced technologies such\
    \ as ML algorithms, distributed computing, and\nedge computing into EEWS systems\
    \ can improve their accuracy and effectiveness. How-\never, there are several\
    \ challenges and considerations associated with these technologies. For\nexample,\
    \ ML algorithms require large amounts of data and computational resources to train\n\
    and optimize, which may be difﬁcult to obtain in the context of EEWS systems [212,213].\n\
    Distributed computing can improve the scalability and fault tolerance of EEWS\
    \ systems,\nbut it also introduces additional complexity and overhead in terms\
    \ of communication and\ncoordination [214–217]. Edge computing can improve the\
    \ responsiveness and efﬁciency\nof EEWS systems by processing data closer to the\
    \ source. Still, it also requires careful\nmanagement of resources and trade-offs\
    \ between processing power and energy consump-\ntion [218,219]. In addition, the\
    \ implementation of these advanced technologies can be\ncomplex and may require\
    \ signiﬁcant expertise and resources. Furthermore, there may be\nlimitations associated\
    \ with the hardware and software infrastructure of EEWS systems,\nsuch as sensor\
    \ networks and communication protocols, which may need to be upgraded or\nmodiﬁed\
    \ to support these technologies. Therefore, while integrating advanced technologies\n\
    into EEWS systems has the potential to improve their accuracy and effectiveness,\
    \ careful\nconsideration of the trade-offs and implementation complexities is\
    \ necessary to ensure\ntheir successful deployment and operation.\nSustainability\

    5. Validation and Veriﬁcation Aspects\nValidation and veriﬁcation (V&V) are essential\
    \ for ensuring the quality, reliability,\noptimization, and safety of systems\
    \ and products [220–222]. They involve rigorous evalu-\nation against requirements\
    \ and standards, identifying and correcting defects, improving\nperformance, and\
    \ ensuring compliance. In the context of IoT systems, V&V is crucial\nfor addressing\
    \ complex behaviors, identifying vulnerabilities, and complying with regu-\nlations\
    \ [223,224]. For cloud systems, V&V ensures dependability, security, performance\n\
    optimization, and adherence to standards [225–227]. Overall, V&V is vital for\
    \ constructing\ntrustworthy, resilient, compliant systems that meet user and societal\
    \ expectations [228].\n5.1. Different Categories of V&V Techniques\nThere are\
    \ several types of validation and veriﬁcation techniques that can be applied to\n\
    these systems [229,230] (Figure 11). One common technique is functional testing,\
    \ which\ninvolves testing the system’s functions to ensure that they perform as\
    \ expected [231]. This\ntesting can be done manually or through automated testing\
    \ tools. Another technique is\nperformance testing, which involves testing the\
    \ system’s ability to handle a certain level\nof workload or trafﬁc [232]. This\
    \ can include stress testing, load testing, and capacity\ntesting [233,234].\n\
    Security testing is another important technique for IoT and cloud systems [235–237].\n\
    This involves testing the system’s security features and protocols to identify\
    \ vulnerabilities\nand ensure that sensitive information is protected [238–240].\
    \ Penetration testing is a type\nof security testing that involves attempting\
    \ to hack into the system to identify weaknesses\nand potential security breaches\
    \ [241–243].\nUsability testing is also important for these systems, as they must\
    \ be user-friendly and\neasy to navigate [244]. This testing involves gathering\
    \ feedback from users to identify areas\nof the system that can be improved to\
    \ enhance the user experience [245].\nRegression testing is another important\
    \ technique for IoT and cloud systems [246,247].\nIt involves retesting the system\
    \ after making changes or updates to ensure that the changes\nhave not introduced\
    \ new defects or issues in previously tested areas [248]. Regression\ntesting\
    \ can be done manually or through automated testing tools, and it is important\
    \ to\nperform regularly to ensure that the system remains stable and reliable\
    \ throughout its\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n23 of 38\nlifecycle [249,250].\
    \ By conducting thorough regression testing, developers can identify and\nﬁx issues\

    \nDĞƚŚŽĚƐ\nFigure 11. Different Categories of V&V Techniques.\nFormal methods\
    \ (Figure 12) are another important set of techniques that can be used\nfor validation\
    \ and veriﬁcation of IoT and cloud systems [252,253]. Formal methods involve\n\
    the use of mathematical models and logic to verify the correctness and reliability\
    \ of a\nsystem [254]. This technique can be used to check the consistency of the\
    \ system design and\nits speciﬁcations, as well as to identify potential errors\
    \ and defects in the system [255,256].\nFormal methods can also be used to ensure\
    \ that the system meets certain performance and\nsafety requirements [257–259].\
    \ While formal methods can be more time-consuming and\ncomplex than other validation\
    \ and veriﬁcation techniques, they can provide a high level\nof conﬁdence in the\
    \ correctness and reliability of the system [260–262]. Therefore, formal\nmethods\
    \ are an important tool for developers to consider when designing and testing\
    \ IoT\nand cloud systems.\n&ŽƌŵĂů\x03\nDĞƚŚŽĚƐ\nDĂƚŚĞŵĂƚŝĐĂů\x03\nWƌŽƉĞƌƚŝĞƐ\n\

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n24 of 38\nIn addition to these techniques, there\
    \ are also validation and verification techniques\nspecific to cloud systems.\
    \ For example, validation techniques for cloud systems may\ninclude compliance\
    \ testing to ensure that the system complies with industry standards\nand regulations\
    \ and testing the system’s ability to handle real-time data processing\nand communication.\n\
    Overall, validation and veriﬁcation techniques are critical for ensuring the reliability,\n\
    security, and efﬁciency of IoT and cloud systems. By applying these techniques,\
    \ developers\ncan identify and address issues early in the development process,\
    \ ultimately leading to\nbetter-performing and more secure systems for users.\n\
    5.2. Adaptation of V&V Techniques for EEWS\nVeriﬁcation and validation (V&V) techniques\
    \ are crucial for ensuring the reliability\nand effectiveness of earthquake detection\
    \ and warning systems in the context of IoT.\nThese systems use a combination\
    \ of sensors, data analysis algorithms, and communication\ntechnologies to detect\
    \ and respond to earthquakes in real time. However, the adaptation of\nV&V techniques\
    \ for these systems presents unique challenges and opportunities.\nOne challenge\
    \ is the need for a robust and reliable sensor network. EEWS relies on a\nsensor\
    \ network to detect and measure seismic activity. These sensors must be calibrated\n\
    and tested regularly to ensure that they are functioning correctly. V&V techniques\
    \ can\nhelp to ensure that the sensor network is reliable and accurate by providing\
    \ a framework\nfor testing and calibration. More precisely, to ensure the reliability\
    \ and accuracy of the\nentire sensor network, a statistical calibration and testing\
    \ approach can be employed. This\ninvolves validating a representative sample\
    \ of sensors rather than individually testing\neach sensor, given the large number\
    \ of sensors typically used. Statistically, the majority of\nsensors will be sufﬁciently\
    \ calibrated and functioning properly at the time of an earthquake.\nAnother challenge\
    \ is the desirability of real-time data analysis and action plans. In\nearthquake\
    \ detection systems, timely and accurate decision-making is critical for minimiz-\n\
    ing damage and saving lives. V&V techniques can help to ensure that the data analysis\n\
    algorithms used in these systems are accurate and reliable. This can involve testing\
    \ the\nalgorithms under a variety of conditions and scenarios, as well as ensuring\
    \ that they are\nable to operate in real time.\nIn addition to challenges, there\
    \ are also opportunities for the adaptation of V&V\ntechniques for IoT earthquake\
    \ systems. One opportunity is the use of simulation and\nmodeling. V&V techniques\
    \ can be used to create simulations and models of earthquake\nscenarios to test\
    \ and validate the performance of the detection and warning systems. This\ncan\
    \ help to identify potential weaknesses in the system and inform improvements.\n\
    Another opportunity is the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science. V&V techniques\n\
    can be used to validate and integrate data from citizen scientists and volunteers\
    \ who\ncontribute to earthquake detection and warning systems. This can help to\
    \ improve the\naccuracy and reliability of the system while also engaging the\
    \ public in the process.\nIn conclusion, the adaptation of V&V techniques for\
    \ IoT earthquake systems presents\nboth challenges and opportunities. By leveraging\
    \ V&V techniques, developers can ensure\nthat these systems are reliable, accurate,\
    \ and effective in detecting and responding to seismic\nactivity. This can help\
    \ to minimize damage and save lives in the event of an earthquake.\n5.3. Cost\
    \ and Limitations of V&V Techniques\nVeriﬁcation and validation (V&V) techniques\
    \ are crucial in ensuring the quality and\nreliability of software systems for\
    \ IoT and cloud computing systems. However, these\nsystems come with unique challenges\
    \ and limitations that must be considered when\nimplementing V&V techniques.\n\
    One cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the sheer scale of these\n\
    systems. These systems can involve thousands or even millions of interconnected\
    \ devices,\nmaking it difﬁcult to perform comprehensive testing and validation.\
    \ Additionally, the het-\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n25 of 38\nerogeneity\
    \ of these systems, with devices from different manufacturers and with different\n\
    capabilities, can complicate the veriﬁcation and validation process.\nAnother\
    \ cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the need for specialized\n\
    testing environments and tools. These systems require highly specialized tools\
    \ and environ-\nments for testing and validation, such as simulators, emulators,\
    \ and testbeds. These tools\ncan be expensive to implement and maintain and may\
    \ require highly skilled personnel to\noperate effectively.\nFurthermore, there\
    \ are limitations to the effectiveness of V&V techniques for IoT\nand cloud systems.\
    \ One limitation is the difﬁculty of testing for security and privacy\nvulnerabilities.\
    \ These systems often involve sensitive data and critical infrastructure,\nmaking\
    \ security and privacy a top priority. However, it is challenging to test for\
    \ all possible\nsecurity and privacy vulnerabilities, especially as new threats\
    \ emerge constantly.\nAnother limitation is the challenge of testing for real-time\
    \ and low-latency require-\nments. IoT and cloud systems often require real-time\
    \ performance and low-latency commu-\nnication, which can be difﬁcult to test\
    \ and validate. These systems may involve complex\ninteractions between devices\
    \ and services, making it challenging to ensure that they meet\nthese requirements.\n\
    In conclusion, V&V techniques are crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability\
    \ of\nsoftware systems for IoT and cloud computing systems. However, these systems\
    \ have\nunique challenges and limitations that must be considered when implementing\
    \ V&V\ntechniques. By understanding these costs and limitations, software developers\
    \ can imple-\nment V&V techniques more effectively and efﬁciently, ultimately\
    \ leading to higher-quality\nsoftware systems.\n6. Open Challenges, Conclusions\
    \ and Future Directions\nThe use of IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents\
    \ signiﬁcant opportunities for\nimproving the speed and accuracy of earthquake\
    \ detection and response. However, there\nare also several challenges that must\
    \ be addressed to ensure the reliability and effectiveness\nof these systems (Figure\
    \ 13).\n•\nSensor network reliability and accuracy: One of the primary challenges\
    \ in implement-\ning IoT and cloud-based EEWS is ensuring the reliability and\
    \ accuracy of the sensor\nnetwork. These systems rely on a network of sensors\
    \ to detect and measure seismic\nactivity, making it essential to ensure that\
    \ the sensors are functioning correctly.\n•\nReal-time data processing and decision-making:\
    \ EEWS require fast and accurate\ndata processing and decision-making capabilities\
    \ to provide timely alerts to people\nand organizations in affected areas. This\
    \ requires sophisticated algorithms and real-\ntime data processing capabilities,\
    \ which can be challenging to implement in IoT and\ncloud-based systems.\n•\n\
    Secure communication channels: The transmission of data between sensors, cloud\n\
    facilities, and other components in an EEWS must be secure to prevent unauthorized\n\
    access and tampering. Ensuring the security of communication channels is a signiﬁcant\n\
    challenge in designing and implementing these systems.\n•\nHeterogeneity and scalability:\
    \ IoT and cloud-based systems are inherently heteroge-\nneous, with devices and\
    \ services from different manufacturers and with different capa-\nbilities. Ensuring\
    \ seamless integration and scalability of these systems is a signiﬁcant\nchallenge,\
    \ particularly as the number of devices and sensors in the network increases.\n\
    •\nCost-effectiveness and sustainability: Implementing an EEWS using IoT and cloud\n\
    facilities can be costly, requiring signiﬁcant investment in hardware, software,\
    \ and\npersonnel. Ensuring the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of these\
    \ systems is a\nsigniﬁcant challenge, particularly in regions with limited resources.\n\
    •\nUsability and accessibility: EEWS must be usable and accessible to people and\
    \ orga-\nnizations in affected areas, including those with limited literacy or\
    \ technical skills.\nEnsuring the usability and accessibility of these systems\
    \ is a signiﬁcant challenge,\nrequiring careful consideration of user needs and\
    \ preferences.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n26 of 38\n•\nPrivacy and ethical\
    \ concerns: The collection and processing of data in EEWS raise\nprivacy and ethical\
    \ concerns, particularly as these systems become more sophisticated\nand widespread.\
    \ Ensuring that these systems comply with relevant regulations and\nethical principles\
    \ is a signiﬁcant challenge.\n•\nInterference from environmental factors: EEWS\
    \ can be affected by environmental\nfactors such as electromagnetic noise and\
    \ weather conditions, which can interfere\nwith the accuracy and reliability of\
    \ the sensor network. Ensuring the robustness and\nresilience of these systems\
    \ is a signiﬁcant challenge, requiring careful consideration of\nenvironmental\
    \ factors.\n•\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance: IoT and cloud-based EEWS\
    \ require con-\ntinuous monitoring and maintenance to ensure system performance\
    \ and reliability.\nEnsuring the continuous monitoring and maintenance of these\
    \ systems is a signiﬁcant\nchallenge, requiring robust and scalable infrastructure\
    \ and skilled personnel.\n^ĞŶƐŽƌ\x03EĞƚǁŽƌŬ\x03\nZĞůŝĂďŝůŝƚǇ\x03ĂŶĚ\x03\n\x04\

    \ IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents a signiﬁcant opportunity for\nimproving\
    \ the speed and accuracy of earthquake detection and response. However, ad-\n\
    dressing the challenges outlined above is essential to ensure the reliability\
    \ and sustainability\nof these systems in the long term. This survey has highlighted\
    \ the potential beneﬁts of\nusing IoT and cloud technologies in EEWS, including\
    \ real-time data analysis, improved\nsensor networks, and faster decision-making.\
    \ However, the survey has also identiﬁed\nseveral challenges that must be addressed,\
    \ such as the need for reliable and accurate sensor\nnetworks, real-time data\
    \ processing, and secure communication channels. Overall, the\nsurvey underscores\
    \ the importance of continued research and development in this area, as\nwell\
    \ as the need for rigorous veriﬁcation and validation techniques to ensure the\
    \ reliability\nand effectiveness of these systems. Below, we propose some interesting\
    \ future directions:\n1.\nDevelopment of more efﬁcient and accurate sensors: Research\
    \ and development\nshould focus on developing more efﬁcient and accurate sensors\
    \ that can accurately\ndetect and measure seismic activity while also being cost-effective\
    \ and scalable.\n2.\nIntegration of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and ML: The integration\
    \ of AI and ML can\nhelp to improve the accuracy and reliability of data analysis\
    \ algorithms used in EEWS.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n27 of 38\nThis can\
    \ lead to faster and more accurate decision-making, improving the effectiveness\n\
    of these systems [264,265].\n3.\nStandardization of communication protocols: The\
    \ standardization of communication\nprotocols can help to ensure the interoperability\
    \ and scalability of IoT and cloud-based\nEEWS. This can simplify the integration\
    \ of different devices and services, reducing\nthe complexity of these systems.\n\
    4.\nAdoption of free, open-source software: The adoption of free, open-source\
    \ software\ncan help to reduce the cost and complexity of developing EEWS while\
    \ also encourag-\ning collaboration and innovation in this area.\n5.\nEngagement\
    \ with local communities: Engagement with local communities can help\nto ensure\
    \ that EEWS are developed in a form that meets the needs and preferences\nof people\
    \ and organizations in affected areas. This can improve the usability and\neffectiveness\
    \ of these systems in real-world scenarios.\n6.\nDevelopment of new funding models:\
    \ The development of new funding models, such\nas public–private partnerships,\
    \ can help to ensure the sustainability and scalability\nof EEWS. This can provide\
    \ the necessary resources and expertise to develop and\nmaintain these systems\
    \ over the long term.\n7.\nThe “last kilometer” problem: This problem is the difﬁculty\
    \ of assuring prompt and\nefﬁcient warning, communication, and reaction systems\
    \ to people and communities in\nthe ﬁnal seconds before the occurrence of powerful\
    \ and devastating S-wave shaking\nduring an earthquake. In particular, it requires\
    \ addressing densely populated areas\nwhere the window for preparation and evacuation\
    \ is constrained, where there is a\ngap between earthquake EEWS and the capacity\
    \ to reach and notify individuals in the\nimpacted area. In order to protect people’s\
    \ safety and well-being in the ﬁnal crucial\nseconds before the arrival of the\
    \ destructive seismic waves, this topic focuses on the\nnecessity for the effective\
    \ broadcast of alerts and emergency instructions.\nIn conclusion, continued research\
    \ and development, as well as collaboration and inno-\nvation, will be essential\
    \ in addressing the challenges and realizing the potential beneﬁts of\nusing IoT\
    \ and cloud facilities for EEWS. By addressing these challenges and implementing\n\
    future directions, it is possible to develop more reliable, accurate, and effective\
    \ EEWS that\ncan save lives and minimize damage in the event of seismic activity.\n\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges

    DOI 10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, no other invention\
    \ has generated as much\nexcitement in the computing world as the Internet. Because\
    \ of its\ntremendous strength and breadth of uses, it is virtually ubiquitous\n\
    in every sector of human endeavor (Kumar et al., 2017; Poyen et al.,\n2020; Terence\
    \ and Purushothaman, 2020). People and\norganizations have connected with amazing\
    \ agility and\nconvenience in recent years, thanks to a vast 5G network of\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs), healthcare services, cellphones,\nand various sorts\
    \ of pervasive real-time monitoring systems\n(Lakshmiprabha and Govindaraju, 2019;\
    \ Hassan et al., 2021). The\nhuman population is expanding at an alarming rate,\
    \ but at the same\ntime, pollution is slowly depleting the earth’s water and land\n\
    supplies. Smart agriculture is seen as playing a crucial role in\nresponding to\
    \ these issues. Smart agriculture has the potential to\nvastly enhance both the\
    \ agroecological setting and the yield and\nquality of agricultural products while\
    \ simultaneously decreasing the\nneed for harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ (Zhang et al.,\n2022). The use of ICTs to automate and intelligently manage\n\
    agricultural cultivation and production is central to the concept\nof “smart agriculture.”\
    \ In particular, wireless communications play\na signiﬁcant role in the growth\
    \ of agriculture, and each new\ngeneration of wireless communication technology\
    \ propels farming\ntoward a higher level of intelligence.\nPeople and objects\
    \ may connect in real-time thanks to the 5G\nnetwork-based Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), which provides important\nservices and value to millions of people across\
    \ the world (Guevara\net al., 2020; Biswal et al., 2021). 5G network-based IoT\
    \ has\ndeveloped organically into a gigantic technology platform. South\nAmerica\
    \ has initiated a yearly warm-season tomato yield that\nbelongs to the Solanaceae\
    \ family (Van Eck et al., 2019; Kumar\net al., 2022).\nDespite requiring high\
    \ amounts of fertilizer, tomato is a\npopular or demanding plant due to its health\
    \ signiﬁcance to the\nwhole world, with high levels of antioxidants such as carotenoid,\n\
    lycopene, and vitamins C and A and phenolic compounds, which\nprovide a wide range\
    \ of health advantages for the consumers\n(Campestrini et al., 2019; Samanta et\
    \ al., 2020; Chen P. et al.,\n2021). Tshiala and Olwoch reported that tomatoes\
    \ have been used\nin food preparation throughout the world as fresh vegetables\
    \ or as\nspices. It has a vital role in the Ethiopian marketing of vegetables\n\
    (Guodaar et al., 2020; Biswas et al., 2021). The production of\ntomatoes was used\
    \ as a job opportunity and as an income source\nfor producers.\nNutrient and water\
    \ supplies have a signiﬁcant impact on tomato\nquality, and their highest water\
    \ demand is quoted in an unpublished\npaper. Some poisonous elements and inorganic\
    \ substances that are\ndangerous to people can demonstrate water quality (Sanjuan-Delm´\n\
    as et al., 2020; Chen P. et al., 2021). This may be a problem for\nirrigation\
    \ using municipal wastewater. Although municipal\nwastewaters have been applied\
    \ as much as possible to irrigation,\nthey contain comparatively maximum sodium\
    \ quantities that can\nbe accumulated with this wastewater and have toxic effects\
    \ on plant\nsoils during optimized irrigation (Jayalakshmi and Gomathi, 2019;\n\
    Leuther et al., 2019; Casadei et al., 2021). The various types of crop\ngrowth\
    \ models are extremely useful in optimizing irrigation\npractices which are based\
    \ on physical or semi-empirical equations\nfor simpliﬁcation of the complex mechanism\
    \ and also having many\nparameters in the process (Sanjuan-Delm´as et al., 2020).\
    \ Because\nof its balance of simplicity, accuracy, and robustness, the AquaCrop\n\
    model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\nhas provided a\
    \ method for calculating crop yields and optimal\nirrigation scheduling for various\
    \ crops in different climates. In the\ncurrent real-time model, parameters like\
    \ soil moisture (SM), crop\ncultivation, leaf area index (LAI), or canopy cover\
    \ (CC) are\ncollected using various remote sensing devices. As a result, this\n\
    real-time cultivation process is an upgraded and fully dynamic\nversion of the\
    \ traditional models (Leuther et al., 2019; Chen P.\net al., 2021).\nA fast and\
    \ dependable Internet connection is necessary for\nagricultural IoT devices to\
    \ function. The current generation of\nmobile networks is failing due to insufﬁcient\
    \ connectivity in rural\nareas, and even in areas with high-speed access, failure\
    \ occurs due to\nmassive demand. According to a recent survey, nearly 80% of rural\n\
    areas, even in the United Kingdom, are outside of the 4G range. The\ncurrent degree\
    \ of network access in rural areas is insufﬁcient in most\nnations (Tang et al.,\
    \ 2021). In addition, in some developed\ncountries, there are multiple farms with\
    \ a large number of IoT\ndevices and machines that require a constant reliable\
    \ high-speed\nInternet connection to exchange a large amount of data, and the\n\
    technologies of the current generation of mobile networks cannot\ncope with these\
    \ demands (Singh et al., 2022). To fulﬁll these goals,\nmany promising technologies,\
    \ such as massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO), network slicing, and\
    \ smaller cells, are\nneeded to provide reliable connectivity over a larger distance.\n\
    Therefore, the smart mobile network is well suited to support\nsmart farming by\
    \ enabling wide coverage, low-energy\nconsumption, low-cost devices, and high\
    \ spectrum efﬁciency.\nUnfortunately, the IoT-based network’s usage of microwaves\n\
    (MWs) as carriers limits its ability to cover wide areas. The\nintroduction of\
    \ small base stations spaced at roughly 250 m\nintervals over coverage regions\
    \ that can be extended to any size\nallows for continuous connectivity, thanks\
    \ to the small cell\nconcept. In order to link the bigger areas, the related small\n\
    towers can be placed everywhere (on lamp posts, in trees, on\nroofs, on tops of\
    \ vehicles, etc.). Similar to 4G, this implementation\nmakes use of the massive\
    \ MIMO approach by equipping nodes\nwith many antennas for sending and receiving\
    \ data in order to\nincrease the network’s capacity. On the other hand, huge MIMO\n\
    makes signal interference more likely. Beamforming is used to\nincrease the throughput\
    \ of transmitted data and thereby solve this\nissue. Beamforming refers to an\
    \ antenna’s capability of directing\nfocused beams of radio waves at speciﬁc targets.\
    \ An advanced\nInternet connection provides very high (MW) operating\nfrequencies,\
    \ and the accompanying high bandwidth makes it\npossible for larger and more rapid\
    \ data transactions. In contrast\nto the static channels used by the 4G network,\
    \ the cognitive radio\napproach used by the smart network allows for device-speciﬁc\n\
    channel allocation.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant\
    \ Science\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nIn 2017, for the ﬁrst time, the 5G RuralFirst\
    \ project successfully\nplanted and harvested a crop using autonomous tractors\
    \ to sow\nseeds, drones to monitor crops, and machines to apply water,\nfertilizer,\
    \ and pesticides. The entire procedure was carried out\nwithout the need for any\
    \ laborers. Another initiative, Hands Free\nHectare, claimed a successful harvest\
    \ in 2018 (Al-Ghobari and\nMohammad, 2011). With greater technological breakthroughs,\
    \ 5G\nis projected to promote precision farming. As IoT-based network\ncoverage\
    \ grows, agricultural sector producers will beneﬁt greatly,\nallowing them to\
    \ manage farms, animals, and other assets from the\ncomfort of their own homes,\
    \ thanks to their big capacity, fast data\nspeed, and low latency. Smart technology\
    \ will help to advance IoT\nsensor connectivity to the next level, paving the\
    \ way for\nunprecedented innovation in smart farming components.\nImplementing\
    \ technology to automate, track, and monitor\nagricultural processes is a wise\
    \ solution to the irrigation problem.\nThe traditional irrigation method is fully\
    \ automated by using IoT\nintegration modules. However, with an advanced network\
    \ on the\nhorizon, smart agriculture will take off with lightning-fast\ndata transfer.\n\
    To improve farm produce quality, smart farming combines\ntraditional agronomic\
    \ practices with the IoT. The application of\nnew technology in agriculture can\
    \ assist farmers in reducing labor\nand costs while increasing crop yield and\
    \ production. To facilitate\nall of these agricultural beneﬁts, the IoT includes\
    \ a wide range of\ncomponents under digital and automated technologies. So, IoT-\n\
    based connectivity will vastly increase the impact due to low latency,\nhigh bandwidth,\
    \ and support for many sensors communicating at\nthe same time.\nThe IoT technology\
    \ platform already helps to increase\nproductivity and ensure proper resource\
    \ utilization through\nprecision agriculture. The implementation of IoT, on the\
    \ other\nhand, will help to accelerate the entire process with machine-to-\nmachine\
    \ services. The real-time data transfer capabilities of the IoT\nmodule can aid\
    \ in the rapid operation of these solutions, making\ndecision-making quick, robust,\
    \ data-oriented, and real-time. With\nan IoT-based network, these devices can\
    \ send real-time data about\nthe need for optimal irrigation, spoilt crops, and\
    \ their location to\nfollow-up machinery. Farmers can save time and money by\n\
    harvesting crops quickly and effectively with automated irrigation\nfor tomato\
    \ crop cultivation.\nThe key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n•\n\
    An efﬁcient IoT-based framework is proposed for tomato\ncultivation.\n•\nMoisture\
    \ levels in the soil are predicted with the help of IoT\nmodules to optimize the\
    \ irrigation system.\n•\nA mobile application is also developed that can help\
    \ farmers\nby providing useful information.\nThe remaining parts of the paper\
    \ are arranged as follows. Section\n2 discusses the literature review. Section\
    \ 3 explains the things used\nfor designing smart farming solutions. Section 4\
    \ details the proposed\nsystem and the methodology. The simulation setup and results\n\
    analyses are described in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2 Literature\
    \ review\nChen et al. (2019) discussed the proper utilization of water for\nthe\
    \ growth of tomatoes by using the fuzzy neural network with a\ngenetic algorithm\
    \ (GA). It predicted the volume of irrigation based\non the effect of greenhouse\
    \ and the growth of crops (Guha et al.,\n2021). Rodrı́guez et al (Rodr´ıguez-Ortega\
    \ et al., 2019). developed a\nsoilless technique to yield tomato crops through\
    \ the treatment of\nsalinity. Here, the salinity treatment was speciﬁcally used\
    \ to\nimprove the production of vegetables and nutritional imbalance\n(psychological\
    \ of plants) for crops. Zhai et al. (2015) proposed an\nidea for the cultivation\
    \ of tomatoes using saline water and the\nblossom-end rot technique. Implementing\
    \ these two yield methods\nenhanced the level of production.\nIn the study of\
    \ Shao et al. (2014), two levels of irrigation\ntechniques were designed for heavy\
    \ rain shelters and drainage\ntreatments for improving the productivity of crops.\
    \ An optimum\nirrigation management technique was designed for yielding quality\n\
    tomatoes through the proper arrangement of rain shelters (Keswani\net al., 2020;\
    \ Maroli et al., 2021; Mousavi et al., 2021). In the study of\nGil et al. (2019),\
    \ the smart grid system monitored the precision for\nirrigation of water on demand\
    \ using IoT. The authors added\ndesalination and solar energy processes in the\
    \ agricultural system\nfor efﬁcient cultivation.\nKrishna et al. (2017) designed\
    \ a smart farming method for\nintelligent water-saving irrigation using the Raspberry\
    \ Pi module\nand sensors. So, it automated the yielding of crops in a higher range\n\
    that regulates through IoT modules. Qiu et al. (2020) implemented\nan in-depth\
    \ process to collect phenotypic parameters for measuring\nthe growth of tomatoes.\
    \ This system precisely calculated the\ndeﬁciency of water level and fertilizer\
    \ with the help of a neural\nnetwork algorithm for the growth cycle of tomato\
    \ (Khamparia et al.,\n2020; Biswal et al., 2021). An intelligent irrigation system\
    \ was\ndeﬁned as the water requirement for the yielding of tomatoes\nduring a\
    \ various range of climate states by Mason et al. (2019). In\nthis study, smart\
    \ irrigation was used in an adverse situation through\nproper integration of the\
    \ IoT module, sensors, and connectionless\nenvironments (Chen M. et al., 2021).\n\
    In the agriculture industry, 4G/3G/NB-IoT wireless network\ntechnology is used\
    \ to connect IoT-based smart devices for the\npurposes of data sharing, precise\
    \ assessment, accurate calculation,\netc (Dell’Uomo and Scarrone, 2002). Although\
    \ the 3G/4G\nnetworking paradigm has shown much promise, there are still\nseveral\
    \ obstacles that may prevent it from being used to its full\npotential in the\
    \ agriculture sector. One of the main restraints is the\navailable working space.\
    \ Existing wireless networks do not reach out\nto rural areas or dense urban neighborhoods.\
    \ Channel\ncircumstances, resource allocation, ﬂuctuating data rates, and\nhandoff\
    \ problems between diverse networks all make it difﬁcult to\nfacilitate quality\
    \ of service (QoS) in 4G networks (Payaswini and\nManjaiah, 2014; Payero et al.,\
    \ 2017). Mobile devices in this network\nhave a short lifespan due to the utilization\
    \ of many antennas and\ntransmitters. Many modern agricultural sectors rely on\
    \ battery-\npowered technologies like drones and robots, but these have limited\n\
    usefulness in far-ﬂung crop ﬁelds. The number of IoT devices used\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n03\nin\
    \ smart farming, as well as the amount of research done on these\ndevices, is\
    \ growing rapidly, necessitating greater intelligence, speed,\nscalability, secure\
    \ communication capabilities, and processing\npower to handle the numerous complex\
    \ computational tasks and\nheavily utilized services. Having ultralow latency\
    \ in addition to high\nconnection is necessary for IoT devices to achieve quick\n\
    performance and low costs.\nThe current 4G networks (LTE) are limited in their\
    \ ability to\nenable such functionalities because they only permit connectivity\n\
    through IP-based packet switching (Zhaogan et al., 2007). The shift\nto 5G cellular\
    \ networks will eliminate these problems caused by\nprevious generations of wireless\
    \ technology. Due to advancements\nin 5G connectivity, farmers now have the option\
    \ of remotely\npiloting a drone over extensive distances, either manually or via\n\
    predetermined checkpoints (Faraci et al., 2018; Sinha and\nDhanalakshmi, 2022).\
    \ A farmer can get high-deﬁnition video\nstreams and other critical sensory data\
    \ and telemetry from drones\nin real time over the 5G cellular network, which\
    \ is more efﬁcient\nand reliable than previous-generation mobile networks\n(Bhattacharya\
    \ and De, 2021). Due to 5G technology, drones will\nnot need to carry a lot of\
    \ computing power and instead can upload\ntheir data to the cloud, where it will\
    \ be processed more quickly.\nTo demonstrate the importance of smart agriculture,\n\
    Thilakarathne et al. (2023) show a cloud-enabled, low-cost\nsensorized Internet\
    \ of Things platform for monitoring and\nautomating processes related to a tomato\
    \ plantation in a\ncontrolled indoor setting. We hope that the information gleaned\n\
    from this study will be used as a foundation for advancing smart\nagriculture\
    \ solutions that boost productivity and quality and pave\nthe way for a more sustainable\
    \ future.\nUsman et al. (2022) present a 6G use case for plant health\nmonitoring\
    \ using a terahertz (THz)-signal-based integrated\nsensor and communication system.\
    \ Precision agriculture is best\nunderstood as a smart management system with\
    \ the capacity to\ntrack and regulate plant health and water levels on both a\n\
    microscopic and a macro scale. The objective is to maximize\noutput while minimizing\
    \ waste of scarce resources. THz-based\nsensing technology, which can evaluate\
    \ plant health on a cellular\nlevel, combined with wireless sensor networks installed\
    \ within\ncrops to monitor multiple variables while making intelligent\ndecisions,\
    \ could have signiﬁcant implications for agriculture. A\nsustainable communication\
    \ infrastructure that takes into account\nthe needs of dispersed and adaptable\
    \ agricultural settings is\nnecessary for the integration and operation of such\
    \ a macro–\nnano-sensor system.\n3 Materials and methods\nThe growth and productivity\
    \ of plants depend mainly on how\nmuch water is formed during the seedling phase.\
    \ During this time,\nwater demand has an important effect on crops, which have\
    \ many\nenvironmental aspects like temperature, quality of soil, etc. The\napplication\
    \ of IoT in agriculture is limitless, which provides various\nintelligent devices\
    \ to improve yielding performance and proﬁt\n(Gomathy et al., 2020; Sivakumar\
    \ et al., 2020). However, there are\nvarious issues with investing in smart cultivation\
    \ and also difﬁculty\nin the development of agriculture-related IoT apps (Kamienski\n\
    et al., 2019; Conesa et al., 2021).\na) Hardware unit:\nThe information will inﬂuence\
    \ the development of IoT\nsolutions for farming, and there is a need to select\
    \ sensors to\ncreate the custom device that will collect data for the proposed\n\
    solution (Althar and Samanta, 2021; Guha and Samanta, 2021;\nZhang et al., 2021).\
    \ However, the quality of the sensors has a crucial\npart in production which\
    \ depends on the exactness of the collected\ndata and its consistency.\nb) Brain\
    \ unit:\nSmart agriculture should be used as data analytics for a design\nsolution\
    \ that will be helpful if yeomen cannot make sense of it, so\nthere is a need\
    \ to use powerful data analytics techniques and relate\npredictive algorithms\
    \ and machine learning methods for\ncollecting data.\nc) Maintenance unit:\nHardware\
    \ maintenance is a signiﬁcant challenge for IoT-based\nagriculture, while the\
    \ sensors are commonly used in the crop ﬁeld.\nThere are more chances for damaged\
    \ sensors, which needs to be\naddressed by making a smart device that is robust\
    \ and easy to\nsustain. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced with another sensor.\n\
    d) Mobility stage:\nSmart farming applications can be remotely monitored through\n\
    a smartphone or desktop computer for transmitting related yielding\ninformation\
    \ to the owner (Maheswari et al., 2021; Mekala et al.,\n2021). The integration\
    \ of devices should be autonomous and also\ncover enough wireless range to communicate\
    \ and send data to the\ncentral server.\ne) Infrastructure unit:\nA solid and\
    \ robust internal infrastructure needs to ensure that\nthe intelligent cropping\
    \ process performs well and securely handles\nthe data load in it.\nIf the process\
    \ disables the security, someone easily breaks the\nentire system and steals related\
    \ data or controls intelligent devices.\n3.1 Agricultural/crop production system\n\
    The cultivation model can be used to monitor or calculate the\namount of native\
    \ agricultural products, depending upon the\ncultivated area and supported by\
    \ the decision support system\n(Nagarajan and Minu, 2018). Figure 1 shows the\
    \ agricultural/crop\nproduction prediction factors.\nThe number of exports and\
    \ imports of agricultural products can\nbe derived from the prediction model of\
    \ the National Statistical\nOfﬁce’s (NSO) statistics database as depicted in this\
    \ section. The\nagricultural product crop and yielded area models are worked under\n\
    the production of the smart agricultural prediction model, which\nevaluates the\
    \ updated method as well as the predecessor observation\nmethod to reinterpret\
    \ it.\nlnAx,t = a0 + a1lnRPx,t−1 + a2lnRPy,t + a3lnAx,t−1\n(1)\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n04\nwhere\
    \ Ax,t is seeding in x yield design at t year, Ax,t−1 is seeding\nin x yield design\
    \ at t−1 year, RPx,t−1 is the marketplace value in x\nyield design at t−1 year,\
    \ and RPy,t is the market place value in y yield\ndesign at t year.\nY Dx,t =\
    \ b0 + b1WT1\nx,t + b2WT2\nx,t\n(2)\nwhere Y Dx,t is the crop in x yield design\
    \ at t year, WTx,t\n1 is the\nweather (temperature) in x yield design at t year,\
    \ and WTx,t\n2 is the\nclimate (amount of rainfall) in x yield design at t year.\n\
    The quantity of domestic products is the summation of\nagricultural products of\
    \ all individual yield areas and each\nfunctional value of it (Gurunath et al.,\
    \ 2018; Mohanty et al., 2019;\nBenyezza et al., 2021). The agricultural product\
    \ amount is the\nmultiplication of the ﬁeld with the crop model.\nThe demand method\
    \ of the crop is the multiplication of the\ndemand method per method in addition\
    \ to the demands of the\nwhole community. The resource purposes of agricultural\
    \ products\ndepend on export and import scenarios and other supporting\nfactors,\
    \ as depicted in Figure 1. The above equations must follow\n“Nerlove’s partial\
    \ adjustment model,” and the regional weather\ninformation can help concede the\
    \ prediction although there are\nsome missing values (El-Zawily et al., 2019).\n\
    3.2 Challenges in the purpose system\nDespite the many advantages that the 3G/4G\
    \ networking\nparadigm offers, there are still several obstacles that prevent\
    \ it\nfrom being used to its full potential in the agriculture industry.\nSpace\
    \ constraints pose serious problems. Current wireless networks\nare unable to\
    \ reach more remote places or crowded metropolitan\nneighborhoods. Supporting\
    \ the quality of service (QoS) in 4G\nnetworks is difﬁcult due to channel conditions,\
    \ resource\nallocation, varying data rates, and handoff problems between\nheterogeneous\
    \ networks. Due to the heavy use of antennae and\ntransmitters in this network,\
    \ the lifespan of mobile devices is short.\nIn order for Internet of Things devices\
    \ to deliver quick performance\nat low prices, ultralow latency must be paired\
    \ with a strong\nconnection. Due to the limitations of IP-based packet switching\n\
    connectivity on the existing 4G network (LTE), such features are\nnow unavailable.\
    \ These issues, which have plagued earlier\ngenerations of cellular networks,\
    \ will be eradicated with the\ntransition to IoT-based networks.\nDue to its massive\
    \ data capacity and speeds greater than 10 Gbps,\nIoT-based connection will be\
    \ able to link billions of devices. For both\ndownload and upload speeds, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to be up to 100\ntimes faster than their 4G and 4G LTE predecessors.\
    \ 5G can connect\nbillions of devices due to its increased bandwidth, in addition\
    \ to its large\ndata capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. The download and\
    \ upload\nspeeds of IoT-based networks will be up to 100 times faster than those\
    \ of\n4G and 4G LTE networks. Consequently, a 2-h movie that would take 6\nmin\
    \ to download on 4G would take less than 4 s to download on an\nadvanced network.\
    \ Technical speciﬁcations for 5G are being developed\nby the International Telecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU). The uplink peak\ndata rate is 10 Gbps, and the downlink peak data\
    \ rate is 20 Gbps per\nmobile station. Therefore, an IoT-enabled network is used\
    \ for the\nInternet of Things-based smart irrigation system, which allows for\n\
    remote monitoring of soil moisture and watering.\n3.3 Mobile application\nA mobile\
    \ application is accessed by farmers on farms. Using this\napplication, we can\
    \ make predictions utilizing insight data and the\ncollected cultivation insights\
    \ data (Dhanush et al., 2017; Hota et al.,\n2020; Maheswari et al., 2021). The\
    \ mobile application will provide\ncrop-relevant information like crop health\
    \ alerts, pest control, and\nwarehouse inventory managing warnings as shown below.\
    \ The key\nfeatures of mobile applications are as follows:\n•\nobserving yield\
    \ health facts (nutrient levels, pH levels, etc.)\nthrough the functionality of\
    \ yield inspection (Ahmadi et al.,\n2019),\n•\nthe application of organizing fertilizer\
    \ and insecticides for\nthe farm (Kiryushin, 2019),\n•\nautomating the irrigation\
    \ system and controlling water\nlevels as well as soil health over the farm (Al-Ali\
    \ et al.,\n2019; Li et al., 2020), and\n•\ntracing yield records and checking\
    \ warehouse details (bin\ninventories) (Quitaleg and Ortiz, 2020).\nFIGURE 1\n\
    Crop-related and supply prediction factors.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n05\n3.4 Impact of water quality on\
    \ tomato yield\nTomato yield is a broad view that encompasses the interactions\n\
    of various single-quality attributes. Irrigation water salinity\nenhanced tomato\
    \ amounts, fruit thickness, soluble solids, total\nacid, vitamin C, and the sugar–acid\
    \ ratio (Magán et al., 2008).\nFresh tomato yield, canopy diameter, fruit water\
    \ content,\ntomato ﬁrmness, and calcium and nitrogen concentrations\ndecreased\
    \ as water salinity levels increased, whereas increasing\nsalinity levels increased\
    \ texture strength (Shao et al., 2014). In\naddition, saline water irrigation\
    \ increased tomato fruit’s total\nsoluble solids and acidity (pH) by 11.1% and\
    \ 6.9%, respectively.\n3.5 Role of the contactless IR sensors for\ntomato crop\
    \ growth measurement\nThe contactless IR sensors are used to produce infrared\n\
    radiation to measure the plant’s growth from its stem, whereas\nthe radiation\
    \ is converted into some amount of electricity and is less\nthan 10 cm from the\
    \ target. In the proposed system, sensors are\nplaced more than 10 cm from the\
    \ plant, which will measure growth\nby using a method based on the speculation\
    \ of infrared energy. The\nIR sensors are ﬁtted with infrared ﬁlters to avoid\
    \ outside disturbing\nlight. IR sensors are ﬁtted to measure the thickness growth\
    \ of\ntomato crops through the analog output voltage. The energy\nradiations of\
    \ infrared sensors are transformed into distance data,\nwhich is not directly\
    \ propositional to distance data.\n4 Proposed system and methods\nThe evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) crop is described as the amount of\nwater necessary for the perfect growth\
    \ of various crops in\nconnection with the lack of water by evapotranspiration\
    \ which is\ndiscussed in this system. The demand for yielding waters refers to\n\
    an optimally developed harvest, so that a consistent, disease-free\ncrop is actively\
    \ cultivated and completely sheltered. An advanced\nnetwork can connect billions\
    \ of devices due to its increased\nbandwidth, in addition to its large data capacity\
    \ and speeds faster\nthan 10 Gbps. The download and upload speeds of smart networks\n\
    will be up to 100 times faster than those of 4G and 4G LTE\nnetworks. So, this\
    \ method is advantageous in addition to IoT\nmodules, which gives a perfect way\
    \ to produce tomatoes in the\nseasonal and non-seasonal periods. The cultivation\
    \ process is\nmainly inﬂuenced by the following situations like weather, yield\n\
    type, and development stage of the harvest, which is depicted in\nFigures 2, 3.\n\
    The proposed system is integrated with the following\ncomponents which are described\
    \ below:\ni. Arduino Uno microcontroller:\nIt is an open-source microcontroller\
    \ that can be programmed\nby writing C or C++ code to control the overall system\
    \ automation.\nAfter installing and programming the Arduino, it is ready to collect\n\
    the number of inputs from IR moisture soil sensors and also provide\na remote\
    \ command to control the irrigation system. However, this\nmicrocontroller remotely\
    \ controls the overall execution process.\nii. NIR-soil moisture sensor:\nSoil\
    \ moisture is a main attribute of soil and an important soil\nproperty that plays\
    \ a vital role in a variety of farming activities,\nhydrological processes, and\
    \ environmental concerns. A near-\ninfrared (NIR) reﬂectance sensor is created\
    \ for the calculation of\nmoisture levels in the soil by implementing two light-emitting\n\
    diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths: one with a wavelength of\n1,945 nm and\
    \ a strong water absorption band and the other with a\nwavelength of 1,850 nm\
    \ and a weak water absorption band. It is\nlinked to an Arduino controller to\
    \ record the moisture level of the\nsoil. Accordingly, it gives instructions to\
    \ the water controller for\nirrigation in the tomato cultivation land.\niii. Pinolex\
    \ drip automatic water controller:\nThe smart ﬂower irrigation timer is an efﬁcient\
    \ way to manage\nand control tomato crop irrigation needs. When you go on vacation\n\
    or anywhere, an automatic water timer is set by the Arduino\nmicrocontroller,\
    \ which is useful for watering tomato cultivation.\nIt ﬁts a 3/4-inch (19 mm)\
    \ thread tap. It can water the plants\nregularly, even when no one is at home,\
    \ and thus improve their\nsurvival rate.\niv. Wi-Fi access point:\nFIGURE 2\n\

    \ high-speed Ethernet wire links a router to an access point,\nwhich transforms\
    \ a connection-oriented signal into a\nconnectionless signal. Connectionless connectivity\
    \ is typically the\nonly available option for base stations, which use Wi-Fi to\
    \ establish\nlinks with destination devices. As a result, the Wi-Fi service is\
    \ linked\nto the 5G Internet, and it then provides a direct link with the end\n\
    user to remotely monitor and control automatic irrigation as well as\ntomato crop\
    \ cultivation.\n4.1 Working principle of the model\nThe purpose model generally\
    \ performs the operation in the\nfollowing steps:\nStep 1:\nFirst of all, the\
    \ NIR contactless sensor observes the moisture\nlevel of the soil. As a result,\
    \ it is connected near the tomato plant to\ncollect soil moisture. A ﬁeld’s soil\
    \ moisture status is critical for\nmaking planting, fertilizer application, and\
    \ irrigation decisions.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, the moisture levels are observed through\
    \ the Arduino\nUno module, which is also linked with a Wi-Fi access point to send\n\
    all the data to the mobile applications with the help of 5G\ntechnology. The 5G\
    \ network helps to gather the moisture levels\nthrough the cloud service and automatically\
    \ regulates the\nirrigation system.\nStep 3:\nWhen the moisture level is monitored\
    \ through the mobile app,\nthen the drip irrigation system is smartly controlled\
    \ through the\n5G-enabled IoT module (Arduino Uno microcontroller).\n4.2 Evaporation\
    \ and\ntranspiration processes\nEvaporation and transpiration happen at the same\
    \ time, and\nthere is no way to talk about them separately. The fraction of solar\n\
    radiation that reaches the cropped soil surface is used to calculate\nevaporation.\
    \ However, once the crop has matured to the point that\nit completely covers the\
    \ soil surface, transpiration becomes the ﬁrst\nprocess. IoT module sensors properly\
    \ calculate the moisture level of\nthe soil with the help of the calculation process\
    \ of ET.\nEvapotranspiration is commonly deﬁned in mm/time, and\nwater quantity\
    \ lost from a cropped plane is deﬁned in water\ndepth units. Because 2 hectares\
    \ has an area of 20,000 m2 and 2\nmm equals 0.002 m, a loss of 2 mm of water corresponds\
    \ to a loss of\n10 m3 of water per hectare. Finally, 2 mm day−1 corresponds to\
    \ 10\nm3 ha−1 day−l.\nThe quantity of energy received per unit area can also be\
    \ used to\ncharacterize water depths, with energy referring to the amount of\n\
    heat or energy required to evaporate free water. The latent heat of\nevaporation\
    \ (l) varies with the temperature of water. At 21°C, for\nexample, l is approximately\
    \ 2.50 MJ kg−1. To put it another way,\n2.50 MJ is required to evaporate 2 kg\
    \ or 0.002 m3 of water.\n4.3 Impact of weather on the yielding\nwater requires\
    \ reference crop\nevapotranspiration ETo\nThe main impact of weather information\
    \ on crop water\nrequirements is sunshine, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.\n\
    FIGURE 3\nTest scenario of the irrigation system.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nThe reference crop evapotranspiration\
    \ deﬁnes the evaporation energy\nof the atmosphere (ETo). Reference crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ also\nknown as reference evapotranspiration, is the evapotranspiration\nrate\
    \ from a reference surface that is not deﬁcient in water and is\nexpressed as\
    \ ETo.\nETo values measured in distinct locations or climates are\nequivalent\
    \ because they indicate identical reference surfaces.\nThese variables inﬂuencing\
    \ ETo can be parameters for climate,\nwhich can be measured using climate information.\
    \ ETo intimates at\na given location, the evaporating energy of the atmosphere.\n\
    In this research domain, different techniques are available for\ncalculating ETo.\
    \ It is tested either by an evapotranspiration pan or\ntheoretically by using\
    \ calculated weather information.\n4.3.1 Saucepan (pan) evaporation technique\n\
    The saucepan evaporation technique allows an environment to\nmonitor the combined\
    \ inﬂuence of temperature, moisture, wind\nspeed, and sunlight on the reference\
    \ yield evapotranspiration ETo.\nThe various evaporation pans are class A evaporation\
    \ pan and\nSunken Colorado pan. The evaporation saucepan is used in the\nfollowing\
    \ equation:\nETo = Kpan \x01 Epan\n(3)\nwhere Kpan is the pan coefﬁcient, Epan\
    \ is the pan evaporation,\nand ETo is the reference yield evapotranspiration.\n\
    4.3.2 Blaney–Criddle technique\nThe Blaney–Criddle method is a theoretical technique\
    \ to\ndetermine the reference yield evapotranspiration ETo, and more\nliterary\
    \ techniques have been used, but many of them were locally\ncalculated. If the\
    \ process is accessed locally, if it is available or if\nlocal procedures are\
    \ not available, then the theoretical method is\nused for the calculation.\nETo\
    \ = P(0:46Tmean + 8)\n(4)\nTmax = omonth(max)\nNdays=month\nTmin = omonth(min)\n\
    Ndays=month\nTmean = Tmax+Tmin\n2\n(5)\nWhere ETo = 1 month of average period,\n\
    Tmean = regular temperature, and\nP = regular proportion of yearly day time periods.\n\
    4.4 Impact of yield type on yield water\nrequires Kc\nThe single crop coefﬁcient\
    \ Kc plays a signiﬁcant role in crop\ncharacteristics as well as the averaged\
    \ effects of soil evaporation.\nAverage crop coefﬁcients are more relevant and\
    \ convenient than Kc\ncomputed on a daily time step using a separate crop and\
    \ soil\ncoefﬁcient for normal irrigation planning and management,\ndevelopment\
    \ of basic irrigation schedules, and most hydrologic\nwater balance studies (Farg\
    \ et al., 2012). The impact of yield type on\nthe yielding water requires dealing\
    \ with the yield type and the\ndevelopment yield stage on water needs. The ﬁeld\
    \ is harvested\nbetween the relationship of reference grown yield and grown yield.\n\
    ETY ield = ETo \x01 Kc\n(6)\nwhere ETYield = yield evapotranspiration process\
    \ (month/day),\nKc = yield inﬂuence, and ETo = reference evapotranspiration. Here,\n\
    ETYield and ETo are stated in equal units in month/day.\n4.4.1 Manipulation of\
    \ the overall growing stage\nFrom the beginning of transplantation to the last\
    \ day, the\noverall growing stage of the crop is determined. It is primarily\n\
    inﬂuenced by the following:\n•\nthe various harvest and its multiplicity,\n•\n\
    the condition of the weather, and\n•\nthe different stages of planting on the\
    \ ﬁeld.\n4.4.2 Manipulation of growth stages\nThe manipulation of the overall\
    \ growing stages of yield is\ndivided into four stages:\n•\nthe analysis of the\
    \ yield ﬁrst stage,\n•\nthe observation of the yield development stage in a ﬁeld,\n\
    •\nthe mid-time cultivation stage, and\n•\nthe late-time growth stage of the crop.\n\

    \ of the requirement of aquatic crops ETcrop is\nevaluated as:\nETcrop = ETo \x01\

    \ the complete growing\ntime of tomato crop, which is 638 mm.\n5 Simulation setup\
    \ and results analysis\nIn the proposed system, the related experimental data\
    \ are received\nthrough the installed soil moisture and humidity sensor from the\n\
    tomato crop ﬁeld. The NIR REES52 Soil Sensor is used to collect the\npercentage\
    \ of moisture in the soil. Based on this,an irrigation process is\nautomated with\
    \ a developed mobile application which is depicted in\nFigure 4. By using this\
    \ app, the status of soil moisture and the growth of\nplants can be dynamically\
    \ observed, and the irrigation method can also\nbe controlled. Similarly, the\
    \ plant growth parameters like maximum\nheight, width, and diameter of the stem\
    \ of the tomato plant are\nmeasured using an infrared sensor. This is tested in\
    \ a regional area\n28 m in length and 7 m in width, but the experimental site\
    \ is portioned\ninto two rows, and tomatoes are planted 4 m in length and 1.2\
    \ m in\nwidth zone. On the other hand, 50-cm-high PVC plates are applied for\n\
    separation from communities, and a 50-cm row spacing is followed for\nthe plantation\
    \ of tomatoes. Data are captured continuously from the\nﬁeld of cultivation. The\
    \ fog nodes are implemented for sensing data in\nthe area of cultivation. The\
    \ overall implementation of the proposed\nwork is depicted in Figure 5.\nThe cultivation\
    \ time to the collection period is from 1\nNovember 2020 to 18 April 2021, as\
    \ depicted in Figure 6, but it is\ndrawn from the above data (Table 4), which\
    \ is deﬁned in step 5. The\ncultivation of the tomato growth period is evaluated\
    \ as the crop\nsowing period to seedling period (November 1 to December 5), the\n\
    development stage of the crop period (December 6 to January 15),\nthe mid-time\
    \ stage (ﬂowering) of the growth period (January 16 to\nFebruary 5), and the late-time\
    \ stage of growth (fruiting and mature\npicking) period (February 6 to March 30).\
    \ The analysis of irrigation\ndata for tomato cropping depends on the relevant\
    \ factor of the soil\nmoisture sensor at 22 cm depth. This measure predicts the\
    \ volume\nof irrigation.\nBy the observation of moisture level from the above,\
    \ Table 5\nshows a dynamic way of the automatic required level of irrigation\n\
    for tomato cultivation (Figure 7).\nTable 6 shows a feature-wise comparison of\
    \ this paper with the\nexisting literature. The existing work has been mostly\
    \ considered\nunder normal cultivation methods. However, in the proposed work,\n\
    it is found that 5G technology is integrated with the IoT module. As\na result,\
    \ the irrigation system is working intelligently for\nthe cultivation.\nIn Table\
    \ 7, we can see how the 5G network stacks up against\nother existing network generations.\
    \ High-deﬁnition video streaming\nand telephony were made possible on the road\
    \ by 4G networks, an\nimprovement above 3G. As network trafﬁc has increased, the\n\
    theoretical maximum for 4G speeds has been reached. According\nto the ITU, the\
    \ most recent 5G use cases fall into one of three\ncategories: ultrareliable low\
    \ latency communications (URLLC),\nmassive machine type communications (mMTC),\
    \ and enhanced\nmobile broadband (eMBB).\nTable 8 shows that Odisha is in the\
    \ ﬁfth position all over India.\nThis table shows only the seasonal production\
    \ of tomatoes in India.\nIf the display of tomatoes is required to produce in\
    \ non-seasonal\nduration (August to October), then the state Odisha is considered\
    \ in\nthe third position. The implementation of the intelligent cultivation\n\
    method improves the situation in the production table.\nTable 9 shows the exportation\
    \ of tomatoes from India to other\ncountries. The export is done in the seasonal\
    \ duration of\nproduction, but it is required to export in a non-seasonal period\n\
    through intelligent irrigation techniques. Table 10 shows the\nimportation of\
    \ tomatoes to India in the case of seasonal duration.\nThe IoT-based intelligent\
    \ irrigation method provides a technique to\ncultivate tomatoes in the non-seasonal\
    \ period, so that there is no\nneed to import from outside of the country, which\
    \ gives better\nperformance than the traditional cultivation process.\n6 Conclusion\
    \ with future work\nIn this approach, traditional ﬁelds such as agriculture require\n\
    technology (here, smart farming) to achieve higher crop yields with\nless human\
    \ intervention in a limited time frame. Smart farming, on\nthe other hand, necessitates\
    \ signiﬁcant investment, improved\ncoverage and connectivity, and more bandwidth\

    \ capability of 5G with low delay, high density, and large\nbandwidth provides\
    \ a communication guarantee for the application of other information\ntechnologies\
    \ in the smart agricultural Internet of Things. Smart agriculture has relied on\
    \ the\nﬁfth generation of information technology 5G, the Internet of Things, robotics,\
    \ drones, big\ndata, AI, machine learning, blockchain, and other key technologies\
    \ to transform modern\nagriculture. It realizes the deep integration of the physical\
    \ world and the information\nworld, changing the current mode of agricultural\
    \ production. Industry-oriented universal\nwide-area Internet of Things is becoming\
    \ the main force [9]. It can promote the expansion\nand upgrading of IoTs in smart\
    \ agriculture and expedite the landing application of big data\nin smart agriculture.\
    \ It is the key to the in-depth application of UAV in agriculture and is\nan important\
    \ booster for integrating artiﬁcial intelligence and robot blockchain in smart\n\
    agriculture [10].\nThe Internet of Things continues to evolve with the evolution\
    \ of information technol-\nogy and sensors. It should not only perceive and transmit\
    \ data but also have functions such\nas recognition, computation, service, semantics,\
    \ and even cognitive decision-making [11].\nThe detection, management, and maintenance\
    \ functions of the Internet of Things will\nalso gradually become intelligent\
    \ and unmanned. The in-depth integration of the Inter-\nnet of Things, big data,\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence will revolutionize the current form of\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2336\n5 of 46\nthe Internet of Things and generate huge social value\
    \ [12]. As an important part of new\ndigital infrastructure, the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) is deeply integrated with 5G, big data,\ncloud computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ blockchain, digital twin, and other technologies,\nand is evolving into a smart\
    \ IoT system (IoTs 2.0) [13], which is profoundly changing\nthe process of the\
    \ modern agricultural industry and promoting the rapid development of\nsmart agriculture.\n\
    In the ﬁeld of smart agriculture, the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) is\
    \ devel-\noping rapidly, but still faces many challenges. This includes the new\
    \ application of the\nagricultural scene, the transformation of the new agricultural\
    \ production mode, and the\ndeep integration with other technologies. As a basic\
    \ condition for the in-depth application\nof the agricultural Internet of Things,\
    \ 5G communication technology will promote the\nin-depth application of the agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things in smart agriculture. 5G can\nprovide MTC communication with\
    \ high reliability, low delay, and wide coverage, and its\nthree typical application\
    \ scenarios have broad prospects in smart agriculture [14]. 5G IoT\ntechnology\
    \ can be extended to the scope of current, which cannot be achieved with the\n\
    ﬁeld, making IoT depth perception of the intelligent environment perception, enlarging\n\
    the coverage of the Internet of Things of agriculture and the ascending scale,\
    \ expanding\nthe communication capacity, and realizing large-scale equipment interact\
    \ with each other\nand data sharing so as to realize the agricultural decision-making\
    \ process depth [15]. 5G-\nIoT is expected to provide real-time, on-demand, online,\
    \ reconﬁgurable, and end-to-end\ncoordinated capabilities for a variety of agricultural\
    \ applications. It can provide logically\nindependent network applications and\
    \ conﬁgure networks on demand. According to the\nfuture agricultural needs, the\
    \ integration of 5G with smart agriculture and the Internet of\nThings will be\
    \ able to achieve network characteristics, as shown in Figure 5.\nof the modern\

    \ of agricultural IoT for smart agriculture.\nIt needs a depth perception of the\
    \ agricultural production process. Large-scale agricultural\nproduction scenarios\
    \ require large-scale sensing nodes to transmit data [56]. Traditional\nsensor\
    \ networks have some difﬁculties in networking reliability, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ and\ndeployment cost. However, large-scale machine-type communication based\
    \ on 5G can\nachieve a smart agricultural IoT with low cost, high reliability,\
    \ low power consumption,\nand convenient networking and deployment. For example,\
    \ NB-IoT can be deployed to\nquickly monitor soil, fertilizer, and plants in farmland.\
    \ In this way, the comprehensive\nperception and depth perception of agricultural\
    \ production can be realized, providing\nsupport for the deepening application\
    \ of smart agriculture [57].\n5G-oriented NB-IoT enables dense sensing network\
    \ deployment. Combining com-\nputer vision and other technologies can effectively\
    \ extract plant phenotypic variation\nand its related information. Moreover, machine\
    \ learning, artiﬁcial intelligence, and other\ncutting-edge technologies are used\
    \ for processing [58]. Deep learning convolutional neural\nnetworks were used\
    \ to evaluate crop phenotypic characteristics and soil conditions. Multi-\nspectral\
    \ imaging in agricultural areas is based on IoT sensors and small unmanned aerial\n\
    vehicles (UAVs). It identiﬁes plant quality and leaf diseases.\n2.2.3. Ultra-Reliable\
    \ Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) in Smart Agricultural IoT\nSuch ultra-reliable\
    \ low-latency communication applications are generally oriented to\nmission-critical,\
    \ real-time transmission of critical data and control of major agricultural\n\
    equipment [59]. Drones based on 5G networks can achieve precision operations.\
    \ The\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n12 of 46\nﬂight trajectory and situation data\
    \ of the UAV can be returned to the 5G network UAV\nmanagement and operation platform\
    \ in real-time through the 5G network. Flight status can\nbe monitored in real-time\
    \ [60]. Through the agricultural information collected by UAV and\nsatellite remote\
    \ sensing technology, the platform can intelligently and dynamically analyze\n\
    the crop situation in the monitoring region, make a macroscopic estimation of\
    \ the real-time\nseedling situation, environmental dynamics and distribution of\
    \ crops, and output scientiﬁc\nreports [61]. According to the report, farmers\
    \ can clearly grasp the growth situation of\ncrops and soil moisture and manage\
    \ production in response to problems so as to ensure\nmore scientiﬁc and efﬁcient\
    \ farming activities.\nThe universal application of 5G will provide the communication\
    \ basis for unmanned,\nintelligent, and intelligent agricultural machinery and\
    \ equipment because 5G technology\nhas the characteristics of high speed, short\
    \ delay, low power consumption, ubiquitous\nnetwork, and scalability. It will\
    \ shine in the ﬁelds of agricultural Internet of Things,\nprecision planting,\
    \ agricultural products circulation traceability, agricultural drones, smart\n\
    farming, agricultural industry services, and so on, and promote agriculture to\
    \ be more\ninformationalized and intelligent [62,63].\n2.3. Future Trends and\
    \ Key Technologies of 5G-IoT Application in Smart Agriculture\nIt can be seen\
    \ from the above analysis that the integration of 5G and IoT has a wide\napplication\
    \ prospect in the scenario of smart agriculture. Agricultural IoT can be used\
    \ to\ncollect environmental monitoring information on crop growth and process\
    \ this information\nto develop the production plan of precision agriculture. Precision\
    \ agriculture requires\nthe network to support the connection of massive devices\
    \ and a large number of small\ndata packets. Since agricultural IoT devices are\
    \ often deployed in areas where signals are\nchallenging to reach, such as mountains,\
    \ forests, and waters, 5G can meet the requirements\nwith stronger coverage capability,\
    \ ﬂexibility, scalability, and lower power consumption,\ndelay, and cost. The\
    \ future trends of intelligent agricultural IoT facing 5G mainly reﬂect\nthe following:\n\
    1.\nCloud edge collaboration: agricultural monitoring terminal and cloud collaboration.\n\
    2.\nCloud computing/AI/big data/Internet of Things/digital twin and other agricul-\n\
    tural integration.\n3.\nVirtualization and servitization of perception/access/communication\
    \ layer, software\ndeﬁned network.\n4.\nModel-driven, cloud-native new application\
    \ (APP) development environment for\nsmart Internet of Things.\n5.\nThe deep integration\
    \ of people, information space, and physical space will form\na deep intelligent\
    \ smart agriculture and achieve a harmonious ecology of human–\nmachine symbiosis.\n\
    The key technologies of IoT applications in smart agriculture include vital informa-\n\
    tion sensor technology, phenotype information acquisition technology, phenotype\
    \ group\ndata analysis technology, phenotype group big data management and database\
    \ building\ntechnology, etc. [64,65]. All these technologies need the support\
    \ of 5G. Among them,\nthe life information sensor technology collects information\
    \ about seeds and their propa-\ngation/seed production environment and obtains\
    \ the corresponding physiological and\necological information through signal transformation\
    \ and AI data processing. Phenotypic\ninformation acquisition technology automatically\
    \ extracts important phenotypic features\nand logical relationships from massive\
    \ amounts of information to realize automatic and\naccurate identiﬁcation of phenotypic\
    \ traits. Phenotypic data analysis technology covers the\ncomplete process from\
    \ the initial data collection to the ﬁnal reﬁnement analysis. Phenotype\ngroup\
    \ big data management and database building technology are used to manage, store,\n\
    and share tabular data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n13 of 46\n3. Evolution of\
    \ Intelligent Agricultural IoT 2.0 for 5G\nIntelligent Internet of Things (IoT\
    \ 2.0) refers to a complex system that integrates “hu-\nman, information space\
    \ and physical space” [66] under the guidance of 5G and other\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and AI technologies and intelligently interconnects and serves\ncooperatively.\
    \ Among them, the new generation of AI technologies includes data-driven\ndeep\
    \ reinforcement learning intelligence, network-based swarm intelligence, hybrid\
    \ in-\ntelligence oriented by human–machine and brain–computer interaction technology,\
    \ cross-\nmedia inference intelligence, autonomous intelligent system, etc. The\
    \ “wisdom” of the\nsmart IoT system refers to the interconnection of people, information\
    \ space and physi-\ncal space, and the digitalization, IoT, servitization (cloud),\
    \ collaboration, customization,\nﬂexibility, greenness, and intelligence of the\
    \ layered and progressive system [67].\nThe Internet of Things is evolving into\
    \ the next generation. Under the role of 5G, the\nInternet of Things combined\
    \ with big data, machine learning, cloud services, and so on, will\nhave intelligent\
    \ characteristics. It can make the physical process and the information world\n\
    deep integration. The network level of the Internet of Things mainly includes\
    \ monitoring,\ndetection, computing, service, and control from bottom to top,\
    \ and these connotations will\nalso undergo profound changes.\n3.1. 5G Smart Agricultural\
    \ IoT 2.0 Architecture\nWith the rapid development of video business and various\
    \ vertical business applica-\ntions in smart agriculture, centralized data storage\
    \ and processing modes will face difﬁcult\nbottlenecks and pressures. The existing\
    \ Internet of Things architecture is difﬁcult to meet\nthe data return of big\
    \ data, which easily deteriorates network indicators and affects user\nexperience.\
    \ In this case, data processing capabilities and services need to be provided\n\
    near the edge of the network where the data are generated. With the development\
    \ of\n5G and the availability of relevant business requirements and network conditions,\
    \ edge\ncomputing has gradually achieved great development. Agricultural IoT is\
    \ evolving to\nSmart Agricultural IoT 2.0, where edge computing can alleviate\
    \ these defects of centralized\nIoT, and transfer computing tasks to the edge\
    \ service side to signiﬁcantly improve delay\nand energy consumption, especially\
    \ for delay and energy-sensitive IoT applications.\n5G IoT for smart agriculture\
    \ achieves optimal resource allocation through network\nslicing, SDN/VFN, and\
    \ other technologies. However, due to a large amount of sensing\ndata in the smart\
    \ agriculture scene, the real-time requirement is high. With the increase in\n\
    terminal computing power, the network architecture for smart agriculture will\
    \ also change.\nThe architecture of a smart IoT system is shown in Figure 11.\n\
    5G-based agricultural IoT can be implemented by deploying edge computing based\
    \ on\napplication needs. Edge computing migrates IT resources, such as computing\
    \ and storage,\nfrom traditional cloud data centers to users. IT shortens the\
    \ physical distance between\nusers and IT resources, achieves lower data interaction\
    \ delay, and saves network trafﬁc.\nThis provides users with low latency and high\
    \ stability of IT solutions. Edge computation\ndepends on edge nodes. The requirements\
    \ of edge nodes for smart agricultural IoT are\nnot strictly regulated. Compared\
    \ with the general sensor node thought and its computing\npower, the communication\
    \ ability is stronger. The deployment position is usually at the\nend of the network,\
    \ that is, the application site. After IoT edge applications are deployed,\nedge\
    \ nodes serve as extensions of remote IoT platforms on devices. Devices are managed\n\
    through cloud-edge collaboration. Edge nodes can provide computing and management\n\
    services for nearby devices, such as local management of low-latency services,\
    \ local control,\nand rule execution when disconnected from the cloud. The device\
    \ accesses the edge node\nand ﬁnally uploads data to the remote IoT platform through\
    \ the edge node, as shown in\nFigure 12.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n14 of 46\n\

    \ \n5G IoT for smart agriculture achieves optimal resource allocation through\

    \ Monitoring Terminals\nA large number of sensing devices will be deployed in\
    \ the smart agricultural IoT for\nbreeding moisture monitoring, ﬁne agriculture,\

    \ wide area networks [85] is a challenging problem.\nWith the continuous improvement\
    \ of the capabilities of the air interface at the access end,\nthe performance\

    end, and other areas. Therefore, there must also be corresponding innovative technologies\n\
    at the core or edge end to meet the nearly demanding requirements of 5G IoT applications\n\
    in the future [86]. However, the existing cellular network core architecture is\
    \ not suitable\nfor the development of the Internet of Things.\nThe deployment\

    \ When the sensing data are rich enough, the\ncomplex event rules can be established\
    \ through various moisture data and crop growth\nmodels to determine whether drip\
    \ irrigation and fertilization are needed [88,89]. In ﬁsh\nfarming, data collected\
    \ by various sensor devices deployed in ponds are used to determine\nwhether there\
    \ is a lack of oxygen or other complex events, and so on.\nThe detection conditions\
    \ of complex events ﬁrstly need rich physical world data, and\nenough sensing\
    \ devices need to be deployed so that various relationships can be discovered.\n\
    Second, complex computational processing power is required. For pattern matching\
    \ and\nso on, we need quick calculation and judgment. In addition, some complex\
    \ event detection\nis real-time, and these requirements become feasible with 5G.\n\
    3.3.2. Depth Detection of Pests and Diseases Based on Machine Learning\nWith the\
    \ development of information technology, methods based on machine learning\nhave\
    \ been widely used in agricultural production in recent years. Many scholars combine\n\
    image processing with pattern recognition, and widely use it in crop disease and\
    \ pest\nrecognition. The color, shape, texture, and other parameters extracted\
    \ were screened and\noptimized. The linear classiﬁer, Bayesian decision theory,\
    \ fuzzy recognition, and other\npattern recognition techniques were used to identify\
    \ and classify various crop pests and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n22 of 46\n\
    diseases, which improved the recognition accuracy. Thus, the development of agricultural\n\
    informatization and precision was further promoted [90].\nAs an important branch\
    \ of machine learning, deep learning network is becoming\na hot technology with\
    \ its powerful data analysis ability. Deep learning networks can\ncontain hundreds\
    \ of hidden layers, and the features will be transformed a lot of times.\nDeep\
    \ learning can be applied to identify crop pests and disease targets. For achieving\n\
    the relationship ﬁtting of complex sample data, the core idea is not only to automatically\n\
    extract multi-layer feature representations from a large amount of data through\
    \ a variety of\nlinear and nonlinear transformations but also to complete the\
    \ task of feature extraction and\ntransformation using supervised and unsupervised\
    \ combined training methods [91]. Due\nto the structure of a deep neural network,\
    \ the error features extracted by the previous layer\nnetwork can be weakened\
    \ to a certain extent, and the complex function can be expressed\nwith fewer parameters.\
    \ The structure of the deep neural network will be more compact,\nwhich improves\
    \ the efﬁciency and performance of the network.\nIt is obvious that the current\
    \ methods with strong pattern recognition ability are\nparticularly dependent\
    \ on a large amount of data, which requires enough data to draw\nuseful conclusions.\
    \ The traditional agricultural IoT data are limited, which is challenging to\n\
    support the data collection needs of future smart agriculture development. The\
    \ introduction\nof 5G and smart agricultural IoT provides conditions for the collection\
    \ of massive data.\n3.4. Cloud Edge Fog Computing Fusion in 5G Intelligent Agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things\nIn future smart agricultural IoT, data will be extremely\
    \ abundant, and how to conduct\nanalysis and calculation from these data to guide\
    \ modern agricultural production is an\nimportant challenge.\nDue to the limitations\
    \ of volume and battery life, many mobile devices deployed in\nagricultural production\
    \ cannot meet the requirements of these applications in terms of\ncomputing, storage,\
    \ energy, and other resources. Therefore, Mobile Cloud Computing\n(MCC) technology\
    \ has been proposed. It provides reorganized computing resources for\nmobile devices\
    \ in the cloud platform, migrates data processing and storage to the cloud,\n\
    and reduces constraints on its own resources. With the development of smart agriculture,\n\
    massive data will be generated in the future to be analyzed, processed, and stored\
    \ in the\ncentral cloud [92]. At the same time, there may be a large number of\
    \ connections between\nsensing devices, and these MCCS cannot meet the demand.\
    \ New computing methods, such\nas edge computing and fog computing, will be integrated\
    \ into the intelligent agricultural\nIoT system [93]. Edge sensors no longer need\
    \ to continuously transmit various sensing\ndata to the data center. It can judge\
    \ the sensing data on its own, contacting the data center\nonly when there is\
    \ a signiﬁcant change in the reading to decide what action to take. Cloud\ncomputing\
    \ is suitable for non-real-time, long-period data, and business decision scenarios,\n\
    while edge computing plays an irreplaceable role in real-time, short-period data,\
    \ and local\ndecision-making. Edge computing and cloud computing are two important\
    \ supports for\nthe digital transformation of the industry. Their collaboration\
    \ in the network, business,\napplication, intelligence, and other aspects will\
    \ help support the agricultural IoT to create\ngreater value. Intelligent edge\
    \ computing based on 5G power can use the cloud for large-\nscale security conﬁguration,\
    \ deployment, the management of edge devices, and the ability\nto assign intelligence\
    \ based on device type and scenario, allowing intelligence to ﬂow\nbetween the\
    \ cloud and the edge. The edge computing model in smart agriculture is shown\n\
    in Figure 22.\nSecondly, with the continuous enrichment of data in smart agricultural\
    \ IoT, the tra-\nditional forms of computing will become richer and richer. Distributed\
    \ computing based\non cloud computing, fog computing, and other forms will be\
    \ deeply integrated with 5G\ncommunication capabilities and applied to smart agriculture.\

    \ aquaculture, animal husbandry,\nand aquaculture, the scene such as plant monitoring,\

    \ Agricultural IoT Application Paradigm under 5G\n4.1. Typical Application Scenarios\
    \ of 5G Smart Agricultural IoT\nThe development of 5G network will provide the\
    \ infrastructure needed for smart\nagriculture for agricultural production. The\
    \ main application scenarios include the follow-\ning aspects.\n4.1.1. Smart Farm\n\
    The two characteristics of 5G network, high speed and large connection, will help\n\
    the agricultural industry implement large-scale machine services. Centralized\
    \ control\nof environmental sensors, planters, UAVs, and other monitoring equipment\
    \ and real-\ntime data transmission. Finally, the purpose of intensive farming,\
    \ accurate fertilization,\nand reasonable irrigation is achieved [97]. Agricultural\
    \ machinery automatic agricultural\nmachinery equipment based on 5G was integrated\
    \ to achieve rapid, large-area, efﬁcient,\nand precise spraying operation [98].\n\
    4.1.2. Smart Forestry\nSmart forestry utilizes 5G network video, UAV, and other\
    \ monitoring equipment to\ncarry out forest inspection, realize the monitoring\
    \ of forest resources, forest pests and\ndiseases, wild animals and plants, forest\
    \ ﬁre prevention, and provide guide and rescue\nservices for staff and tourists\
    \ [99].\n4.1.3. Intelligent Animal Husbandry\n5G intelligent animal husbandry\
    \ can improve the production efﬁciency of animal\nhusbandry, reduce the cost of\
    \ breeding, prevent livestock epidemic and livestock loss, and\nprotect animal\
    \ husbandry ecology [100,101]. For example, the use of 5G drone technology,\n\
    wearing 5G terminals on the necks of cows, and the use of Internet of Things technology\
    \ to\nmanage yaks have brought great changes to the traditional herding work of\
    \ plateau herders.\n4.1.4. Smart Fishing Ground\n5G smart ﬁshing grounds use monitoring\
    \ equipment such as high-deﬁnition net-\nwork cameras and underwater camera systems\
    \ to carry out real-scene monitoring, aquatic\nproduct growth monitoring, and\
    \ precise bait casting to improve the safety of underwater\noperations and save\
    \ labor costs [102]. In the Marine ranch, 5G panoramic monitoring appli-\ncation\
    \ is realized through 5G coverage. The panoramic high-deﬁnition camera equipment\n\
    and 5G underwater camera system were set up to realize the 24-h panoramic monitoring\
    \ of\nthe ranch. Managers can observe the growth of aquatic products, including\
    \ underwater\nobservation, from their ofﬁces or homes through mobile phones [103].\
    \ Based on 5G technol-\nogy, the intelligent control of the production process\
    \ of Marine cash crops, including kelp\nand other seedlings, can also be realized,\
    \ making it possible to have unmanned Marine\nranching.\n4.2. Deep Sense of 5G\

    of low latency is that route decisions can be made in time, increasing the speed\

    30 of 46\nUnder the background of 5G, the smart agricultural IoT will transform\
    \ the existing\nagricultural machinery equipment and make it more intelligent.\
    \ Intelligent agricultural\nmachinery can perceive its position, surrounding environment\
    \ relationship, and the inter-\nnal working state of machinery by building machine\
    \ vision, multi-dimensional perception,\nand satellite positioning based on 5G\
    \ agricultural Internet of Things. It can achieve good\ncooperation and scientiﬁc\
    \ implementation, effectively improving the effect of agricultural\nmechanization\
    \ by controlling and operating each process. Intelligent agricultural machin-\n\
    ery 5G-based agricultural Internet of Things can realize real-time monitoring\
    \ of agricultural\nmachinery’s own condition, operating state of machinery and\
    \ tools, meteorological condi-\ntions, and operating environment. It can also\
    \ guide agricultural machinery to adjust the\noperation plan in time according\
    \ to the obtained information and effectively reduce the\nindustrial machinery\
    \ in the process of operation failure, such as machine damage, poor\nquality,\
    \ and other problems. In addition to the above, intelligent agricultural machinery\n\
    will reduce the amount of ineffective operation of industrial machinery. Energy\
    \ efﬁciency\nhas been signiﬁcantly improved. The precise operation also realizes\
    \ the precise applica-\ntion of pesticides and fertilizers and truly realizes\
    \ the requirements of energy-saving and\nenvironmental protection.\nIt is clear\
    \ that smart agriculture combined with the Internet of Things and machine\nlearning\
    \ algorithm big data can transform traditional agricultural machinery and equip-\n\
    ment, making them more intelligent. In addition, the operation of intelligent\
    \ detection\nand sensing equipment can realize the functions of agricultural machinery\
    \ positioning,\nreal-time statistics of agricultural machinery working area, and\
    \ real-time calculation of\noperation quality. The system supports a variety of\
    \ agricultural machinery operations such\nas sowing, transplanting, plant protection,\
    \ harvesting, deep loosening, and land prepara-\ntion, straw returning, and so\
    \ on. It can measure fuel consumption and obtain the working\ncondition information\
    \ of agricultural machinery in real-time. This facilitates the control\nof agricultural\
    \ production progress and facilitates the real-time control of the working\narea,\
    \ working quality, and working power consumption. Being based on geospatial remote\n\
    sensing technology, multi-sensor fusion technology, 5G technology, and big data\
    \ technology,\nthe system realizes the comprehensive upgrading of smart agricultural\
    \ machinery.\n4.3.2. Automatic Driving of Agricultural Machinery\nThe automatic\
    \ driving technology of agricultural machinery is to use high-precision\nsatellite\
    \ positioning and navigation information and controls the hydraulic system of\n\
    agricultural machinery by the controller so that the agricultural machinery can\
    \ drive\nautomatically according to the set route (straight line or curve). It\
    \ can effectively improve\nthe working accuracy, improve the land utilization\
    \ rate, reduce the labor intensity of\nmachine hands, and extend the working time\
    \ (ﬁeld work can also be carried out at night).\nMoreover, it is easy to operate\
    \ and reduces the requirement for the driving ability of the\nmanipulator [121,122].\
    \ Based on the Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) [123,124], a\nglobal Positioning\
    \ system (GPS) can achieve intelligent driving of all kinds of agricultural\n\
    machinery, including rice transplanters, seed drills, combine harvesters, etc.\
    \ The high-\nprecision positioning and navigation technology, image recognition,\
    \ and transmission\ntechnology are applied to the intelligent driving of these\
    \ machines to realize the precise\nnavigation of agricultural machinery driving\
    \ and automatically complete the land tillage,\nsowing, ﬁeld management, and harvest,\
    \ as shown in Figure 32.\nIntelligent agricultural machinery automatic driving\
    \ system uses satellite positioning,\nmechanical control, inertial navigation,\
    \ and other technologies so that agricultural machin-\nery, according to the planned\
    \ route, automatically adjusts the direction of travel. Operation\nprecision can\

    \ agricultural information such as \ncrop growth, pests, and diseases in different\
    \ operating areas were obtained by aerial re-\nmote sensing technology, and prescription\
    \ maps were generated to determine the pesti-\ncide preparations and dosage required\
    \ for aerial spraying in different areas. The precision \napplication of plant\

    \ to consume \nmore abundant information to meet its control needs. Secondly,\

    \ \nAgricultural products have various production processes, long cycles, and\
    \ numerous \nfactors, so it is challenging to realize standardized production\
    \ and management [130]. The \nsupply chain of agricultural products is in all\
    \ stages of agriculture before, during, and \nafter production. Participants participate\
    \ in different roles of producers and consumers to \nrealize the supply and circulation\
    \ of agricultural products among agricultural producers, \nagricultural materials/agricultural\
    \ service enterprises, wholesale and retail markets, reg-\nulatory agencies, and\
    \ end consumers. It connects the production, processing, transporta-\ntion, sales,\
    \ and other links of agricultural products and integrates logistics, capital flow,\
    \ \nand information flow. It is important to establish a chain structure network\
    \ composed of \nagricultural product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers,\
    \ and end consumers \n[131]. Traditional agricultural supply chain participants\
    \ mainly use the Internet of Things \ntechnology to achieve information collection,\
    \ transmission, processing, processing, and \nother businesses. However, as IoT\
    \ systems are built in different participant systems, they \nbelong to different\
    \ platforms. For the seemingly interconnected network, the business is \nFigure\

    \ which cannot adapt to multiple\ntypes of complex operations in the ﬁeld.\nSecond,\
    \ it is difﬁcult to control. Most of the intelligence degree is low, and anti-collision\n\
    and other functions are lacking.\nThird, the precision application control technology\

    \ is necessary to consume more\nabundant information to meet its control needs.\

    \ smart agriculture Internet of Things.\nThese new problems bring new challenges\
    \ to the application of smart agriculture.\nMany of these key issues may be partially\
    \ solved with the introduction of 5G technology.\n5G is the infrastructure of\
    \ the intelligent era. Its characteristics of “extremely high\nspeed, enormous\
    \ capacity and extremely low delay” can provide basic support for meeting\nthe\
    \ development needs of smart agriculture in the future. Compared with the 2–4G\
    \ era,\nthe demand for base stations and network control equipment has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nin 5G. The large-scale application of 5G technology not only increases\
    \ the cost of network\ninfrastructure, but also the cost of power and operation,\
    \ and maintenance is much higher\nthan that of 4G, which brings challenges to\
    \ the ﬁeld agricultural production with low added\nvalue. However, 5G technology\
    \ still has limits when it comes to applications such as virtual\nreality, intelligent\
    \ production, and driverless driving. First, the deployment of 5G base\nstations\
    \ is not balanced. As many 5G base stations are distributed in sparsely populated\n\
    areas, such as ﬁelds, agriculture, and farming, there may be only a few 5G base\
    \ stations\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n35 of 46\nin these areas, which cannot\
    \ effectively cover all of them, which brings challenges to the\npopularization\
    \ and application. Secondly, the introduction of 5G will bring a change of the\n\
    whole smart agriculture application paradigm. The architecture, perception, transmission,\n\
    computing, service, processing, and application mode of 5G Internet of Things\
    \ for smart\nagriculture will bring changes, and there will be challenges.\n5.1.\
    \ Fusion and Optimization of Sparse 5G Base Station and Heterogeneous Sensing\
    \ Network in\nSmart Agriculture\n5.1.1. Optimization of Hybrid Deployment of 5G\
    \ and Sensing Network\nAccording to the analysis, the characteristics of 5G network\
    \ in agriculture are sparse,\nuneven, and they have low coverage of network base\
    \ stations and slow deployment of\nfarm base stations in remote areas. This brings\
    \ challenges for the application of 5G in ﬁeld\nagriculture and plantation agriculture.\n\
    For this imbalance and sparsity feature, it can be conﬁgured from two aspects.\
    \ One is\nto optimize the deployment of sensing nodes, and the other is to deploy\
    \ in combination\nwith heterogeneous networks. The hybrid deployment strategy\
    \ for ﬁeld agriculture, for ex-\nample, 5G sensing nodes are deployed in key areas,\
    \ and other sensing nodes are deployed\nin other areas, and sensing deployment\
    \ optimization is realized through network resource\nvirtualization and other\
    \ technologies. When the communication nodes of large-scale in-\ntelligent agricultural\
    \ sensor networks are deployed in three-dimensional space under the\nbackground\
    \ of 5G, the traditional random node deployment mode has the problems of high\n\
    energy consumption, high cost, and node disconnection. Firstly, by taking advantage\
    \ of the\ncharacteristics of the high bandwidth of 5G communication, a hierarchical\
    \ communication\nscheme can be designed, and a hierarchical node optimal deployment\
    \ model, a communi-\ncation energy consumption model, and a fully connected sensor\
    \ information transmission\nnetwork model are established. On the premise of ensuring\
    \ the full connectivity of sensor\ncommunication network nodes in farmland, the\
    \ life cycle of communication network nodes\nis improved.\n(a) 5G sparse deployment\
    \ based on ﬁeld agricultural planting scenarios.\nCombined with the actual ﬁeld\
    \ agricultural planting scene, the 5G base station has a\nhigh working frequency\
    \ band and a large signal attenuation, and its coverage radius is only\n0.3–0.5\
    \ times that of the 4G base station. It is difﬁcult to meet the goal of low cost\
    \ and high\nbeneﬁt of network construction only by deploying a macro base station.\
    \ The micro-base\nstation has a small coverage radius and low construction cost.\
    \ In order to optimize the\ndeployment cost of 5G base stations, the heterogeneous\
    \ network architecture of “macro\nand micro collaboration” can be adopted. How\
    \ to combine smart agricultural business for\noptimal deployment is an important\
    \ issue. Heterogeneous networks can optimize the cost\nof 5G signal deployment\
    \ while realizing the coverage of agricultural operation areas and\noptimizing\
    \ the perceived cost.\n(b) Intensive deployment optimization of 5G and sensing\
    \ nodes in ﬁne agriculture.\nIn ﬁne agriculture, there are many parameters to\
    \ monitor, many types of business, and\nthe need for intensive sensing equipment,\
    \ which generates an explosion of mobile data.\nHow to realize intelligent and\
    \ efﬁcient green deployment planning of intelligent nodes such\nas base stations\
    \ and gateways with large area coverage for various intelligent agricultural\n\
    applications is one of the key issues. By deploying small base stations with lower\
    \ cost\nand closer to users, it becomes a feasible solution to construct ultra-dense\
    \ heterogeneous\nnetworks centered on monitoring objects.\n5.1.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G and Sensing Network Gateway Deployment\nPreviously, the deployment optimization\
    \ of sensing nodes and 5G base stations were\nproposed in ﬁne agriculture. In\
    \ the integration of 5G and sensing devices in deployment, it\nis necessary to\
    \ combine the collaboration of the Internet of Things gateway to realize the\n\
    high-low speed switching and transmission of sensing data.\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2336\n36 of 46\n(a) The deployment of edge gateway in the Internet of Things.\
    \ The conditions of edge\ngateway coverage and service terminal trafﬁc generator,\
    \ the factors affecting the ofﬂoad-\ning delay of computing tasks, and the constraints\
    \ of edge gateway capacity allocation.\nFollowing that, the edge gateway deployment\
    \ optimization model was established and\noptimized.\n(b) To solve the problem\
    \ of base station deployment in the Low Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN), the\
    \ received signal values of all terminal test points can be predicted\nby combining\
    \ the terminal receiving signal prediction module. Then, the prediction results\n\
    are transformed into the weight values of all terminal test points during clustering,\
    \ and\nthe terminal test points are clustered. In addition, the location of the\
    \ base station was\nadjusted to achieve the optimal coverage effect and realize\
    \ the deployment optimization in\nthe whole application scenario.\n5.2. Optimization\
    \ Control under Edge Computing in 5G Intelligent Agricultural Production\nThe\
    \ popularization and application of 5G intelligent agricultural Internet of Things\
    \ will\nbring major challenges to the traditional cloud computing model, such\
    \ as high latency and\njitter, no support for location awareness and mobility,\
    \ and non-adaptive communication\ntypes. The production of smart agriculture often\
    \ needs to deploy edge computing to\nachieve real-time computing and reasonable\
    \ allocation of resources.\n5.2.1. Automatic Phenotype Monitoring Based on 5G\
    \ Internet of Things\nBy monitoring and sensing plant growth phenotype, the analysis\
    \ of crop traits is\nof great reference signiﬁcance for cultivating crop varieties\
    \ with excellent traits such as\ndrought resistance, poison resistance, lodging\
    \ resistance, high nutrient rate, and salt and\nalkali resistance. It helps researchers\
    \ select seeds of good quality for the next generation of\nbreeding objects. There\
    \ are many common image-based phenotyping methods in the ﬁeld\nof plant phenotype.\
    \ Among them, the image recognition method based on visible light has\nlower requirements\
    \ on experimental equipment, higher practicability, and can collect large-\nscale\
    \ plant image data. Therefore, the current deep learning can be better applied\
    \ to those\nalgorithms that use visible light images. All these require high-speed\
    \ data transmission,\nand how to collect and control real-time data in multi-source\
    \ sensing devices is a problem\nworth studying. At present, the main concern of\
    \ plant leaf recognition methods based on\nvisible light images is that there\
    \ are not many kinds of recognition methods. There are many\nresearchers working\
    \ on automatic phenotypic sensing platforms, which require automatic\nsensing\
    \ data pickup. Combining the advantages of high bandwidth and dense deployment\n\
    of 5G to realize automatic measurement and real-time computation of phenotype\
    \ is a\nproblem worth studying.\n5.2.2. Intelligent Sensing Real-Time Control\
    \ for Intelligent Agricultural Machinery\nMore intelligent agricultural machinery\
    \ will participate in the future smart agriculture.\nThey can combine 5G Internet\
    \ of Things and edge computing to realize smart agricultural\nproduction. Among\
    \ them they face the real-time control of equipment, which requires\nrapid data\
    \ collection and processing.\nIn the operation of smart agricultural machinery,\
    \ sensors deployed on the roadside of\nfarmland can sense all kinds of environments\
    \ and obtain important trafﬁc information. For\nexample, ﬁxed sensors such as\
    \ vision sensors and millimeter wave sensors are installed\non the side of the\
    \ road, and the information collected by the sensors is sent to the edge\nserver\
    \ for processing to extract information such as vehicle location and vehicle trajectory.\n\
    According to the multi-source information obtained by roadside sensors, crop sensors,\n\
    and smart agricultural sensing equipment, real-time data processing is carried\
    \ out to\nanalyze the operation status and calculate the results. Mobile edge\
    \ computing provides\npowerful computing and storage capabilities. The side camera\
    \ and millimeter wave radar\nare fused based on the edge server. Through data\
    \ preprocessing, space synchronization,\ntime synchronization, and tracking algorithm,\
    \ they can cooperate with each other, jointly\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n37\
    \ of 46\nbuilding an intelligent agricultural machinery environment sensing system\
    \ to make it more\nstable and reliable.\nDuring the operation of intelligent agricultural\
    \ machinery, target tracking should focus\non the following points: (1) Object\
    \ association: radar detection should be associated with\ncamera detection, while\
    \ the current fusion detection must be associated with the existing\ntrajectory;\
    \ (2) Tracking link: appropriate ﬁlter should be selected for tracking; (3) Tracking\n\
    management: tracking object database needs to be maintained.\n5.3. Scheduling\
    \ Optimization of Heterogeneous Nodes under 5G Smart Agriculture\nHow to optimize\
    \ the scheduling of sensing nodes in different rates, resources, and\nnetworks\
    \ is a problem to be studied in the intelligent agricultural IoT under 5G.\n5.3.1.\
    \ Sense Scheduling for 5G Smart Agriculture\nUnder such circumstances, how to\
    \ optimize the deployment of network resources and\nnodes to achieve better overall\
    \ network performance is a problem worth studying.\n(a). Sensing task collaboration\
    \ based on 5G: Sensing task collaboration is a hot issue in\nsensor networks.\
    \ Based on the connectivity, coverage, survivability, and task completion\nrequirements\
    \ of the network, this paper proposes a collaboration mechanism based on\nthe\
    \ limited energy, computing, and storage capacity of the sensing nodes and the\
    \ task\ncompletion requirements. The network topology is reconstructed by adjusting\
    \ the transmit\npower of nodes, neighbor selection, sleep scheduling, or mobile\
    \ node location. The decom-\nposition, assignment, scheduling, and execution of\
    \ tasks are accomplished cooperatively by\ncoordinating the behavior of mobile\
    \ sensor nodes. Topology reconstruction optimization is\nmainly carried out in\
    \ edge nodes and load balancing. In smart agriculture, the perception\nequipment\
    \ is more diverse, and the perception task is more complex.\n(b). Cooperative\
    \ scheduling of large agricultural machinery equipment: agriculture-\noriented\
    \ large agricultural machinery includes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mutual\n\
    sensing, and task coordination of multi-aerial robots. For example, building the\
    \ social\nInternet of Things creates a dynamic social network for each object\
    \ connected to the Internet\nof Things. Social networks are extended through node\
    \ proﬁles and trust levels to ﬁnd\nobjects that contribute to IoT applications\
    \ and solve resource management problems. Assign\nsensitive tasks fairly to objects\
    \ in the social network. How to optimize the sensing task\nof massive heterogeneous\
    \ sensing devices in the Internet of Things for smart agriculture.\nIt is still\
    \ a challenge to realize the efﬁcient collection of sensing data and the maximum\n\
    efﬁciency of network resources by abstracting network resources.\n5.3.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G Network Signal Coverage Scheduling for Agricultural UAV\nIn addition to\
    \ the upstream and downstream rate, end-to-end delay of services, end-\nto-end\
    \ delay of control, and positioning accuracy, the coverage height of wireless\
    \ signals is\none of the most important requirements for 5G networks in agriculture.\n\
    According to the requirements of UAV network indicators in each scenario in IMT-\n\
    2020 (5G), Advance Group—White Paper on 5G UAV Application, the coverage height\n\
    requirements of wireless signals of networked UAV in the application ﬁeld are\
    \ shown in\nTable 9.\nOn the basis of the existing network, it is technically\
    \ feasible to deploy a small number\nof base stations for the 5G communication\
    \ requirements of agricultural UAVs. However,\nthe actual network planning still\
    \ needs to focus on several issues.\n(a) Adjacent area planning.\nIn order to\
    \ make connected UAVs ﬂy continuously in the air, in addition to seamless\n5G\
    \ wireless network signals, civil UAVs also need to be able to switch smoothly\
    \ between\ndifferent cells and different base stations. In this way, it is necessary\
    \ to cover the high\nlevel of the community to have a reasonable neighborhood\
    \ relationship. In addition, the\nUAV communication terminal needs to switch from\
    \ the low-level 5G wireless network\nto the high-level 5G wireless network when\
    \ taking off. This also requires reasonable\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n38 of\
    \ 46\nneighborhood planning between the 5G cell covering the high-rise and its\
    \ neighboring 5G\ncell. Similarly, the UAV communication terminal needs to switch\
    \ from the high-level 5G\nwireless network to the low-level 5G wireless network\
    \ when landing. It is also necessary to\nmake reasonable neighborhood planning\
    \ between the 5G cell covering the low layer and\nits adjacent high-rise 5G cell.\
    \ Its switching band is controlled at about 100 m in the air.\n(b) Interference\
    \ problem.\n5G wireless networks are also self-interfering systems. All base stations\
    \ share a band-\nwidth of 100 MHz. Therefore, it is necessary to control the coverage\
    \ of the signal through\nreasonable planning and optimization. In this way, it\
    \ is necessary to avoid discontinuous\ncoverage or blind coverage caused by insufﬁcient\
    \ signal, and to avoid interference in other\ncommunities due to over coverage.\
    \ At the same time, the mutual interference between\nthe 5G cell covering the\
    \ lower layer and the 5G cell covering the upper layer should be\navoided. Of\
    \ course, this will require a long period of experimentation and exploration.\n\

    \ Agricultural Platform\nSmart agriculture 5G-IoT faces increasing network scale\
    \ and density, dense terminal\nconnections, and higher intelligence, and the failure\
    \ rate will increase. The production\nefﬁciency of large-scale smart agriculture\
    \ is an important issue. With the integration of\n5G, many intelligent applications\
    \ will be gradually popularized. These apps are built\naround the 5G Internet\
    \ of Things. How to quickly identify the faulty node or device and\nthe self-healing\
    \ ability of the platform are important research issues.\n5.4.1. Node Fault Identiﬁcation\
    \ and Early Warning Based on Heterogeneous Sensing\nData Fusion\nCombining the\
    \ collected sensing data for computational analysis and network topol-\nogy to\
    \ identify node faults is a problem worth studying. Due to the mixed deployment\n\
    of 5G and various sensing devices, mixed data sources, multi-hop communication,\
    \ and\ntransmission route changes, how to realize the fault identiﬁcation of sensing\
    \ nodes and\npossible fault detection is an important research issue.\n5.4.2.\
    \ Research on Fault Tolerance Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\n\
    Traditional perceptual networks generally assume unreliable perception. The actual\n\
    agricultural production will appear to be all kinds of failures. Because of the\
    \ intensive\ndeployment, the cost of ensuring all reliable operations is high.\
    \ Therefore, it is worth\nstudying that fault tolerance can guarantee the normal\
    \ operation of the whole agricultural\nproduction in a certain period of time\
    \ under limited fault.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n39 of 46\n5.4.3. Self-Healing\
    \ Mechanism Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\nIn smart agriculture,\
    \ production is blocked due to the failure of the sensing equipment\nnetwork,\
    \ which affects efﬁciency. Therefore, it is necessary to study how to self-heal\
    \ after\nfaults occur, such as network topology self-healing, to guarantee node\
    \ pathways. For\nexample, perceptual repair under dense nodes. An additional example\
    \ is 5G gateway\ncoverage self-healing.\n5.5. AI Application Optimization for\
    \ 5G Intelligent Agricultural Internet of Things\nThe application of 5G brings\
    \ new opportunities for smart agriculture, which is ex-\npected to solve the problem\
    \ of data transmission and storage. With the development of\nartiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ it is an important issue to study lightweight deep artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    algorithms or platforms combined with various scenarios of smart agriculture.\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms represented by deep learning have laid the foundation\n\
    for many scenarios of smart agriculture applications. With the popularization\
    \ of 5G, the\nrange of application scenarios of smart agriculture will be greatly\
    \ expanded. However, the\ncurrent existence represented by deep learning will\
    \ face the important challenge of how to\nachieve reliable and effective operation\
    \ under the condition of small cost in the scenario of\nsmart agriculture, relying\
    \ on massive data and powerful computing power.\n5.5.1. Lightweight Deep Learning\
    \ Algorithm Based on 5G-IoT Edge Computing\nEdge computing equipment has some\
    \ computing ability, but its computing ability is\nnot enough for massive data\
    \ model training. The challenge is how to design deep learning\nor machine learning\
    \ algorithms suitable for agricultural production. Better results can\nbe obtained\
    \ by training on small sample data, reducing the amount of data transmission,\n\
    reducing the cost of communication resources, and improving the real-time accuracy,\
    \ which\nis a problem worth studying.\n5.5.2. Multi-Source Data-Sensing Machine\
    \ Learning Algorithm for Smart Agriculture\nIn the 5G scenario, sensing nodes\
    \ are densely deployed, and heterogeneous sensing\ndata need to be calculated\
    \ and analyzed to serve the upper layer. However, there are\noften low data quality,\
    \ multi-source, heterogeneous, and multi-modal sensing data, and\nchanges in network\
    \ topology. How to calculate these mixed and redundant low-quality\ndata by clustering,\
    \ statistics, Bayesian, and other machine learning methods is an important\nresearch\
    \ problem.\n5.6. 5G-IoT System Service Model for Smart Agriculture\nAn important\
    \ means to promote the implementation of smart agriculture is the in-\nformation\
    \ physical fusion system based on 5G. The typical application mode of smart\n\
    agriculture is to comprehensively perceive agricultural information through the\
    \ agricul-\ntural Internet of Things. Massive sensing devices for agricultural\
    \ IoT are deployed in the\nwhole process of agricultural production and processing.\
    \ Various information (environ-\nmental temperature and humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ carbon dioxide, images, etc.) is collected\nthrough various networks, including\
    \ 5G. Traditional agricultural models will be changed\nby means of cloud computing,\
    \ big data, edge computing, and artiﬁcial intelligence. It can\nrealize intelligent\
    \ perception, intelligent warning, intelligent decision-making, intelligent\n\
    analysis, and expert online guidance of agricultural production environment to\
    \ provide\nprecise planting, visual management, and intelligent decision-making\
    \ for agricultural\nproduction. This is to realize the intelligent management\
    \ of agricultural visual remote\ndiagnosis, remote control, disaster warning,\
    \ and so on, and gradually establish the visual\ncommunication and application\
    \ mode of agricultural information services. Relying on\nthe knowledge of agricultural\
    \ experts stored in the knowledge base, reasoning, analysis,\nand other mechanisms\
    \ were used to guide the production and circulation of agriculture\nand animal\
    \ husbandry. It promotes the transformation of traditional agriculture, which\
    \ is\nhuman-centered and relies on isolated machinery production mode, to modern\
    \ smart agri-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n40 of 46\nculture, which is based on\
    \ information and software production mode. How to construct\nan appropriate application\
    \ service paradigm and model for intelligent agriculture 5G-IoT\nis an important\
    \ issue to be studied.\n5.7. Security Issues of 5G Internet of Things for Smart\
    \ Agriculture\nThe future of intelligent agriculture is highly intelligent, informationized,\
    \ and un-\nmanned, and security issues should be a concern. Due to the application\
    \ of 5G technology,\nthere are many data ﬂows and information ﬂows which are prone\
    \ to data deception, etc.,\nwhich will lead to serious consequences, such as the\
    \ death of crops or the poor quality of\nanimal husbandry objects caused by incorrect\
    \ pesticide spraying.\nAt present, there are many research results on the security\
    \ of the Internet of Things.\nIn general, attacks in IoT applications are classiﬁed\
    \ using the following two criteria: (1)\ninternal or external attacks and (2)\
    \ passive or active attacks. Therefore, the threat model can\nbe classiﬁed into\
    \ attacks targeting privacy, authentication, conﬁdentiality, availability, and\n\
    integrity attributes based on the characteristics of attacks that attempt to compromise\
    \ IoT\nagricultural nodes, namely IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud nodes. 5G\
    \ itself is relatively\nsecure. However, due to the speciﬁc application scenarios,\
    \ the security problems of smart\nagriculture have their speciﬁc characteristics,\
    \ which require joint analysis and research.\n5.7.1. Information Traceability\
    \ of the Whole Process of Intelligent Agricultural Production\nBased on 5G Blockchain\n\
    Food safety has always been a matter of great concern to the public. The traditional\n\
    tracing system has some shortcomings, such as information opacity, data easy to\
    \ be tam-\npered with, poor security, and relative closure. In the future, the\
    \ development of 5G,\ncombined with blockchain technology and its unique advantages,\
    \ will provide a new\nsolution for the reliable traceability of the agricultural\
    \ supply chain. In combination with\nthe communication capability of 5G, blockchain\
    \ technology can be combined with the\nsensing equipment of the agricultural Internet\
    \ of Things for semantic segmentation and\ntracking to achieve high security.\n\
    5.7.2. Intrusion Detection for Intelligent Agricultural Production Based on 5G\n\
    With the popularization of 5G Internet of Things in smart agriculture, the degree\n\
    of intelligent and networked agricultural production is getting higher and higher,\
    \ and\nmore and more security issues need to be paid attention to. Unique security\
    \ issues and\nvulnerabilities may arise, including network, control, communications,\
    \ services, etc. How\nto combine the agricultural production process and the structural\
    \ characteristics of 5G IoT\nto establish a security mechanism, rapid detection,\
    \ and early warning of the intrusion of\nkey steps in the production process is\
    \ an important challenge in the future.\n6. Summary\nIn the future, smart agriculture,\
    \ after 5G technology transformation and upgrading,\nwill show the following characteristics:\
    \ unmanned operation, precise production, reﬁned\ncultivation, standardized production,\
    \ and intelligent supervision. Due to its low latency,\nmassive data transmission,\
    \ and massive connectivity, 5G is contributing to the development\nof IoT in agriculture.\
    \ The combination of 5G with other technologies has spawned a number\nof agricultural\
    \ applications to reduce the environmental impact of pesticides, protect natural\n\
    resources, improve animal welfare and help farmers increase yields and save costs.\
    \ This\npaper summarizes the impact of 5G on the Internet of Things, smart agriculture,\
    \ and related\ntechnologies. The key technologies and scientiﬁc issues affecting\
    \ the development of 5G-IoT\nwere analyzed to provide some ideas for the development\
    \ of 5G in smart agriculture. The\nscope of smart agriculture is relatively large,\
    \ and many details have not been discussed\nin-depth. Further efforts will be\
    \ made in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.L., L.S. and\

    Copy Abstract Development of agriculture in Russia and Belarus is based on the
    practical implementation of "smart" systems in agriculture based on the use of
    modern wireless, intelligent technologies and Internet of Things. This review
    presents research articles (mainly, in Russian) published in the period of 2013
    – 2022 on the use of cloud technologies and Internet of Things for the development
    of agriculture in Russia and Belarus. An analysis of the use of cloud technologies
    and Internet of Things in the modern world is given on the basis of research articles
    and reviews published in English in the period of 2017 – 2022. The main directions
    of digitalization of modern agriculture are listed. The uses of cloud technologies
    and Internet of Things in agriculture are described along with promising directions
    for further research and applications. Keywords modern agriculture; smart farming;
    cloud computing; internet of things; survey Subject Biology and Life Sciences,

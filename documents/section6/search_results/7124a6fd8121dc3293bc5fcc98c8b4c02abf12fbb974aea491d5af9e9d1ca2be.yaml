    \ agriculture typi-\ncally have different functional and quality requirements\
    \ such as choice of communication \nprotocols, the data processing capacity, the\

    \ information system that meets the business objectives a sys-\ntematic approach\
    \ is provided. To this end a design-driven research approach is adopted in \n\
    which feature-driven domain analysis is used to model the various smart farming\

    Smart farming represents the application of modern information and communication\
    \ technol-\nogies (ICT) into agriculture to increase the amount of production\
    \ and economic returns, often \nalso with the goal to reduce the impact on the\
    \ environment (Rains and Thomas 2009). Similar \n * Ö. Köksal \n \nkoksal@aselsan.com.tr\n\

    \ Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nterms are used for the same purpose such\
    \ as precision agriculture, site-specific farming, site-\nspecific crop management,\
    \ prescription farming, and satellite farming (Adamchuk et al. 2004; \nZhang et al.\
    \ 2002). Smart farming builds on advanced technology such as cloud computing,\
    \ \nremote sensing, data-driven farming, big data analytics and internet of things\
    \ (IoT). Several \nimportant benefits of smart farming have been provided in the\
    \ literature including optimiz-\ning production efficiency, optimizing quality\
    \ of the crop, minimizing environmental impact, \nminimizing risk, conservation\
    \ of resources, reducing cost, increasing profit, and better man-\nagement decisions\
    \ (Sørensen et al. 2010, 2011; Rains and Thomas 2009; Zhang et al. 2002).\nOne\
    \ of the key elements of the smart farming is the farm management information\
    \ system \n(FMIS). Although initially FMISs started as simple record keeping systems,\
    \ modern FMISs \nare sophisticated systems with advanced modules supporting a\
    \ comprehensive set of farm-\ning operations (Fountas et al. 2015). With the introduction\
    \ of IoT, FMIS and smart farming \nin general have gained a new momentum. The\
    \ IoT helps in smart and automated information \ngathering and merging. It helps\
    \ as well as in monitoring sensor data coming from different \nmachines, animals,\
    \ plants, other farms and greenhouses and other systems such as unmanned \nair\
    \ and land vehicles. In this way, the decision making and planning in the agricultural\
    \ domain \ncan be further supported which can lead to even more effective and\
    \ efficient farming. With \nthe help of the IoT, farming practices such as yield\
    \ monitoring, cultivar selection, pest man-\nagement, irrigation, etc. can be\
    \ applied more precisely. Crop yield can be monitored and pre-\ncise crop maps\
    \ which show high and low production areas can be obtained readily (Rains and\
    \ \nThomas 2009).\nFor developing an IoT-based FMIS it is important to design\
    \ the proper IoT architecture \nwhich represents the overall gross level structure\
    \ of the system. IoT based farm management \ninformation systems typically have\
    \ different functional requirements such as the type of crop, \nthe type of sensors,\
    \ communication protocols, and the data processing capacity. Besides of \nfunctional\
    \ requirements also quality requirements such as security level, safety level,\
    \ time \nperformance, and overall cost of development and operation are also different\
    \ for different \napplications.\nThe different requirements typically require\
    \ changing the IoT architecture. In the literature, \nseveral reference architectures\
    \ for FMISs and IoT have been proposed that can be reused to \nderive the IoT\
    \ application architecture. Deriving the proper architecture however is far from\
    \ \ntrivial and this can impede the success of the IoT system. The objective of\
    \ this study is to con-\ntribute to the current state-of-the-art of FMISs by enhancing\
    \ the current architecture design \napproaches for IoT-based FMIS. Hereby, the\
    \ study aims to provide an architecture design \nmethod for designing IoT-based\
    \ FMISs. The approach presented adopts a feature-driven \ndomain analysis approach\
    \ to model the different smart farming requirements. Further, based \non FMIS\
    \ and IoT reference architectures the steps and the modeling approaches for design-\n\
    ing the IoT-based FMIS architecture are described. The approach is illustrated\
    \ using two case \nstudies on smart farming in Turkey, one for developing IoT-based\
    \ FMIS for smart wheat pro-\nduction in Konya, and the other for smart green houses\
    \ in Antalya.\nBackground and related work\nInternet of things (IoT)\nUntil recent\
    \ time, the internet was primarily used for interconnecting computers any \ntime\
    \ and any place but this required human interaction and monitoring. The IoT is\
    \ a new \n 928\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nparadigm that adds\
    \ a dimension to the current information and communications technolo-\ngies (ICTs),\
    \ whereby the dimension “Anything communication” is added to the communi-\ncation\
    \ capabilities. The IoT enables anytime, anyplace connectivity for anything, by\
    \ linking \nthe objects of the real world with the virtual world. In the IoT world\
    \ physical things and \nvirtual things, all interact with each other in the same\
    \ space and time.\nSince the IoT is the result of technological progress in many\
    \ fields such as wireless \nsensor networks, machine-to-machine communication,\
    \ mobile computing, ubiquitous \ncomputing, and embedded systems, the term “IoT”\
    \ might have different meanings. Many \ndefinitions of IoT can be found in the\
    \ literature, but the IoT is defined by the International \nTelecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU) as “the network of physical objects or ‘things’ embedded \nwith\
    \ electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these\
    \ objects \nto collect and exchange data”. Here “thing” is defined as: an object\
    \ of the physical world \n(physical things) or the information world (virtual\
    \ things), which is capable of being iden-\ntified and integrated into communication\
    \ networks (ITU 2005). McEwen and Cassimally \n(2014) formulate the IoT with a\
    \ simple equation as: “Physical Object + Controller, Sensor, \nand Actuators +\
    \ Internet = IoT”.\nThe IoT is the result of technological progress in many parallel\
    \ and often overlap-\nping fields, including those of embedded systems, ubiquitous\
    \ and pervasive computing, \nmobile telephony, telemetry and machine-to-machine\
    \ communication, wireless sensor \nnetworks, mobile computing, and computer networking.\
    \ What is important is that IoT \nadds a dimension to the current ICTs, which\
    \ already provide “any time” and “any place” \ncommunication.\nVarious reference\
    \ architectures have been provided for the IoT. In general, IoT archi-\ntecture\
    \ is represented as a layered architecture. In this case a “layer” simply represents\
    \ a \ngrouping of modules that offers a cohesive set of services. Based on the\
    \ literature (Al-\nFuqaha et al. 2015; Pandya and Champaneria 2015; Gazis et al.\
    \ 2015; Palattella et al. 2013; \nSheng et al. 2013) the reference architecture\
    \ is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe reference architecture includes the following layers:\
    \ device, network, session, appli-\ncation, business, management and security.\
    \ The device layer consists of sensors and physi-\ncal devices. This layer identifies\
    \ and collects data and specific information generated by \nsensors and physical\
    \ devices. The data gathered is passed to the network layer. In essence \nthe\
    \ device layer bridges the gap between the physical world and the digital world.\
    \ The \nnetwork layer provides functionality for networking connectivity and transport\
    \ capabilities. \nThis layer is also called transport layer. This layer securely\
    \ transmits data gathered from \nsensors to the session layer. The transmission\
    \ medium can be wired or wireless. The ses-\nsion layer is responsible for service\
    \ management and consists of functionality for setting \nup and taking down of\
    \ the association between the IoT connection points. Several session \nFig. 1\
    \  IoT reference architecture\nDevice Layer\nNetwork Layer\nSession Layer\nSecurity\
    \ Layer\nManagement Layer\nApplication Layer\nBusiness Layer\n929\nPrecision Agriculture\
    \ (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nlayer standards and protocols are offered by different\
    \ organizations. Although most of \nthese standards and protocols use the transmission\
    \ control protocol (TCP) or the user data-\ngram protocol (UDP) for transport,\
    \ they have different architectures and characteristics for \nvarious purposes.\
    \ The application layer contains the IoT services and manages the system \nusing\
    \ the data from the session layer. The implemented IoT application can be, for\
    \ exam-\nple, smart farming, smart city, and smart home. The business layer defines\
    \ business logic \nand workflows. This layer is responsible for the management\
    \ of all IoT systems, services \nand applications within the domain. The business\
    \ models are defined in this layer based \non the data gathered from the application\
    \ layer. The data is analyzed to build the required \nbusiness models and define\
    \ the strategies. The security layer is a side-car layer relating \nto the other\
    \ five layers and provides the security functionality. Similarly, the management\
    \ \nlayer is a side-car layer supporting capabilities such as device management,\
    \ local network \ntopology management, and traffic and congestion management (Köksal\
    \ and Tekinerdogan \n2017; Khan et al. 2012).\nArchitecture design\nSoftware architecture\
    \ for a program or computing system consists of the structure or struc-\ntures\
    \ of that system, which comprise elements, the externally visible properties of\
    \ those \nelements, and the relationships among them (Venters et al. 2018; Tekinerdogan\
    \ 2014; Bass \net al. 2012; Clements et al. 2010). Software architecture forms\
    \ one of the key artifacts in \nthe entire software development life cycle since\
    \ it embodies the earliest design decisions \nand includes the gross-level components\
    \ that directly impact the subsequent analysis, \ndesign and implementation (Apel\
    \ et al. 2013). It is generally accepted that software archi-\ntecture design\
    \ plays a fundamental role in coping with the inherent difficulties of the devel-\n\
    opment of large-scale and complex software. Research on architecture design in\
    \ the last \ntwo decades has resulted in different useful techniques and approaches.\n\
    Architectural drivers define the concerns of the stakeholders. A stakeholder is\
    \ defined \nas an individual, team, or organization with interests in, or concerns\
    \ relative to, a system. \nEach of the stakeholders’ concerns impacts the early\
    \ design decisions that the architect \nmakes. A common practice is to model different\
    \ “architectural views” for describing the \ndesign according to the stakeholders’\
    \ concerns (Tekinerdogan 2014; Demirli and Tekiner-\ndogan 2011; Clements et al.\
    \ 2010). An architectural view is a representation of a set of sys-\ntem elements\
    \ and relations associated with them to support a particular concern (Clements\
    \ \net al. 2010). Having multiple views helps to separate the concerns and as\
    \ such support the \nmodeling, understanding, communication and analysis of the\
    \ software architecture for dif-\nferent stakeholders. Architectural views conform\
    \ to viewpoints that represent the conven-\ntions for constructing and using such\
    \ a representation. An architectural framework organ-\nizes and structures the\
    \ proposed viewpoints.\nA recent software architecture framework approach is the\
    \ so-called Views and Beyond \n(V&B) approach (Clements et al. 2010). The approach\
    \ distinguishes three different catego-\nries of viewpoints or styles including\
    \ module, component-and-connector, and allocation \nstyles:\n• “Module” view category\
    \ that is used for documenting a system’s principal units of \nimplementation.\n\
    • “Component and Connector” category that is used for documenting the system’s\
    \ units \nof execution.\n 930\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\n\
    • “Deployment View” category that is used to document the relationships between\
    \ a sys-\ntem’s software and its development and execution environments.\nA software\
    \ architecture that addresses the concerns of specific stakeholders is here \n\
    referred to as “concrete architecture”. A concrete architecture defines the boundaries\
    \ and \nconstraints for the implementation and is used to analyze risks, balance\
    \ trade-offs, plan \nthe implementation project and allocate tasks (Tekinerdogan\
    \ 2014). Concrete architectures \ncan be viewed as specific implementations of\
    \ “reference architectures”, which are generic \ndesigns. In turn, a reference\
    \ architecture is derived from the knowledge and experiences \naccumulated in\
    \ designing concrete architectures in the past (Cloutier et al. 2010; Angelov\
    \ \net al. 2012). The concrete architectures differ from one case to the next\
    \ depending on the \nrequirements of the stakeholders involved. Reference architectures\
    \ can be used descrip-\ntively to “capture the essence of existing architectures”\
    \ or prescriptively to guide the devel-\nopment of new ones (Cloutier et al. 2010).\n\
    Related work\nSeveral studies discuss the adoption of internet technologies to\
    \ support FMIS (Kruize et al. \n2016; Fountas et al. 2015; Kaloxylos et al. 2012;\
    \ Steinberger et al. 2009; Nikkilä et al. \n2010; Sørensen et al. 2010; Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2010; Seelan et al. 2003; Murakami et al. 2007). \nThese studies have\
    \ focused on different issues including the adoption of service-oriented \narchitectures\
    \ for FMIS (Murakami et al. 2007; Steinberger et al. 2009; Wolfert et al. 2010),\
    \ \nthe development of data exchange standards for supporting interoperability\
    \ over the inter-\nnet (Schmitz et al. 2009), and the adoption and implementation\
    \ of geographic informa-\ntion systems (GIS) (Seelan et al. 2003). The main focus\
    \ of these studies is integration and \noperation of an FMIS over the internet.\
    \ The integration and adoption of IoT in the FMIS is \nnot explicitly considered.\n\
    In (Murakami et al. 2007), a distributed service-oriented reference architecture\
    \ is pro-\nposed for the development of information systems for precision agriculture.\
    \ This web-\nbased approach is focused on communication between software on a\
    \ service bus. In \n(Schmitz et al. 2009), the so-called AgroXML is proposed as\
    \ a standardized language based \non extensible markup language (XML) to be used\
    \ for data exchange in FMIS. In Nikkilä \net  al. (2010), a web-based approach\
    \ is defined to implement connectivity requirements \narising from the internet\
    \ and the management of GIS data. In (Sørensen et al. 2010), a new \nmodel for\
    \ FMIS is proposed to provide better information handling focusing on internal\
    \ \ndata connection, external information collection, plan generation, and report\
    \ generation in \nFMIS. In Kaloxylos et al.(2012), an architecture is proposed\
    \ to provide support and inte-\ngration of different stakeholders and services,\
    \ and interworking with the external services.\nThere are some studies in the\
    \ literature related to web-based architectures (Steinberger \net  al. 2009; Chaudhary\
    \ et  al. 2004). These studies present architectures to enhance the \neffectiveness\
    \ of web-based decision support system on which data can be requested for \nfurther\
    \ use via a web portal and a web service interface.\nInstead of full FMIS most\
    \ architecture academic research on FMIS is restricted to indi-\nvidual component\
    \ of an FMIS such as predicting crop yield, implementing a special sen-\nsor,\
    \ and the usability of an FMIS. There are only few studies that explicitly discuss\
    \ FMIS \narchitectures in a comprehensive manner (Nikkilä et al. 2010). For example,\
    \ in (Linseisen \n2001), FMIS architecture is discussed by focusing on an information\
    \ system gathering and \nstoring high accuracy GPS data. In Beck (2001), an architecture,\
    \ based on implementing \n931\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\n\
    object databases such as common object request broker architecture (CORBA) middleware\
    \ \nand Java languages is proposed to provide easier development, maintenance,\
    \ and easier \nintegration of information systems.\nAdvances in the functionality\
    \ of academic and commercial FMIS are presented in \n(Fountas et al. 2015). This\
    \ study investigates commercial and academic FMIS packages \nand performs a cluster\
    \ analysis on them. The authors indicate that commercial packages \ntend to target\
    \ daily farm office tasks such as budgeting, finance, recordkeeping, machinery\
    \ \nmanagement, and documentation. On the other hand, academic FMISs deal with\
    \ compli-\nance to standards, automated data capture, and interoperability issues.\n\
    There are also studies that discuss traditional on-site FMIS software. However,\
    \ these \nstudies mainly focus on the improvement of information integration of\
    \ traditional FMIS \nand do not take IoT technologies into account. For example,\
    \ Verdouw et al. (2016), pro-\npose an architecture to improve the standardization\
    \ and integration of data, application, and \nprocess. A service-oriented architecture\
    \ (SOA) based solution is proposed to improve the \ninformation integration implementing\
    \ business process management (BMP).\nRelated to IoT is the research on wireless\
    \ sensor networks which is reviewed in Jawad \net al. (2017) and Aqeel-Ur-Rehman\
    \ et al. (2014). These studies primarily focused on com-\nparing sensors and communication\
    \ technologies such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wifi, Sigfox, \nWibree, long range radio\
    \ and GPRS. Although these protocols might increase the number \nof possibilities\
    \ to communicate data in IoT, these studies do not directly offer design solu-\n\
    tions for FMIS.\nThis paper has focused on applying IoT for FMIS in particular.\
    \ However, IoT has also \nbeen applied in different application domains. The application\
    \ of IoT in agriculture has \nbeen reviewed in Verdouw et al. (2016). This review\
    \ showed that the IoT concept cap-\ntured the attention of the scientific community\
    \ in 2010 and since then number of stud-\nies has continuously increased. In total\
    \ 168 papers and books were reviewed in the paper. \nThe identified top topics\
    \ of these studies include food supply chains, arable farming, gen-\neral agriculture,\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and livestock farming, and open-air horticulture \n\
    including orchards. On the other hand, it is stated that IoT applications mostly\
    \ focus on \nbasic functionalities, including tracking, tracing, monitoring, and\
    \ event management. It is \nconcluded that although IoT is receiving an increasing\
    \ level of attention, it is still in its \ninfancy in the agriculture and food\
    \ domain which is suffering from lack seamless integra-\ntion and advanced solutions.\n\
    Case studies and problem statement\nIn this section, the problem statement is\
    \ presented that is illustrated using two case studies \nof smart farming in Turkey.\
    \ The case studies have been selected based on their relevance \nand their difference\
    \ with respect to the functional and quality requirements. The case stud-\nies\
    \ include the development of IoT-based FMIS for wheat production and tomato produc-\n\
    tion in Turkey. In the following, first the details of each case study are presented,\
    \ and sub-\nsequently the problem statement is described.\nCase study: wheat production\n\
    Turkey has 23.9 million hectares of cultivated farms. Grain production occupies\
    \ 49% of \nthis area. Wheat production constitutes 67% of the total grain production\
    \ (Turkish Land \n 932\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nCrop Office\
    \ 2017). Turkey’s wheat production is about 20 million tons yearly (Turkish \n\
    Ministry of Agriculture 2018). As such, wheat production is one of the most important\
    \ \nagriculture businesses in Turkey.\nOne of the key regions of wheat production\
    \ in Turkey is the region of Konya which is \nfar from costal area and located\
    \ on a major plain near the middle of Turkey. Konya has a \nterrestrial climate,\
    \ and big arable farms. Konya is the region in Turkey with the largest \nwheat\
    \ production. It produces 3 million tons of wheat yearly.\nCase study: tomato\
    \ production in greenhouses\nThe second case study is of tomato production in\
    \ greenhouses in Antalya. Tomato produc-\ntion in the world is 170 million tons\
    \ yearly and almost 12 million tons of this production is \nproduced in Turkey.\
    \ Turkey exports tomatoes and tomato products to many countries. The \ntotal export\
    \ is about 600 000 tons. Tomato is produced both in open fields and in green-\n\
    houses. About 51% of greenhouse production in Turkey is tomato.\nAntalya is located\
    \ in the south of Turkey just north of the Mediterranean coast. The \ntypical\
    \ Mediterranean climate of the region is suitable for vegetable and fruit production.\
    \ \nCurrently, specialty greenhouse farming is very common in Antalya. Some 80%\
    \ of glass \ngreenhouses and 50% of plastic greenhouses of Turkey are in Antalya.\n\
    Problem description\nGenerally, wheat and tomato are produced with traditional\
    \ farming practices in Konya and \nAntalya regions. A general observation from\
    \ governmental reports is that a small part of \nthe farmers in these regions\
    \ use traditional FMIS (Turkish Ministry of Agriculture 2018). \nEven with the\
    \ use of FMISs several problems in the agricultural sector could still be \nidentified.\n\
    Inefficient crop production\nTo meet the growing population in Turkey it is important\
    \ to increase the crop production, \nwhich requires a more effective and efficient\
    \ crop production. According to the Turkish \nStatistical Institute (TSI), Turkey\
    \ is one of the top 10 wheat producers in the world. But \nthis production is\
    \ not sufficient for Turkey’s growing internal demand. In order to com-\npensate\
    \ the need, Turkey imports more than 4 million tons of wheat each year. From the\
    \ \nefficiency point (tons/hectare) of view improvements are required and possible.\
    \ Turkey’s \naverage wheat yield is about 2.6 tons/ha.\nInefficient usage of soil\n\
    Turkey has 2.2 million farmers, and 23.9 million hectares cultivated farms but\
    \ 17% of ara-\nble farms are fallow (Turkish Ministry of Agriculture 2018). One\
    \ of the reasons for this is \ndue to lack of insight and support regarding decision\
    \ making on crop production, soil ferti-\nlization, and pesticide management.\n\
    933\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nIncrease in cost of farming\
    \ inputs\nIn the last years the cost of fertilizers, fuel and pesticides have\
    \ dramatically increased, but \nthe usage of these inputs has not been effectively\
    \ monitored. This has adversely affected \nfarming and greenhouse production profit.\
    \ As a result of this, the number of farmers in \nthese domains have decreased\
    \ and the overall production has declined. To solve these prob-\nlems, better\
    \ monitoring and management of inputs is required to decrease the overall costs.\n\
    These problems can, to some extent, be tackled by focusing on improved business\
    \ and \nlogistics processes, by applying total quality and smart farming principles,\
    \ and appropri-\nate sensing and effector technologies. Yet, these solutions remain\
    \ limited compared to the \nadoption of IoT that provides further optimization\
    \ by enabling the integration of various \ntechnologies such as (wireless) sensor\
    \ networks, mobile computing, cloud network, data \nanalytics, and decision support\
    \ systems.\nTo cope with these problems IoT can be considered a feasible solution\
    \ (Dlodlo and \nKalezhi 2015; Ma et  al. 2011). IoT enables the use of sensors\
    \ to measure the required \nparameters (e.g. soil quality), support the decision-making\
    \ process using services such as \ndata analytics, and use actuators to execute\
    \ the proper action at the right time and right \nplace. This is for example the\
    \ case for the wheat and tomato production that has been \ndescribed in the previous\
    \ sections. With the introduction of IoT several benefits are envi-\nsioned. Firstly,\
    \ determining the variability in yield potential might allow optimizing pro-\n\
    duction at each site. With the help of smart farming practices such as site-specific\
    \ soil \nnutrition management, quality of the soil can be improved. Also, pest\
    \ management allows \nmapping pest populations and obtaining site-specific application\
    \ maps reducing pesticide \nusage and minimizing environmental impact. Managing\
    \ farming practices and obtaining \nprofit maps can help reducing the risk in\
    \ agriculture. Better irrigation, fertilization prac-\ntices, and pest management\
    \ strategies save resources. Crop production problems can be \nsolved more precisely\
    \ and in less time with smart farming. Further, long term data can \nbe collected\
    \ and analyzed, leading to better strategic management decisions. Saving input\
    \ \nmaterials and resources enables reducing labor requirements and cost. Finally,\
    \ reducing \ncost and improving quality will increase profits obtained. So far\
    \ with the existing FMIS \nthese goals could not be fully realized or are only\
    \ achieved to a limited extent.\nAlthough IoT promises to be very worthwhile,\
    \ it is not easy to develop an IoT-based \nFMIS. In the literature, various different\
    \ reference architectures have been proposed for \nboth IoT and FMIS. Recently,\
    \ the two concepts are further integrated leading to an IoT \nbased FMIS architecture.\
    \ Unfortunately, deriving a concrete application architecture for \nthe specific\
    \ farming situation is far from trivial. This is because the existing architectures\
    \ \nare usually represented as reference architectures that are too abstract and\
    \ do not consider \nfurther details that are required to derive the application\
    \ architecture. To derive the con-\ncrete architecture for a particular context,\
    \ the different features of FMIS and IoT should be \nselected. This includes for\
    \ example the different management functionality, the security \nprotocols, the\
    \ device communication protocols, and the cloud services. For each of these \n\
    many different selections can be made and the combination of these leads to a\
    \ broad design \nspace.\nObviously, given a description for the smart farming\
    \ system many different architecture \nalternatives can be identified. Since the\
    \ architecture has a direct systemic impact on the \noverall IoT based smart farming\
    \ it is important to derive the proper architecture to meet the \noverall smart\
    \ farming requirements of the stakeholders. For guiding the architect in deriv-\n\
    ing the customized concrete architecture a systematic approach is necessary.\n\

    In Fig. 2, the proposed development approach for deriving an IoT-based FMIS applica-\n\
    tion architecture is shown. The approach consists of two basic activities including\
    \ Domain \nEngineering and FMIS Development. In essence, the approach is based\
    \ on the product line \nengineering process as described in the literature (Tüzün\
    \ et al. 2015; Capilla et al. 2014; \nApel et al. 2013).\nThe Domain Engineering\
    \ activity focuses on developing and preparing the development \nartefacts (e.g.\
    \ design and code) for the FMIS. The first step includes the development of an\
    \ \nIoT FMIS family feature model that defines the common and variant features\
    \ of the differ-\nent FMISs. The subsequent step focuses on developing the reference\
    \ architecture for IoT \nbased FMIS. The final step in the domain engineering\
    \ activity aims to develop the reusable \ncomponents that will be necessary to\
    \ develop the FMIS based on the reference architec-\nture. The following sections\
    \ elaborate on the development of the family feature model and \nthen present\
    \ the corresponding reference architecture.\nThe FMIS development activity focuses\
    \ on a specific IoT-based FMIS. The FMIS will \nbe developed based on reuse of\
    \ the artefacts in the domain engineering activity. The first \nstep in the application\
    \ engineering includes the selection of the features of the application. \nFurther,\
    \ the features will include both features for the IoT and the FMIS. These will\
    \ be \nusually different for different FMISs in different contexts. Based on the\
    \ selected features \nthe specific FMIS application architecture will be developed\
    \ starting from the reference \narchitecture of the domain engineering activity.\
    \ The final step includes the implementation \nof the FMIS. In this final step,\
    \ the components developed earlier in the domain engineering \nactivity will be\
    \ reused. Very often a simulation system can be developed for FMIS to vali-\n\
    date the system before deciding on the large-scale investment.\nDomain Engineering\n\

    \ \n1 3\nFamily feature model\nThe first step of the domain engineering activity\
    \ of the proposed approach in Fig. 2 is \nthe development of a family feature\
    \ diagram for IoT-based FMIS. A feature diagram is \na tree that is used to model\
    \ the commonalities and differences within a specific domain \nor system. The\
    \ feature diagram includes a root node representing the domain or system \nthat\
    \ features the essential characteristics or externally visible properties of the\
    \ system \n(Tekinerdogan et al. 2012). Features may have sub-features which can\
    \ lead to a hier-\narchical tree. Features can be mandatory or variant. Variant\
    \ features are usually rep-\nresented as optional or alternative features. Optional\
    \ features can be selected or not, \nwhereby alternative features require the\
    \ selection of one of the defined features. A fea-\nture configuration is a set\
    \ of features which describes a member of a communication \nprotocol. A feature\
    \ constraint further restricts the possible selection of features to define \n\
    configurations.\nThe domain analysis consists of two basic activities including\
    \ domain scoping and \ndomain modeling. In the scoping process, the domain scope\
    \ is defined and the set of \nknowledge sources are selected. In the domain modeling\
    \ process the feature diagram is \nprovided.\nDuring the domain scoping process\
    \ for the IoT based FMIS, not only scientific papers \nbut also websites and white\
    \ papers of the important vendors and stakeholders in the IoT \nand smart farming\
    \ domains have been considered. The selected list of important sources \nthat\
    \ were considered for IoT are shown in Appendix 1, the list of sources for smart\
    \ farming \nare shown in Appendix 2. It is not claimed that the set of sources\
    \ is comprehensive but an \nanalysis of these selected studies shows a convergence\
    \ and agreement on the concepts. In \nthe following section the feature diagram\
    \ for IoT is described first followed by a descrip-\ntion of the feature diagram\
    \ for smart farming.\nFeature model for IoT\nBased on the primary studies given\
    \ in Appendix 1, the top-level feature diagram of the IoT \nas given in Fig. 3\
    \ is obtained. In essence, the top-level figure diagram presents the design \n\
    features and as such includes the mandatory features for the layers of the earlier\
    \ defined IoT \nreference architecture in Fig. 1. The feature diagram states that\
    \ all the layers are mandatory \nfor setting up an IoT system.\nFor each of the\
    \ layers a detailed feature diagram that represents the commonalities and \nvariability\
    \ for the corresponding layer can be derived. Among the IoT layers it appears\
    \ that \nthe decisive layer is the session layer that includes the protocols for\
    \ initiating the connec-\ntion and the further communication session. Figure 4\
    \ shows the feature diagram that was \nderived from the domain analysis to the\
    \ IoT session layer communication protocols.\nThe top-level mandatory features\
    \ in the feature diagram are protocol type, source-target, \ntransport type and\
    \ architecture. The protocol type feature defines the protocols that were \nidentified\
    \ from the selected primary studies. These identified protocols are the following:\n\
    • Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT): One of the most popular protocols\
    \ to \ncollect device data and communicate with servers (OASIS 2011).\n• Extensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): is based on exchanges of XML \nmessages\
    \ in real time that is defined to connect devices to servers (IETF 2011).\n 936\n\
    Precision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\n• Advanced Message Queuing Protocol\
    \ (AMQP): A queuing system designed to connect \nservers to each other (OASIS\
    \ 2011).\n• Data Distribution Service (DDS): A fast data bus for integrating devices\
    \ and systems \n(OMG 2015).\n• The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): A\
    \ specialized web-based protocol to be \nused in constrained nodes and constrained\
    \ networks (IETF 2011).\nAs given in Fig.  4, there are three types of source-target\
    \ relations available in ses-\nsion layer protocols: Device-to-Device (D2D), Device-to-Server\
    \ (D2S), and Server-to-\nServer (S2S). In some studies, these features are also\
    \ called Machine-to-Machine (M2M), \nMachine-to-Cloud (M2C), and Cloud-to-Cloud\
    \ (C2C) respectively.\nSession layer protocols are closely related to the network\
    \ layer. For all communication \nprotocols, the transport layer could be either\
    \ the user datagram protocol (UDP) or trans-\nmission control protocol (TCP).\
    \ Some protocols like DDS, support both UDP and TCP. \nThe addressing scheme (unicast,\
    \ broadcast, or multicast) might be important depending \non the application requirements.\
    \ The selection of network layer protocol is important since \nusing TCP and/or\
    \ UDP changes the characteristics of the communication from perfor-\nmance and\
    \ security perspectives. The layer below the network layer, that is the device\
    \ layer \nincludes the IoT devices that have a direct connection with the physical\
    \ devices. The physi-\ncal devices have different functionality and transmission\
    \ range. If low power devices and \nnetworks will be used, adoption of TCP in\
    \ the network layer is generally less feasible, and \nlikewise the UDP protocol\
    \ is used instead. On the other hand, TCP is required for support-\ning security\
    \ and the common security protocols of (SSL/TLS) are not available using UDP.\n\
    The architecture of the session layer protocols can be either publish-subscribe\
    \ or \nrequest-reply. In publish-subscribe architecture, participants (e.g. sensors)\

    \ to this topic \nmight read data. In this architecture publishers and subscribers\
    \ do not need to know each \nother, and do not need to be operating at the same\
    \ time, i.e. this communication type pro-\nvides time and space uncoupling. This\
    \ type of communication is well suited for data that \nmust flow from one producer\
    \ to many consumers. On the other hand, for the request-reply \narchitecture,\
    \ senders and receivers do need to know each other. The requester sends a \nrequest\
    \ message and waits for the response. When the replier (e.g. sensor) receives\
    \ the \nrequest, it responds with a reply message. The session layer protocols\
    \ of IoT generally use \npublish-subscribe architecture except in the case of\
    \ CoAP in which a request-reply pattern \nis adopted. There are many criteria\
    \ to select the right IoT session layer protocol depending \non the application\
    \ requirement. Further information on the selection of the proper IoT ses-\nsion\
    \ layer protocol is provided in (Köksal and Tekinerdogan 2017).\nFeature model\
    \ for farm management information systems\nFor IoT based smart farming the other\
    \ important domain is of smart farming itself. Similar \nto the IoT domain again\
    \ a domain analysis process has been applied in which relevant pri-\nmary studies\
    \ on smart farming were searched and based on these selected studies a feature\
    \ \ndiagram was derived representing the common and variant features. The selected\
    \ primary \nstudies are listed in Appendix 2. Based on the literature the following\
    \ sub-domains for \nsmart farming could be identified: (1) Global Positioning\
    \ Systems (GPS), (2) Geographical \nInformation Systems (GIS), (3) Sensors, (4)\
    \ Variable Rate Technology (VRT), (5) Yield \nMonitoring (YM), (6) Yield Mapping\
    \ (YMAP), and (7) Farm Management Information \nSystems (FMIS).\nFMIS software\
    \ is a core part of the smart farming. FMISs are used to collect and pro-\ncess\
    \ data used to manage all farming operations. The top-level feature diagram for\
    \ FMIS \nis given in Fig. 5. The right part of the feature diagram has been derived\
    \ from the FMIS \nfunctions as defined in (Fountas et al. 2015). The left part\
    \ focuses on the IoT related func-\ntionality of FMIS including collection of\
    \ data, processing data, visualization of data, com-\nmunication with external\
    \ systems, and system management. This paper will further focus \non the IoT FMIS\
    \ aspects.\nThe data acquisition feature defines the gathering of data from sensors\
    \ and other systems \nused in smart farming such as tractors, agribots and unmanned\
    \ vehicles. It includes func-\ntions for processing the gathered data whereby\
    \ useful information is extracted using data \nmining, machine learning, and image\
    \ processing. The data visualization feature defines the \ndisplaying of processed\
    \ data in different forms. Apart from classical tables, reports, and \nmonitoring\
    \ tools, dedicated visualization maps are essential for smart farming applications.\
    \ \nMaps such as yield maps, soil maps, lighting maps, and profit maps are displayed\
    \ for dif-\nferent purposes. The system management feature defines the management\
    \ of data acquisi-\ntion, processing, visualization, and external system communication\
    \ features of FMIS. The \nquality related functions such as reliability, scalability,\
    \ extensibility, and security are con-\nsidered in this feature. Finally, the\
    \ “communication with external systems” feature defines \nthe communication with\
    \ external systems, such as a weather forecast system. Each of these \nfeatures\
    \ are shown in a different color in Fig. 5 to refer to these in later sections.\n\
    \ 938\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nFeature model for IoT based\
    \ FMIS\nIn principle, IoT and FMIS are independent concepts and as such these\
    \ have been mod-\neled separately in the previous sub-sections. In principle the\
    \ features from the IoT feature \ndiagram and the features from the FMIS feature\
    \ diagram could have been selected. Alter-\nnatively, the notion of an IoT based\
    \ FMIS can be considered as the integration of both \nconcepts that needs to be\
    \ separately considered. To this end, Fig. 6 shows the integrated \nfamily feature\
    \ diagram derived from the feature models for IoT and FMIS. The focus was \non\
    \ FMIS as the dominant decomposition and the IoT features were integrated in the\
    \ sepa-\nrate leaves of the FMIS feature tree. In the figure for different type\
    \ of features different fill \npatterns have been used. The detailed feature diagram\
    \ given in Fig. 6 can in principle be \nfurther extended with respect to specific\
    \ project requirements. For the context of this paper \nthough, the provided feature\
    \ models are sufficient to illustrate the approach.\nIn IoT based FMIS, data acquisition\
    \ consists of IoT data acquisition and conventional \ndata acquisition to support\
    \ legacy systems. IoT data acquisition contains 5 alternative IoT \nsession layer\
    \ protocols as discussed earlier namely MQTT, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, and \nCoAP. Depending\
    \ on the application one or more protocols for IoT communication can \nbe selected\
    \ for the FMIS. In the earlier section the criteria for this have been described.\
    \ A \ntraditional data acquisition feature consists of ISOBUS and controller area\
    \ network (CAN) \nprotocols. As stated before, other (legacy or non-IoT) protocols\
    \ can be added to the feature \ndiagram.\nData processing features mainly depend\
    \ on the application type and include Image/\nVideo processing, data mining, data\
    \ logging, and decision-support features. One or more \nfeatures might be used\
    \ at the same time. Depending on the application requirements these \nfeatures\
    \ can be extended to use different processing features.\nFarm Management \nInforma\x12\

    control features. Finally, external services feature contains externally communicated\
    \ \nsystems such as weather forecast, finance services, and other external systems.\n\
    Reference architecture for FMIS\nOnce the family feature models for IoT based\
    \ FMISs have been developed, the next step \nis the development of the reference\
    \ architecture for the potential systems. In fact, in the \nliterature several\
    \ reference architectures have already been proposed for FMISs (Nikkilä \net al.\
    \ 2010; Sørensen et al. 2010, 2011; Beck 2001; Fountas et al. 2006) However, in\
    \ gen-\neral these reference architectures are either at a conceptual level and/or\
    \ do not consider IoT \naspects explicitly. Hence, in this section, the reference\
    \ architecture for IoT based FMIS will \nbe introduced. For this, selected viewpoints\
    \ of the Views and Beyond architecture frame-\nwork (Clements et al. 2010) will\
    \ be used including the decomposition viewpoint, layered \nviewpoint and deployment\
    \ viewpoint.\nDecomposition view\nThe decomposition view is used to show how system\
    \ responsibilities are partitioned across \nmodules and how these modules are\
    \ decomposed into sub-modules. Usually, the features \nin the feature diagram\
    \ are realized by one or more modules in the decomposition view. \nThe decomposition\
    \ view of the architecture depicts the overall structure of the architecture \n\
    which is reasonably decomposed into modular implementation units. It is regarded\
    \ as a \nfundamental view of the architecture since it serves as an input for\
    \ other views (e.g. work \nallocation view) and helps to communicate and define\
    \ the structure of the software. The \nproposed reference decomposition view for\
    \ the IoT based FMIS is given in Fig. 7. The \nmodules in the decomposition view\
    \ are colored to make the link with the earlier defined \nfeatures in the feature\
    \ diagrams of FMIS. In essence, the decomposition view includes the \nmodules\
    \ for data acquisition, data processing, data visualization, system management,\
    \ and \nmodules for communication with external services. The decomposition view\
    \ includes all \nthe possible modules for the various IoT based FMIS applications.\
    \ Note that in this case for \neach feature in the earlier feature diagram, one\
    \ module has been defined in the decomposi-\ntion view. Further the lower level\
    \ functionalities such as node discovery, and directory and \nname services, have\
    \ not been depicted. The following section explains the configuration of \na specific\
    \ decomposition view from this reference decomposition view.\nLayered view\nThe\
    \ layered view is similar to decomposition view since it reflects the division\
    \ of soft-\nware into units. The difference is that in a layered view, modules\
    \ are structured into layers, \nwhich interact based on a strict ordering relation.\
    \ This means that if layer A is allowed to \nuse layer B, layer A’s implementation\
    \ can use any public facilities of Layer B. However, \nlayer B cannot use any\
    \ facilities of layer A.\nFigure 8 shows the layered view for the IoT-based FMIS.\
    \ Here the dominant decomposi-\ntion is taken from the IoT layered view as it\
    \ was given in Fig. 1, and likewise it includes \nthe same layers of the IoT reference\
    \ architecture. The specific details are primarily in the \nhigher-level layers\
    \ including the business layer, the application layer and the data acqui-\nsition\
    \ layer. The FMIS business layer includes all required farm management operations\
    \ \n941\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nlogic and workflows such\
    \ as Fertility Management, Nutrient Management, Pest Man-\nagement, Weed Management,\
    \ and Irrigation Management. The FMIS application layer \nincludes FMIS Data Processing,\

    \ the connection with the \nsession layer protocols of the IoT. As such, this\
    \ layer includes the IoT session layer inter-\nfaces such as MQTT interface, and\
    \ XMPP interface. To support non-IoT systems, the mod-\nule conventional interface\
    \ also takes place in this layer.\nDeployment view\nThe earlier defined views\
    \ (decomposition, layered) focus on modeling the software mod-\nules of the IoT-based\
    \ FMIS. The deployment view elaborates on these views and is used \nto show the\
    \ allocation of the identified software modules to the hardware of a computing\
    \ \nplatform. The deployment view of an IoT based FMIS is given in Fig. 9. The\
    \ data pro-\ncessing module is deployed on the Central Cloud Server and Client\
    \ (Farmer) nodes. The \nother nodes are dedicated to sensors, actuators, and cameras.\
    \ The main sensors in the UAV/\nDrone and Satellite are cameras. Vehicles can\
    \ have their own sensors, actuators, and cam-\neras. Hence, these items can be\
    \ assigned to different nodes.\nCase study evaluation\nCase study protocol\nThe\
    \ primary objective of the case studies is to evaluate the impact of the developed\

    \ case. The retrospective case \nincluded a system which was developed before\
    \ and for which there was already an exist-\ning architecture with required design\
    \ documents. The prospective case includes the sys-\ntem that is planned to be\
    \ developed.\nThe goal for the retrospective study was to compare the earlier\
    \ result with the result \nthat is produced by proposed method. In this way it\
    \ was aimed to evaluate the effective-\nness of the method. For the prospective\
    \ case study, the aim was to evaluate both the \neffectiveness and the practicality\
    \ of the approach. The research questions were defined \naccordingly as it is\
    \ shown in the table.\nFor the adopted background and sources in the case study\
    \ research, official design \ndocuments have been used and interviews were held\
    \ with project managers and sys-\ntem architects. For the retrospective case study,\
    \ the requirements and design documents \nwere available, whereas for the prospective\
    \ case study only the requirements document \nwas available. For both case studies\
    \ project managers and system architects were inter-\nviewed. The project manager\
    \ had more than 20 years of experience in farm management \nsystem. The two system\
    \ architects had more than 15 years of experience in designing \nfarm management\
    \ systems.\nFor both case studies a qualitative data analysis approach has been\
    \ used. For the ret-\nrospective case study, indirect data analysis has been used\
    \ by analyzing the require-\nments documents, applying the method and comparing\
    \ the results of the method with \nthe existing architecture. For the prospective\
    \ case study, a direct and indirect data analy-\nsis approaches were used. For\
    \ the direct data analysis, semi-structured interviews were \nconducted, in which\
    \ a list of predefined set of questions were asked to the project man-\nager and\
    \ software architects. The predefined questions are listed in Table 2. The ques-\n\
    tions included a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) for\
    \ the pos-\nsible answers. In addition, explanation was asked for each question.\
    \ Note that although \nLikert scales are used for the evaluation of the approach,\
    \ it is not aimed to be quantita-\ntive but primarily qualitative. The interview\
    \ questions with Likert scales as such were \nused as supporting instruments to\
    \ the open semi-structured interview that were held \nwith the stakeholders.\n\
    The interview was organized as follows:\n1. First a meeting was scheduled with\
    \ the project manager and system architects for the \ninitial interview. The goal\
    \ of this interview was to capture the initial thoughts and experi-\nence on IoT\
    \ adoption.\n2. In the second step a short presentation was provided about the\
    \ goal of the developed \nmethod. Also, the operation of the method as well as\
    \ the final outcome was shortly \nexplained.\n3. In the third step the method\
    \ was applied both for the retrospective case (wheat produc-\ntion) and prospective\
    \ case (tomato production in greenhouses).\n4. In the fourth step, the researchers\
    \ analyzed the architecture design that resulted from \nthe application of the\
    \ method to the retrospective case and the prospective case.\n5. In the fifth\
    \ step, the researchers held a post interview with the subjects with the purpose\
    \ \nof identifying the impact of the method and its practicality.\n 944\nPrecision\

    \ sixth step, the researchers collectively assessed data from the initial interview,\
    \ \nreport delivered by the method, and the post interview. The assessment was\
    \ carried out \nseparately and later was discussed together to derive the lessons\
    \ learned.\nThe following subsection discusses the results of the above process\
    \ after the first two \nsteps. Subsequently the evaluation in step 4, 5 and 6\
    \ are described.\nFMIS architecture design\nAs stated before, the application\
    \ architecture is derived from the family feature model and \nthe reference architecture.\
    \ As described earlier the FMIS development method includes the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the application feature model and the application architecture.\nRetrospective\
    \ case study: smart wheat production\nFigure 10 shows the feature model for smart\
    \ wheat production that is derived after the \nanalysis of the existing case study.\
    \ This application feature model is obtained by reusing \nthe feature model for\
    \ FMIS given in Fig. 6 and selecting the features that are needed for \nthis case\
    \ study. As shown in the figure, for this case study, MQTT session layer protocol\
    \ \nof IoT is chosen. The main reasons were because open source implementations\
    \ of MQTT \ncould be used. MQTT supports TCP and device-to-server communication\
    \ which were con-\nsidered necessary in the given context. Likewise, the MQTT\
    \ feature of the IoT Data Acqui-\nsition will be used. Also, in order to support\
    \ conventional data acquisition with tractors \nused in wheat production ISOBUS\
    \ and CAN communications will be supported. Almost \nall data processing and data\
    \ visualization features are required for smart wheat production. \nSo almost\
    \ all of these features remained in the feature diagram of Smart Wheat Production.\
    \ \nFor this retrospective case study, the FMIS will be integrated with the external\
    \ weather \nforecast system only.\nTable 2  Questionnaire for the Interview\n\

    \ on the selected features as defined in Fig. 10, the application architecture\
    \ can now be \nderived. As discussed before, the architecture of a system is usually\
    \ described using multi-\nple different architecture views. For each of the required\
    \ architectural views it is necessary \nto develop the application arhiteture\
    \ view. Figure 11 shows the decomposition view of the \nSmart Wheat Production\
    \ that is obtained using the reference decomposition view given \nin Fig. 7. As\
    \ explained above, MQTT, ISOBUS, and CAN data acquisition modules will \nbe used\
    \ to support IoT communications. All the sub-features of the system management\
    \ \nfeature of the family feature model will be used, except the light sensing\

    \ used to obtain light maps in the greenhouses. Yield monitoring, yield \nmapping,\
    \ and soil type mapping modules will be used to implement data visualization fea-\n\
    tures. All data processing modules namely image/video processing, data mining,\
    \ decision \nsupport, and data logging modules will be implemented. Finally, a\
    \ single external commu-\nnication interface: external weather forcast interface\
    \ module will be implemented.\nLayered view\nFigure 12 shows the layered view\
    \ of smart wheat production. Similar to the other views, \nthis view is also customized\
    \ from the reference layered view diagram which is given in \nFig. 8. Here the\
    \ modules of the decomposition view are distributed over the layers in the \n\
    layered view. The modules MQTT interface and conventional interface are allocated\
    \ to the \nFMIS-data acquisition layer. The FMIS-application layer includes the\
    \ modules data pro-\ncessing, data visualization, system management and communication\
    \ with external system. \nThe FMIS-business layer include fertility management,\
    \ nutrient management, pest man-\nagement, weed management, and irrigation management.\

    Prospective case study: IoT based smart tomato production in greenhouses\nSimilar\
    \ to the retrospective case study the steps of the approach have been applied\
    \ to derive \nthe FMIS architecture. Due to space limitations the description\
    \ of the steps will not be \nrepeated and the specific diagrams will not be shown.\
    \ It should be noted that unlike the \nretrospective case study, for the prospective\
    \ case study there was no ready defined architec-\nture. This did not have an\
    \ impact on the application of the method but for the evaluation the \ncomparison\
    \ with existing architecture could naturally not be done.\nResult of the evaluation\
    \ for the retrospective case study\nThe previous subsection has shown the application\
    \ of the approach. As defined in the \ncase study protocol the effectiveness and\
    \ practicality of the approach has been analyzed. \nThe results of the interview\
    \ showed that for all the asked questions a score of 4 or 5 were \nprovided. Based\
    \ on these results the effectiveness and practicality of the approach will be\
    \ \nelaborated on.\nEffectiveness of the approach\nFor assessing the effectiveness\
    \ of the approach, the resulting application architecture was ana-\nlyzed and\
    \ post-interviews were carried out. For the retrospective study the application\
    \ archi-\ntecture was described in different document formats including MS PowerPoint\
    \ and MS Visio. \nFurther some detailed design documents could be accessed. The\

    \ viewpoint approach and no systematic approach was used. Nev-\nertheless, it\
    \ was possible to analyze the existing application architecture and compare it\
    \ with \nthe application architecture that was derived using the presented approach.\
    \ For the compari-\nson three relations were identified including (1) convergence\
    \ (2) deviation (3) absence. The \nconvergence relation implies that similar architecture\
    \ elements could be identified in both the \narchitecture designs. Deviation implies\
    \ that the resulting application architecture had addi-\ntional elements that\
    \ were not defined in the existing architecture. Finally, absence defines that\
    \ \nthe resulting application architecture had missing elements that were defined\
    \ in the existing \narchitecture. Overall the result of the analysis showed that\
    \ the resulting application architec-\nture was quite similar to the existing\
    \ architecture. In general, the convergence was very high. \nSeveral deviation\
    \ and absence relations could be identified though. With respect to devia-\ntion\
    \ in the resulting application architecture the modules UAV/Drone Control and\
    \ External \nWeather Forecast Interface were not defined in the existing architecture.\
    \ On the other hand, \nalso some absence relations could be identified. For example,\
    \ the resulting application archi-\ntecture did not have the module Finance Interface\
    \ Module, Farmer Data Module, and Simula-\ntion Module that were explicitly defined\
    \ in the existing application architecture. This became \nalso apparent in the\
    \ post-interviews. In the interview, the questions 2, 3, 4 and 5 relate directly\
    \ \nto the effectiveness of the approach. The architects provided a score of at\
    \ least 4 for all these \nquestions indicating that the approach is largely effective\
    \ for the corresponding case.\nPracticality of the approach\nThe practicality\
    \ of the method was assessed though questions 6 to 9 of the questionnaire. \n\
    The architects gave at least a score of 4 for all these questions indicating that\

    \ with the practicality of the method. Further it was stated that the architecture\
    \ \ndesign could now be more quickly designed. Another interesting issue that\
    \ was explicitly \nmentioned was the fact that the method helped to support communication\
    \ about the design \ndecisions early on. For the question “Will you use the method\
    \ again?” the answers were \npositive again and both architects indicated that\
    \ they would use this method for the sub-\nsequent project. The architects also\
    \ had some suggestions for improvement including the \nneed for allowing specific\
    \ delta modules when deriving the application architecture.\nResult of the evaluation\
    \ for the prospective case study\nSimilar to the results of the retrospective\
    \ study, the answers to the provided questions were \npositive and received a\
    \ score of 4 or higher. In the following the effectiveness and practi-\ncality\
    \ of the proposed approach is discussed for the prospective case study.\nEffectiveness\
    \ of the approach\nFor the retrospective case study, the resulting architecture\
    \ was compared with the existing \narchitecture to assess the effectiveness of\
    \ the approach. For this prospective case study, the \nresults could not be compared\
    \ with an existing application architecture since only require-\nments document\
    \ was provided and the application architecture had still to be designed. \nThe\
    \ requirements document was used to identify the required application feature\
    \ diagram. \nBased on this the application architecture was derived. The effectiveness\
    \ of the application \narchitecture and the overall approach was based on the\
    \ results of the interview.\nThe scores for the questions 2 to 5 related to effectiveness\
    \ were at least 4. This indicated \nthat the approach was effective for the given\
    \ case. The architects noted that the application \ncould be easily derived based\
    \ on the defined requirements.\nPracticality of the approach\nFor assessing the\
    \ practicality of the approach, the results of questions 6 to 10 were con-\nsidered.\
    \ Again, it appeared that these had all a score with at least 4. Similar to the\
    \ retro-\nspective case study the approach was found practical and easy to use.\
    \ Similar statements \nas in the retrospective case study were made. The explicitly\
    \ mentioned identified benefits \nincluded the reduction of effort to design the\
    \ architecture, discuss the design decisions, and \nthe surprisingly shorter learning\
    \ curve than expected.\nDiscussion\nThe introduction of the IoT has led to the\
    \ notion of IoT-based FMIS to support the smart \nfarming goals. This paper aimed\
    \ to integrate the IoT systems with the FMIS to align both \nsystems and create\
    \ additional value that cannot be achieved if these are considered sepa-\nrately.\
    \ This integration effort leads to the enhancement of the current FMIS with new\
    \ mod-\nules that support the smart farming operations based on IoT. In the presented\
    \ approach \nthese required new modules have been explicitly defined in addition\
    \ to the traditional FMIS \nmodules. The overall approach as such provides an\
    \ integrated view of the overall system to \nbetter support the architecture of\
    \ IoT-based FMIS.\n951\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\nThe method\
    \ that was discussed can be adopted for deriving an IoT based FMIS archi-\ntecture\
    \ for multiple different systems. Hence, the focus is on the whole product family\
    \ of \nIoT based FMISs rather than on a single system. The notion of product families\
    \ or product \nline engineering and the corresponding systematic reuse is discussed\
    \ in detail in the prod-\nuct line engineering community (Clements 2006). The\
    \ presented method is inspired and \ncustomizes the product line engineering approach\
    \ in which reference models are developed \nand applications are developed by\
    \ reusing these reference models. The reference feature \ndiagram that was shown\
    \ aims to target and integrate the domains of IoT and FMIS. The \nfocus in this\
    \ paper was primarily to illustrate the overall method. The feature diagrams as\
    \ \nwell as the reference architecture design could be easily extended. The architectures\
    \ for IoT \nand FMIS were discussed separately and the integration of both for\
    \ supporting IoT based \nFMISs was illustrated. The architecture can be extended\
    \ in two ways. First of all, the dif-\nferent views could be further refined to\
    \ provide an even more comprehensive result. This \nwould require for example\
    \ to further detail the modules that are needed in the decomposi-\ntion view.\
    \ Secondly, the architecture representations could be extended with other architec-\n\
    ture views. Three architecture views were chosen including decomposition view,\
    \ layered \nview and deployment view. If needed other architecture views in the\
    \ architecture documen-\ntation process could be used as well. The complete versions\
    \ of the feature diagrams as well \nthe detailed implemented architecture designs\
    \ have not been shown due to confidentiality \nissues.\nThe reference architecture\
    \ is designed in such a way that it is generic enough to derive \ndifferent concrete\
    \ architectures. Nevertheless, as is the case for all reference models, the \n\
    reference architecture does not provide all the details. Likewise, a system which\
    \ requires \nvery dedicated features that were not anticipated would not be covered\
    \ by the reference \narchitecture. Furthermore, the focus has been on illustrating\
    \ the reference architecture and \nthe approach for deriving a concrete architecture.\
    \ This appeared to be useful and practical. \nHowever, it is not claimed that\
    \ the reference architecture is complete, and likewise further \nresearch can\
    \ be used to refine and enhance the reference architecture. For example, the \n\
    device layer and the related functionality have not been discussed in detail in\
    \ this article. \nThis could though be easily added without loss of generality\
    \ and applicability of the pro-\nposed approach.\nAlthough, the approach has been\
    \ shown for two important case studies in the smart \nagri-food sector, the method\
    \ can be also applied for the development of other FMISs. The \npaper did not\
    \ focus on the implementation of these systems. The reason for this is because\
    \ \nof confidentiality and the goal to prescribe the system-to-be in the prospective\
    \ case study. \nFor the prospective case study, it is decided to develop first\
    \ a simulation system to evaluate \nthe outcome of the method. This is considered\
    \ as part of future work.\nThis paper provided both the reference architecture\
    \ for IoT-based FMIS and the overall \napproach to derive a concrete architecture.\
    \ The idea of systematic guidelines for deriving a \nconcrete architecture could\
    \ also be used for enhancing the use of existing IoT-based refer-\nence architectures.\n\
    Although the proposed method has illustrated the development of IoT based FMISs,\
    \ the \nmethod could even be used for developing traditional FMISs. In that case\
    \ the IoT architec-\nture part would be omitted and just the development of reference\
    \ models for FMIS would \nbe considered.\nThis paper describes a domain-driven\
    \ approach to design IoT-based FMIS and support \nthe architect in deriving a\
    \ concrete IoT-based FMIS architecture. Several other important \nissues need\
    \ to be considered to realize effective smart farming. Important aspects include\
    \ \nthe acceptability of the provided IoT technology by the relevant stakeholders\
    \ including the \n 952\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958\n1 3\nend-users,\
    \ development of cost-effective transition strategies, and farm management and\
    \ \nagricultural economics. Detailed discussion on economics and profitability\
    \ of IoT solutions \nin the agriculture domain have been addressed by multiple\
    \ studies including (Griffin and \nLowenberg-DeBoer 2005; Griffin et al. 2018;\
    \ Wolfert et al. 2017; Lowenberg-DeBoer et al. \n2000; Schimmelpfennig 2016; Kutter\
    \ et al. 2011).\nAdopting IoT-based FMIS is not trivial and usually requires large\
    \ economic invest-\nments. To justify these up-front investments the return-on-investment\
    \ both with respect to \ncost and quality should be defined. Further, IoT-based\
    \ FMIS potentially requires changes \nto farm equipment or totally new farm equipment.\
    \ Hence, it is important to analyze the \nacceptability and adoption scenarios,\
    \ and provide clear transition strategies for the efficient \nintroduction, usage\
    \ and maintenance of smart farming. Due to space limitations and the \nconcrete\
    \ scope of the paper this is not further discussed.\nA systematic case study research\
    \ has been applied to validate the proposed approach. \nEach empirical study usually\
    \ has to deal with a few potential threats to validity. In the fol-\nlowing these\
    \ are discussed for the presented case study research, and the mitigation strat-\n\
    egy for each threat is described.\nConstruct validity refers to what extent the\
    \ operational measures that are studied really \nrepresent what the researchers\
    \ have in mind and what is investigated according to the \nresearch questions\
    \ (Yin 2009). Table  3 shows various identified threats to construction \nvalidity\
    \ together with the counter measures.\nInternal Validity relates to a causal relationship\
    \ between treatment and the outcome. \nThe retrospective case study relied on\
    \ existing design documentation and related literature. \nThere could be missing\
    \ information in both cases that would affect the outcome. To miti-\ngate this\
    \ threat several iterations were done to derive both the application feature model\
    \ \nand the application architecture. In the prospective case, the lack of proper\
    \ requirements \ndocumentation could have an impact on the derived decisions.\
    \ To mitigate this threat, \nthis has been discussed with the interviewed persons\
    \ in detail and several iterations were \nadopted.\nExternal Validity concerns\
    \ the ability to generalize the results of the study. In the evalu-\nation, both\
    \ a retrospective and prospective case study were adopted derived from differ-\n\
    ent application domains. This was done to support triangulation and likewise extend\
    \ the \nexternal validity. The approach was considered effective for both case\
    \ studies but due to \nthe small number of participants a stronger statement could\
    \ not be provided. In the future \nwork a repetition of this study with multiple\
    \ other case studies with an increased number of \nparticipants would further\
    \ justify the claims of this paper and also support the quantitative \nevaluation.\n\
    Conclusion\nFarm management information systems are being increasingly applied\
    \ in many farming \nsystems. Several architectures for FMISs have been proposed\
    \ in the literature but these \nare usually abstract, and it is not trivial to\
    \ derive the application FMIS architecture for \nthe corresponding context of\
    \ the farm system. This paper has provided an architecture \ndesign method for\
    \ deriving application architectures for FMISs. For this, reference archi-\ntectures\
    \ for IoT and FMIS were adopted, and a novel IoT based FMIS has been defined.\
    \ \nThe architecture design method has been provided for deriving the customized\
    \ application \nFMIS architecture. To support the design of the application architecture\
    \ a domain driven \n953\nPrecision Agriculture (2019) 20:926–958 \n1 3\napproach\
    \ has been adopted whereby a family feature diagram was defined representing the\
    \ \ncommon and variant features of IoT based farm management information systems.\
    \ The \napproach was illustrated using a systematic case study approach. Both\
    \ retrospective and \nprospective case studies were implemented including IoT\
    \ based wheat production and IoT \nbased tomato FMIS. The case study research\
    \ showed that the approach was both effective \nand practical. It appeared that\
    \ both the reference architecture that was provided as well as \nthe corresponding\
    \ method appeared to be very useful in deriving the customized applica-\ntion\
    \ FMIS architecture. Since in general developing IoT systems is not trivial adopting\
    \ a \nsystematic approach appears to be useful in not only the final results but\
    \ also the inter-\nmediate steps that support the communication between the stakeholders\
    \ and the overall \nguidance of the design decisions. The contribution of this\
    \ paper can be useful for both \nresearchers who do research on IoT based FMISs\
    \ as well as practitioners who aim to archi-\ntect different FMISs. The future\
    \ work will apply the approach for other farm management \nsystems. Further focus\
    \ will be on the architecture design and integration of multiple differ-\nent\
    \ FMISs.\nOpenAccess This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative\

    \ (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noccurred, tens of applications including\
    \ smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions\nto modernize the\
    \ farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive\n\
    environmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This platform is deployed\
    \ and tested in a real\nscenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period\
    \ of March 2020 to March 2021. The experi-\nmental work fulﬁlls the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental\nparameters using\
    \ both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting\n\
    vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every\
    \ 1 h, after which the\nobtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone\
    \ to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h.\nThis low-cost platform can\
    \ help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental\ndata\
    \ over the geographically large farm ﬁeld, which leads to enhancement in crop\
    \ productivity and\nfarm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ experimental results infer that\nautomated and human-made sets of actions can\
    \ be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative\nintegration between IoT\
    \ sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture,\n\
    which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.\n\

    \ (FAO) predicts that by 2050, the world popu-\nlation will hit 9.73 billion,\
    \ and by 2100, it will be 11.2 billion; with the current population of\napproximately\
    \ 7.84 billion, this shows an increase of approximately 25% [1]. To feed this\n\
    larger population, food production should double by 2050 [2]. For example, the\
    \ current\nﬁgure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production should reach\
    \ approximately 3 billion\ntons [3]. This means there is a serious need to enhance\
    \ productivity and meet the demands\nof nations [4]. However, the current agricultural\
    \ land is restricted by various factors such as\nland and climate patterns, population\
    \ density, and rapid urbanization, which are constantly\nposing threats to the\
    \ availability of arable land [5]. To illustrate, in 1991, the total arable\n\
    area for food production was 19.5 million square miles (39.47% of the world’s\
    \ land area),\nwhich was reduced to approximately 18.6 million square miles (37.73%\
    \ of the world’s land\narea) in 2013 [6]. Thus, the gap between the demand and\
    \ supply of food is becoming\nmore signiﬁcant and alarming as time progresses.\
    \ Therefore, authors in the literature [7,8]\nemphasize the signiﬁcance of enhancing\
    \ farm management by using scientiﬁc strategies\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908.\

    \ which, in turn, drastically boost crop productivity\nand help in saving natural\
    \ resources [9,10].\nIn recent years of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),\
    \ researchers, engineers, and\nIT specialists are striving to participate in employing\
    \ advanced technology to achieve\na better life for our planet, as Figure 1 shows\
    \ [11,12]. One of those pillars of 4IR is IoT,\nwhich is considered as the fuel\
    \ of the 4IR since it contributes effectively by linking trillions\nof objects\
    \ and sensors, all of which generate real-time data. It is expected that around\n\
    100 billion devices have been connected to the internet by 2020 [13,14]. This\
    \ number will\nfurther increase since the IoT is progressively entering a wide\
    \ array of sectors and indus-\ntries, ranging from manufacturing, health, communications,\
    \ and energy to the agricultural\nindustry [15]. In an agricultural environment,\
    \ for instance, IoT technology has been uti-\nlized to deal with distributed data\
    \ collection from farming environments and, important\nfor directing farmers,\
    \ with real-time information of the farming ﬁeld [16]. On the other\nhand, integration\
    \ between IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracts researchers’\nattention\
    \ for various reasons. UAVs’ reliability, ﬂexibility, portability, line of sight\
    \ (LoS)\nconnectivity, efﬁciency, applicability, rapid deployment, and low maintenance\
    \ cost are valid\nreasons for considering such a technology. UAVs cover a wide\
    \ range of platforms, from\ndrones to high altitude platforms (HAPs), low altitude\
    \ platforms (LAPs), or tethered plat-\nforms [17,18]. UAVs have drawn tremendous\
    \ attention, both in the industry and academia,\ndue to their advantages and wide\
    \ applications [19]. For example, telecommunications,\nmonitor disaster-relief\
    \ missions, empowering smart cities, atmospheric studies, service\ndelivery, surveillance,\
    \ high-resolution imaging, and military applications [20,21].\nSustainability\

    \ IoT Architecture called LoRaFarM that aims to im-\nprove generic farms management\

    and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization\
    \ tool\nfor the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.\n\
    Authors in [27] developed a hierarchical smart farming structure based on the\
    \ collabo-\nration between UAVs and federated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ for crop monitoring.\nTwo important aspects of such collaboration have been\
    \ considered: designing the UAV tra-\njectories for efﬁcient data collection and\
    \ implementing effective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate\
    \ approximation) at the network level to assess relevant\ndata transmission. Experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 5908\n4 of 26\ndifferent crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the collaborative\nUAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both\
    \ smart farming and ecological\nagriculture.\nA smart agriculture management system\
    \ (SAMS) was introduced in [28], which\nproposed an automated system to help farmers\
    \ to increase crop production by crashing\ninto natural resources. The system\
    \ used different sensors to collect data required for the\ngrowth of the crop,\
    \ where these data were fed into the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for\ndata visualization.\
    \ The real-time data were stored on Firebase Database and then used for\ncrop\
    \ prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer.\nResearchers in [29]\
    \ presented an intelligent antifrost irrigation management system\nthat contains\
    \ a climatological station and ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation. The\n\
    solar-powered system interacts with the environmental system through a website,\
    \ allowing\nthe real-time interconnection, acquisition, and monitoring of information\
    \ through mobile\nphone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. Additionally,\
    \ the proposed\nsystem uses an intelligent Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to predict\
    \ the greenhouse temperature\nand control activation of a water pump, considering\
    \ humidity, the temperature of inside\nand outside air, solar radiation, and wind\
    \ speed. The intelligent model gives a prediction\nby determining coefﬁcients\
    \ with the analysis of variance method.\nNestor et al. in [30] developed an application\
    \ for water irrigation called “Agrinex.”\nThis system is an alternative approach\
    \ in collecting and measuring physical parameters\nfrom the environment, particularly\
    \ in smart irrigation systems. Agrinex is connected to\nseveral in-ﬁeld sensors\
    \ such as a water level sensor, paddy temperature sensor, and a\nﬁeld weather\
    \ station. This work aimed to make this information accessible anywhere\nwherever\
    \ there is internet access using a mobile application, which makes Agrinex scalable\n\
    and adaptable to changes. The mesh-based network recorded a maximum transmission\n\
    distance of 11 m from sink to sensor node with a 90% success rate. Data from the\
    \ ﬁeld can\nbe accessed remotely close to real-time when short network delays\
    \ are accounted for. It\nalso gives the additional beneﬁt of equipping lands with\
    \ an automated irrigation system\nthat conserves up to 81% of water consumption.\n\
    Authors in [31] proposed a system that decides whether or not water is needed\n\
    for farms by predicting the rainfall using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.\
    \ In the\nproposed system, voluminous weather and soil moisture data are stored\
    \ inside the cloud\nservers. Based on data collected by a UAV and then fed to\
    \ the GA, water spraying is\nperformed, which can be monitored using a mobile\
    \ application. Cloud servers are used for\nstoring and processing large volumes\
    \ of weather and soil moisture data. Results show that\nthe sensor-based system\
    \ is activated to check whether the GA-based system completes its\nprediction\
    \ correctly or not by sensing moisture levels from the soil. If the moisture level\n\
    of the soil crosses the predeﬁned threshold value, then plant watering is performed\
    \ by\nquadrotor UAV.\nResearchers in [32] developed a framework for monitoring\
    \ pests and diseases of crops\nbased on IoT and UAV that attempts to solve the\
    \ correlation between the occurrence of\npests/diseases and weather parameters.\
    \ The proposed framework is deployed in the\nYangtze River Zone of China, where\
    \ it uses rotary devices based on sun perception to\nobtain solar energy. Results\
    \ infer that low-altitude remote sensing and monitoring through\naerial imaging\
    \ of pests and diseases using UAV is reasonable, while more analyses of\nclimate\
    \ changes would provide some precautions in advance.\nA Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ system is proposed in [33] to collect underground soil\nparameters in potato\
    \ crops using a UAV network. Around 2500 sensors deployed under\nand above ground\
    \ are connected to UAV using Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\n(LPWPAN).\
    \ Simulation results show that due to UAV altitude and path loss, the link quality\n\
    between the ground sensor and UAV is reduced. Another observation is that the\
    \ lifetime\nof sensor batteries was varied depending on the location of the sensor\
    \ under or above\nground. Using LoRa technology and proper path loss model are\
    \ recommended as future\nwork to enhance link accuracy and performance. Regarding\
    \ path loss, authors in [22–25]\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n5 of 26\ndiscussed\
    \ different types of propagation path loss from an aerial platform perspective,\n\
    where Free-Space and Air-to-Ground are typical deterministic propagation models,\
    \ while\nHata and Okumura are typical empirical ones. Results show that an appropriate\
    \ model can\nbe selected based on coverage range, adaption across different terrains,\
    \ and better Quality\nof Service (QoS).\nAuthors in [34] suggested a heterogeneous\
    \ IoT sensor node system to sense acoustic,\nrain, wind, light, temperature, and\
    \ pH levels of the cornﬁelds for smart agriculture applica-\ntions. The system\
    \ aimed to achieve productive corn harvest in large-scale ﬁelds using a\ndrone\
    \ that gathers data and sends it to a gateway. The simulation results that monitored\n\
    at the gateway using the IoT application called Grafana show that it offers maximum\n\
    efﬁciency from the soil and follows the crop development according to the weather\
    \ and soil\nconditions, in addition to reducing the workload and the risk of disease\
    \ and pest, as well\nas optimizing irrigation and obtaining better quality products\
    \ at low cost. As future work,\ncollecting a wider range of climatic data and\
    \ geographical conditions would be useful in\ndesigning a model of smart farming.\n\

    \ 2021, 13, 5908\n7 of 26\nThis paper is motivated to present a low-cost platform\
    \ for comprehensive environ-\nmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This\
    \ integration between IoT and drone\nis also coupled with cloud computing technology,\
    \ which, in turn, helps in building sus-\ntainable smart agriculture and enhancing\
    \ crop productivity and farm management in a\ncost-effective, and timely manner.\n\
    Thus, the paper aims to implement a system that periodically collects data using\n\
    both under- and aboveground sensors on farms and sends them to the gateway; then,\n\
    using a drone with a LoRa module onboard, the obtained data are transmitted to\
    \ the cloud\nfor storage, analysis, and monitor the status of crops and farms.\
    \ The proposed platform\nis based on experimental work to fulﬁll the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time\nmonitoring of the environmental parameters for 12\
    \ months. Thus, a clear picture can be\nobtained to make wise decisions in managing\
    \ the crop and enhancing its productivity.\nThis integrated system of multiple\
    \ technologies used in the proposed platform develops\ncomprehensive under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors, along with considering an optimized\npropagation path loss,\
    \ which is a noteworthy shift from existing works. In this context and\nto achieve\
    \ the paper’s aim, the following research objectives need to be pursued:\nO1.\n\
    Identiﬁcation of environmental parameters affecting crop productivity;\nO2.\n\
    Selection of a propagation model that is suitable for smart farming;\nO3.\nHardware\
    \ calibration of related devices for experimental work;\nO4.\nImplementation of\
    \ the proposed platform and testing ti in a real scenario;\nO5.\nAnalyzing ﬁndings\
    \ and drawing smart action plans to help in precision agriculture.\n3. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the architecture of the platform, which aims\
    \ to monitor using\nboth under- and aboveground sensors and a drone for smart\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows\nthe conceptual work in a bird’s-eye view of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which consists of\nspace segment and ground segment. The space\
    \ segment comprises the drone, with its\npayloads including the camera, and LoRa\
    \ module, which is responsible for collecting data\nfrom a wireless server gateway\
    \ and then transmitting them to the cloud for storage and\nfurther analysis. The\
    \ ground segment contains three parts: (1) ground control station that\nis controlled\
    \ by the end user; (2) underground sensors gateway node that collects data\nfrom\
    \ underground sensors (soil moisture); and (3) HOBO U30 Weather Station Starter\n\
    Kit, which is an aboveground sensor that measures temperature/humidity, rain,\
    \ and solar\nradiation. Clearly, in the proposed platform architecture, the drone\
    \ acts as a focal point\nbetween ground devices including sensors, relays, and\
    \ gateways, on the one hand, and\ncloud, on the other hand, which reﬂects the\
    \ reliability and robustness of such a technology.\nThe rest of this section discusses\
    \ the proposed architecture from functions and speci-\nﬁcations in ﬁve layers,\

    \ as presented in related works of the\nprevious section.\nHata’s equations are\

    \ is a notable shift\nfrom existing propagation models. The θ is a vital element\

    \ Implementation and Testbed\nThis section presents the proposed solution as deployed\
    \ and validated in a farmhouse\nthat covered a large set of different agricultural\
    \ activities using ﬂying IoT. The low-cost\nproposal platform was considered for\
    \ comprehensive monitoring of environmental pa-\nrameters using both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors. Field experiments were carried out\nfrom March 2020 to\
    \ March 2021 at Medenine, Tunisia; some background information about\nthis region,\
    \ such as geographic location, soil property, and climate can be referred to the\n\
    map of world climates.\nThe proposed system can be explained in ﬁve steps, as\

    \ refers to rain gauge sensor, S-LIB-\nM003 refers to solar radiation sensor,\
    \ and S-SMC-M005 refers to soil moisture smart sensor.\nFirst, both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors collected relevant data from the farm every 1 h.\nSecond,\
    \ these data were stored temporarily on an embedded Secure Digital (SD) card in\n\
    the wireless server gateway. Third, the drone ﬂew and collected data from various\
    \ wireless\nserver gateways located in the farm every 12 h. Fourth, the drone\
    \ sent the data to the cloud.\nFifth, automated and human-made sets of actions\
    \ could be taken to apply smart actions\nfor precision agriculture, which, in\
    \ turn, dramatically boost crop productivity, and help\nin saving natural resources.\
    \ These actions could be obtained from the cloud into the user\ninterface smart\
    \ device. However, a decision support system could be introduced in a future\n\

    \ farming involves the integration of advanced technologies into existing farm-\n\
    ing practices to increase production efﬁciency and quality of agricultural products.\
    \ The\nevolution of IoT and UAVs has enabled the vision of sustainable smart farming,\
    \ where\nthese smart technologies have proven to increase the quality of crop\
    \ yield and reduce the\nenvironmental footprint from the agricultural sector.\
    \ This paper shows a low-cost platform\nfor comprehensive environmental parameter\
    \ monitoring using ﬂying IoT. The proposal is\nbased on experimental work to fulﬁll\
    \ the requirements of automated and real-time monitor-\ning of the environmental\
    \ parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These\nIoT sensors devices\
    \ on a farm collect vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent\nto ground\
    \ gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data are collected and transmitted\n\
    by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This platform is\
    \ deployed\nand tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the\
    \ period of March 2020\nto March 2021, covering open-ﬁeld and greenhouse cultivation.\
    \ This low-cost platform\ncan help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to\
    \ predict environmental conditions\ndata over the geographically large farm ﬁeld,\

    \ practical\nresults indicate that automated and human-made sets of actions have\
    \ been applied and/or\nsuggested that are smart actions for precision agriculture,\
    \ which, in turn, dramatically\nboost crop productivity and help in saving natural\
    \ resources. Examples of these actions are\nthe following:\n•\nFarmers are advised\
    \ to consider various strategies such as spraying chemicals on\nplants during\
    \ some seasons;\n•\nVarious plantings and quarterly grains are suggested;\n•\n\
    Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to ﬁeld capacity;\n•\nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from high light intensity\n\
    during summer;\n•\nAdjust water irrigation using automated dripping and sprinkling\
    \ based on environ-\nmental parameters;\n•\nUsing solar panels for powering the\
    \ weather station leads to energy efﬁciency.\nFrom a practical point of view,\
    \ the deployed nodes, which are fed by a solar panel-\nrecharged battery, have\
    \ correctly transmitted data for 12 months, with underground and\naboveground\
    \ sensors and despite bad weather conditions. Indeed, even though some\nsamples\
    \ were lost during several rainy days, once their batteries were recharged by\
    \ solar\nlight during the following sunny days, nodes restarted to transmit properly.\n\
    PL and RSS of the Hata propagation model of the distance between the ground station\n\
    and the drone at the cloud layer show reasonable results, in which the obtained\
    \ values\nsatisfy a high level of reception with the smallest attenuated signal,\
    \ besides achieving line\nof sight wireless connectivity in an efﬁcient and timely\
    \ manner. More elaboration can be\ntaken into consideration for future work, e.g.,\
    \ to develop a machine learning algorithm\nto predict environmental conditions\
    \ and then suggest solutions and/or precautions. A\ndecision support system framework\
    \ could be introduced as part of a future project to link\nthe farm’s smart devices\
    \ together to achieve an autonomous system. Moreover, the power\nconsumption of\
    \ the drone can be optimized to enhance ﬂight time, which leads to covering\n\
    wider farm zones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software,\

    ABSTRACT \nIn the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply\
    \ \nchains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many global\
    \ \nproblems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate \nchange,\
    \ and weather disasters. It has known that technological \nopportunities are available\
    \ for human beings to get out of these \npredicaments, solving the interconnections\
    \ between food-water-energy- \nclimate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional \nto digital. \n \nThe aim of this review is to gain holistic\
    \ solutions in a systematic \nview, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural\
    \ digital \ntransformation that will play role in sustainable development. The\
    \ \ntransition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering \nagricultural\
    \ and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital \nagriculture\
    \ combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are \nhandled based\
    \ on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and \nlogistics. Digital\
    \ technologies are explained with application examples \nsuch as the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial \nintelligence, decision\
    \ support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, \nreal-time monitoring systems\
    \ tracking whole conditions of animals in \nlivestock, the IoT-based irrigation\
    \ and fertilization systems that help \nenhance the efficiency of irrigation processes\
    \ and minimize water and \nfertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses,\
    \ blockchain-based \nelectronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and\
    \ robotics that \nreduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.\
    \ Moreover, \nrenewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between \n\
    technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and \nenergy\
    \ production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and \ndrip irrigation\
    \ systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a \nresult, for a sustainable\
    \ future, technological innovations that increase \ncrop productivity and improve\
    \ crop quality, protect the environment, \nprovide efficient resource use and\
    \ decrease input costs can help us facing \nin agriculture of today overwhelm\
    \ many the economic, social, and \nenvironmental challenges.  \n \nKeywords: Smart\
    \ farming, Digital transformation, Sustainable development, Blockchain, Artificial\

    \ Faculty of Agriculture \n \n1. Introduction \n \nAgriculture producing food,\
    \ feed, fibers, fuel, and raw materials by cultivating plants and breeding livestock\
    \ is one of the oldest \nand most vital sources in the civilization of human beings\
    \ and in the economic growth of each country that forms the backbone. \nThe latest\
    \ FAO report (FAO 2017a) emphasized that the world's population will be near 10\
    \ billion by 2050, and agriculture will \nbe a more deeply key role each day for\
    \ the continuation of life and socio-economic development. It has been predicted\
    \ that \nincreases in food, water and energy demands will be 60% (FAO 2012), 55%\
    \ (OECD 2012) and 50% (EIA 2019) by 2050, \nrespectively. \n \nAt global level,\
    \ while consuming approximately 30% of the total energy in during agri-food production,\
    \ this causes nearly \none third of GHG emissions (FAO 2020; Platis et al. 2019).\
    \ Global food systems are responsible for about 25% to 42% of all \nglobal greenhouse\
    \ gas (GHG) emissions emitted during production, processing, transportation, packaging,\
    \ consuming, and \ndisposing of food according to a study carried out for the\
    \ years 1990-2015 (Crippa et al. 2021). \n \nWhile agriculture is the pillar of\
    \ food security, it is the largest user of freshwater that affects energy security\
    \ (Tian et al. \n2018). Global projections indicate that the demand for clean\
    \ water, energy, and food will increase significantly in the coming \nyears (Hoff\
    \ 2011).  \n \nToday, agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater use and\
    \ 34% of land use, putting unsustainable pressure on our \nnatural resources (Lee\
    \ 2019). Also, water use is 80-90% in the agri-food sector including irrigation\
    \ (FAO 2016; Bundschuh et \nal. 2107). But irrigation only amounts can reach as\
    \ much as 95 percent in some developing countries (Mohtar & Daher 2016; \nFAO\
    \ 2017b). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n374 \n \nWater plays a key role in socioeconomic\
    \ development that strongly connects food and energy (Daher et al. 2019). Industry\
    \ \nconsumes 22% of water resources, most of which is used for cooling thermal\
    \ processes in electricity generation (EIA 2016). If \naction is not taken now,\
    \ such expanding gap between resource supply and demand would be further occurs\
    \ deep problems related \nto continuous population growth, climate change and\
    \ extreme climatic events, socio-economic development.  \n \nBoth agricultural\
    \ activities and production of food consume at large amounts of water and energy\
    \ (Roidt & Avellán 2019). \nTherefore, water, energy, and food (WEF) are three\
    \ strategic resources for the sustainable development of national economies \n\
    (Purwanto et al. 2019). It is becoming increasingly difficult to ensure sufficient\
    \ WEF with the impact of climate change, \npopulation growth, changing diets,\
    \ urbanization, and aging (Zhang et al. 2018; Alcon et al. 2019).  \n \nAgriculture\
    \ is also a major source of water pollution from nutrients, pesticides, and other\
    \ contaminants, which if unmanaged \ncan lead to significant social, economic,\
    \ and environmental costs (FAO 2017). In the recent decades, agriculture is beset\
    \ by two \nmajor discrepancies: the first conflict is between resources supply\
    \ and demand, while the second conflict is between economic \ndevelopment and\
    \ environmental protection (Yue & Guo 2021). \n \nIn recent years, global climate\
    \ change has caused many irregular and extreme weather events in many parts of\
    \ the world (Li \net al. 2021). As a result of global warming, intense drought,\
    \ severe hurricanes and storms, and extreme floods have begun to be \nexperienced\
    \ intensely in different parts of the world (FAO 2021). In addition, the success\
    \ of crop and animal production varies \ndepending on the short and long-term\
    \ complex environmental effects of global warming and climate change (Hatfield\
    \ et al. \n2011). In many places of the world, plants are negatively affecting\
    \ by climate conditions that are very hot or very cold, and wet \nor dry (Hatfield\
    \ et al. 2015; FAO 2019). Rising seed, fertilizer prices and wages, epidemic and\
    \ vegetative diseases, trade wars, \nflash floods, heatwaves, and other weather\
    \ changes negatively affect agriculture. To meet these challenges and meet the\
    \ demands \nof the future, countries need to develop policies and programs in\
    \ a sustainable way. \n \nIn a report published by UNECE (2021), it was emphasized\
    \ that demographic, economic, social, and climatic changes, were \nall exerting\
    \ increasing pressure on natural resources, including through a seemingly ever-growing\
    \ global demand for energy, \nfood, and water that threatens the ecosystems. As\
    \ a solution, the key to shifting towards sustainable development was highlighted\
    \ \nthat lies in the strategic decisions to be taken regarding natural resources,\
    \ which need to be better valued and more responsibly \nmanaged. \n \nAmong literature\
    \ studies reviewed, no article has been found that analyzes in view of systematic\
    \ and holistic related to digital \ntransition and transformation for a sustainable\
    \ future in agriculture. Most of the literature focuses on individual integration\
    \ of \nAgriculture 4.0 technologies and their applications in different sectors.\
    \ This review aims to close the study gap with a systematic \napproach, analyzing\
    \ digital technologies in agriculture for a sustainable future based on “Energy-Water-Food”\
    \ Nexus. \n \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives\
    \ the development roadmap of industrial revolutions and \nagricultural revolutions.\
    \ Section 3 introduces sustainable food and agriculture, water-energy-food nexus,\
    \ and digital \ntransformation concepts. Section 4 discusses precision agriculture\
    \ and Agriculture 4.0 topics under the smart farming heading, \ncovering novel\
    \ technologies, digital transition and challenges. Section 5 introduces renewable\
    \ energy and environmental \ntechnologies, new combined solutions; and discussion\
    \ and conclusions are presented in the 6th and 7th sections, respectively. \n\
    \ \n2. Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions \n \nThe expression Industry 4.0\
    \ was used to point out new tsunami of technological progress that was defined\
    \ in 2015 by Schwab \nas the “fourth industrial revolution” (Schwab 2015). While\
    \ the first industrial revolution in the 18th century was characterized \nby transition\
    \ from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy, the second industrial\
    \ revolution covered from water and \nsteam power to electric power (Adebanjo\
    \ et al. 2020). \n \nThe evolution of agriculture, from the primitive level to\
    \ the advanced level of today, took place gradually over time. Figure \n1 shows\
    \ together schematic timelines of both industrial revolutions and agricultural\
    \ revolutions. Technological developments in \nagriculture are divided into 4\
    \ long-term and named the transformation from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          375 \n \n \n \nFigure 1-\
    \ Time lines of industrial revolutions and agricultural revolutions (Liu et al.\
    \ 2021) \n \nPeriod that is conventional agriculture practices from antique ages\
    \ when farmers mostly used domestic hand tools for \ncultivation mainly relying\
    \ on manpower and animal forces to the end of the 19th century is accepted as\
    \ Agriculture 1.0. \n \nAgriculture 2.0 is referred as the period that is the\
    \ increase food production and reduce hand jobs between 1784 and almost \n1870,\
    \ when agricultural machinery was used for soil tillage, sowing, weeding, irrigation,\
    \ and harvesting (Liu et al. 2021). \n \nAfter passing from the main steam power\
    \ to oil and gas power, the industry 2.0 period of the 20th century started. Due\
    \ to \ndevelopments in the energy and transportation sectors, agricultural products\
    \ were started shipping to long distances. Resulting, \nfar communities connected\
    \ together and new agriculture markets emerged that farmers can sell their produce\
    \ (Liu et al. 2021). \nThe first assembly line that significantly increased efficiency\
    \ and productivity was set up for mass production (Zhai et al. 2020). \nThe first\
    \ agricultural mass production was applied to meat production in livestock. All\
    \ these developments provided making for \nlarge-scale intensive animal farming.\
    \ \n \n“The Green Revolution” era, namely Agriculture 2.0, is the phase of farming\
    \ that began in the late 1950s when new agronomic \nmanagement practices, new\
    \ synthetic pesticides, and fertilizers were used in agricultural fields and various\
    \ machines were \nmanually operated by farmers (Zambon et al. 2019). Thus, yields,\
    \ productivity, and returns increased at all levels (CEMA 2017a). \nAlthough increased\
    \ productivity and improved efficiency were achieved thanks to mechanization,\
    \ all of them, overconsumption \nof fossil fuels, water, and chemicals caused\
    \ the destruction of the environment. Indeed, still today, mankind continues the\
    \ \ndevastations with effects so great that it changes the climate in many parts\
    \ of the world.  Furthermore, the first programmable \nlogic controller (PLC)\
    \ was used in industry in 1969, depending on electronics and on information technology\
    \ (Yülek 2018). \n \nAgriculture 3.0, called also \"Precision Farming\" emerged\
    \ thanks to advances carried out on computing and electronics. These \ndevelopments\
    \ provided saving on energy in machinery use of and saving on the water in irrigation,\
    \ and reducing in use of \nchemicals in the field and, thanks to increasing operational\
    \ performance of agricultural systems (Ahmad & Nabi 2021). \nAccording to the\
    \ definition of the International Society of Precision Agriculture (PA), “Precision\
    \ Agriculture is a management \nstrategy that gathers, processes, and analyses\
    \ temporal, spatial, and individual data and combines it with other information\
    \ to \nguide site, plant, or animal-specific management decisions to improve resource\
    \ efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and \nsustainability of agricultural\
    \ production.” (ISPA 2021). \n \nAlthough agriculture has been affected from every\
    \ era of industrial revolutions, it should be noted the digital transformation\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector started with PA. Today, the agricultural sector\
    \ is experiencing a new revolution, called Agriculture 4.0 \nfrom with the affecting\
    \ of digital technologies also in \"Industry 4.0\" entered our life in 2011. \
    \ \n \n3. Sustainability for Future  \n \n \nUnited Nations (UNs) called for a\
    \ universal action plan related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted\
    \ on 25 \nSeptember 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives\
    \ of everyone, everywhere. The 17 goals are part of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable\
    \ Development. This agenda sets out a 15-year (2016-2030) plan to achieve the\
    \ goals. These were \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\
    \ Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n376 \n \nplanned to help measure\
    \ progress in each of the 193 countries that agreed to work towards achieving\
    \ the goals. SDGs 17 targets \nare illustrated holistically in Figure 2 (United\
    \ Nations 2015).   \n \nAs highlighted in report prepared by The World in 2050\
    \ initiative, governments that signed the 2030 agenda of the Sustainable \nDevelopment\
    \ Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are calling for profound\
    \ transformations that will \nrequire complementary actions from civil society,\
    \ science and business (TWI2050 2018). \n \n \n \nFigure 2- Sustainable Development\
    \ Goals numbered according to icons accepted by United Nations (United Nations\
    \ 2015) \n \nSetting off to carry out the activities in The World in 2050 initiative,\
    \ Sachs et al. (2019) presented six SDG transformations \nto achieve SDG targets.\
    \ Among which, Transformation 4 has taken attention as one of the key parts covering\
    \ sustainable food, \nland, water, and oceans. Transformation 6 covers the digital\
    \ revolution for sustainable development comes forward as a foremost \nforce that\
    \ makes a difference, also it has been also pointed out as the Fourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution. \n \nIn Trends in Biotechnology published in 2021, it emphasized\
    \ that biotechnology to be coupled with digital technologies will \nplay a key\
    \ role in transforming current land-use systems in the future (Goh et al. 2021).\
    \ \n \n3.1. Sustainable food and agriculture  \n \nThe FAO has established five\
    \ basic principles that will provide to become increasingly productive and sustainable,\
    \ building a \nproduction system that works in favour of the ecosystem, satisfying\
    \ human needs to achieve 2030 SDG targets. FAO’s five basic \nprinciples are:\
    \ (1) Increasing productivity, employment, and value addition in food systems,\
    \ (2) Protecting and enhancing natural \nresources, (3) Improving livelihoods\
    \ and fostering inclusive economic growth, (4) Enhancing the resilience of people,\
    \ \ncommunities, and ecosystems, and (5) Adapting governance to new challenges\
    \ (FAO 2018). \n \nMoreover, the 20 practical and interconnected actions integrated\
    \ by FAO (2018) are prepared for decision-makers to provide \ntransformations\
    \ related to the 2030 Agenda SDGs. \n \nThe 2030 SDGs comprise the aims related\
    \ to food (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), climate change (SDG 13), and\
    \ \necosystem (SDG 15). Policies and programs managers to be developed by managers\
    \ will sign managing of resources in future \nin the way a more sustainable one.\
    \ Nevertheless, there are many operational difficulties. Holistic systematic analyses\
    \ are needed \nto obtain comprehensive solutions covering problems related to\
    \ the water-energy-food-climate. Future farming will be built on \nfour main pillars\
    \ are follows (1) Improving productivity, (2) Rational use of resources, (3) Adaptation\
    \ to climate change, and (4) \nAvoidance of food waste (FAO 2018). \n \n3.2. Water-Energy-Food\
    \ Nexus \n \nEnergy, water and food security have been identified as three of\
    \ the key resources in achieving the United Nations' sustainable \ndevelopment\
    \ goals (Babatunde et al. 2019). Therefore, the water-energy-food nexus has been\
    \ proposed as a conceptual tool for \nachieving sustainable development. Many\
    \ developing countries has faced many challenges to meet the demands increasing\
    \ for \nhealthy food, clean water and green energy due to the climate change.\
    \ An effective solution can only be achieved through \nsustainable use of vital\
    \ resources such as land, water, and energy (Rasul & Sharma 2016). \n \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n          377 \n \nWater, energy, and food are resources that\
    \ are unavoidably connected with each other. Impacts on only one resource can\
    \ also \ncause changes in the other ones. The increasing global population, energy\
    \ demands, freshwater resources, and food supply \nemphasize the significance\
    \ of this topic. The Water-Food-Energy (WEF) Nexus concept was introduced by Hoff\
    \ in the World \nEconomic Forum held in the Bonn in 2011 to take measures pointing\
    \ out the problems the world may face and to address the \nlinks between water\
    \ and economic development (Hoﬀ 2011). In recent years, the WEF nexus has become\
    \ an independent \ntechnical term due to its growing popularity. The interdependent\
    \ and complex interactions of these three basic resources are \ncalled as the\
    \ water-energy-food nexus (Zhang and Vesselinov 2016; Bieber et al. 2018). Solutions\
    \ of challenges concerning food, \nwater, and energy have to be planned to meet\
    \ current and future socio-economic demands at local, regional, national, and\
    \ global \nscales for sustainable development (Bazilian et al. 2011; FAO 2014;\
    \ Howells et al. 2013; IRENA 2015; Cevher 2019; Namany \net al. 2021). Figure\
    \ 3 shows connections water-energy-food nexus, interactions among WEF. \n \nThere\
    \ are technological solutions based on nexus models for rural and urban fields\
    \ (Lehmann 2018), sensor applications \n(Abegaz et al. 2018), renewable energy\
    \ (IRENA 2015), and greenhouse monitoring (Asolkar & Bhadade 2015). Moreover,\
    \ if \nknowing the interconnections between the three elements of the Nexus, it\
    \ can be determined which resource should be shared in \nwhat proportion for sustainable\
    \ production, how taking temporal and spatial strategical decisions. (Tian et\
    \ al. 2018; Zhang et al. \n2018; Ravar et al. 2020, Norouzi & Kalantari 2020;\
    \ Keyhanpour et al. 2021; Yue et al. 2021). \n \n \n \nFigure 3- Water-energy-food\
    \ nexus, interactions among WEF (modified from Bieber 2018). \n \n3.3. Digital\
    \ Transformation  \n \nAccording to FAO and World Bank reports, digital transformation\
    \ can be used to solve challenges that are faced in agriculture \nand in rural\
    \ areas (WB 2019; Trendov et al. 2019). Thanks to a well-planned transition towards\
    \ smart farming (Klerkx & Rose \n2020), this transformation can contribute to\
    \ agri-food systems (Klerkx and Begemann 2020). Digital transformation is a concept\
    \ \nthat defines the process of finding solutions to social and sectoral needs\
    \ with the integration of digital technologies, and \naccordingly the development\
    \ and change of workflows and culture (ElMassaha & Mohieldin 2020). Digitalization\
    \ is defined as \nthe socio-technical process providing with using digital innovations.\
    \ In the agricultural sector, numerous notions have emerged \nto define different\
    \ forms of digitalization in agri-food production systems (Klerkx et al. 2019).\
    \  \n \nThese are Precision Farming (McBratney et al. 2005; Aubert et al. 2012;\
    \ Eastwood et al. 2017), Smart Farming (Wolfert et \nal. 2017), Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (Rose & Chilvers 2018; De Clercq et al. 2018; Zambon et al. 2019; Zhai et al.\
    \ 2020; Raj et al. 2021; \nRijswijk et al. 2021; Rose et al. 2021). Moreover,\
    \ synonyms of Agriculture 4.0 are “Numerical Agriculture” (Agriculture \nNumérique)\
    \ in France (Klerkx et al. 2019), “Smart Farming” in many countries of the European\
    \ Union, “Digital Agriculture” in \nAustralia and New Zealand (Keogh & Henry 2016;\
    \ Shepherd et al. 2018; Fielke et al. 2020; Fleming et al. 2021). These concepts\
    \ \nhave defined as the \"Digital Agricultural Revolution\" by Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO) (Trendov et al. 2019) \n \nAccording to CEMA (2018), Digital\
    \ Farming is the transformation from Precision Farming to end to end connectable,\
    \ \nknowledge-based farm production systems. CEMA explains that Digital Farming\
    \ has a similar structure to Industry 4.0. \nHowever, there are many aspects of\
    \ production parameters in agriculture that are different from industry. Agriculture\
    \ is mostly \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n378 \n \ndefined with environmental and biological\
    \ factors, and therefore its physical specifications should be basically considered\
    \ \n(CEMA 2017a; 2017b). \n \nLioutas et al. (2021) presented the beneficial and\
    \ negative aspects of digitalization. They also indicated the necessity to \n\
    develop new approaches based on science in terms of societal impacts in the evolution\
    \ of digital agriculture. \n \nPylianidis et al. (2021) reported a review on digital\
    \ twins in agriculture in the period 2017-2020. They defined the unique \ncharacteristics\
    \ of agricultural digital twins and pointed out that digitalization will provide\
    \ multiple gains in terms of productivity \nand sustainability to the agricultural\
    \ sector.  \n \nFielke et al. (2019) explained that more comprehensive effects\
    \ due to agricultural innovation and digitalization and pointed \nout that the\
    \ main themes covering socio-technical dimensions of digitalization in agricultural\
    \ production practices are \nconnectivity, transparency, and governance. \n \n\
    Four key technologies that will be an active role in the future of digital farming\
    \ are (1) vision and sensors, (2) automation \nand robotics (3) digitization and\
    \ big data, (4) biological actors. At the heart of all these key technologies\
    \ is the achievement of \nhigh efficiency in connectivity (Berger 2019). \n \n\
    3.3.1. Connectivity \n \nAgricultural digital transformation is one of the topics\
    \ that have political priority on a global scale (WB 2017; WB 2019; Trendov \n\
    et al. 2019). According to the European Commission Report (EC 2017), one of the\
    \ targets of the EU is to connect farmers end \nto end to the digital economy\
    \ to succeed in the sustainable evolving of food and farming.  \n \nThe digital\
    \ connectivity in agricultural knowledge networks and agro-food value exchange\
    \ will increase using novel tools \nsuch as digital hardware and software (Fielke\
    \ et al. 2019). As shown in Figure 4, all three of these technologies-sensors,\
    \ robotic \nautomation, and digital data work together and are enabled by adequate\
    \ connectivity as well as advances in edge computing and \nthe cloud. At the heart\
    \ of all these key technologies is the achievement of high efficiency in connectivity\
    \ (Berger 2019). \n \n \n \nFigure 4- Four key technology levers to drive improvements\
    \ to the farm economy and shape a new agricultural \necosystem - Agricultural\
    \ industry technology map (Berger 2019) \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          379 \n\
    \ \n3.3.2. Transparency \n \nTransparency in agricultural practices is important\
    \ for all stakeholders in the agricultural sector including consumers, and \n\
    regulators, in terms of deep connectivity and informational interaction between\
    \ them (Fielke et al. 2019). Agricultural knowledge \nand advice networks digitalized\
    \ will be crucial in terms of the transformation of agricultural innovation (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \nDigital information flows transfer with transparency to everywhere\
    \ will provide trust between farmers themselves and \ninteractions with technologies\
    \ (Kelton et al. 2008; Sligo & Massey 2007). Transparency is need due to providing\
    \ informational \ninteraction with extensive connectivity between them (Wolfert\
    \ et al. 2017). \n \n3.3.3. Governance \n \nIt is known that challenges appear\
    \ in balancing the priorities in terms of sustainable development in the agriculture\
    \ sector as \nagri-food systems digitalize. In order to solve these, planning\
    \ between public and private organizations will require (Carolan \n2018; Regan\
    \ 2019), considering socio-ethical factors to meet public and private goals in\
    \ the agricultural sector (Fielke et al. \n2019). Past experiences in agricultural\
    \ decision support systems have seen that without the contributions of all stakeholders\
    \ in \nthe agricultural sector including social systems it will not be a sufficient\
    \ solution (Fielke et al. 2018; Klerkx et al. 2017). \n \n4. Smart Farming \n\
    \ \nImprovements in both hardware and software technology open a new chapter in\
    \ agriculture, especially when it comes to sensors, \nbiologicals, robotic & automation,\
    \ and digital data. PA is a part of smart farming technologies including agricultural\
    \ \nmanagement, information systems, and automation and robotics (Balafoutis et\
    \ al. 2020; Klerkx et al. 2019; Rose & Chilvers \n2018). \n \n4.1. Precision Agriculture\
    \  \n \nPA is the management of spatial and temporal variability through using\
    \ advanced technologies to precisely match agricultural \ninputs to increase economic\
    \ gains and lessen environmental impacts. \n \nPA not only offers solutions to\
    \ address many of the problems posed, exacerbated and exposed by this global crisis,\
    \ it also \nhas the potential to be an invaluable tool for rebuilding and strengthening\
    \ the efficient and sustainable food systems of tomorrow. \nPrior to PA, farmers\
    \ homogeneously managed their inputs such as seed, fertilizer, pesticide and irrigation\
    \ despite existing within-\nfield variability in soil properties, crop stress\
    \ and crop yield. Beginning in the 1990s, after the emergence of PA, farmers were\
    \ \nable to divide their heterogeneous areas into smaller units that were relatively\
    \ homogeneous. Knowing all the historical data of \nan area can help growers adopt\
    \ a PA approach and adjust their input to benefit their land, increase profitability\
    \ and reduce their \noverall environmental impact. PA offers the use of satellite\
    \ technologies that allow real-time management of crops, fields and \nanimals\
    \ (Talepbour et al. 2015).  \n \nIn the light of the developments it has shown\
    \ from the emergence of PA to the present day, it develops agricultural \nmanagement\
    \ by making use of various perspectives. These perspectives are listed below.\
    \ \n \na) Agronomic perspective: considering the real needs of the crop in the\
    \ regulation of cultural practices (for example; better \nfertilization management).\
    \ \nb) Technical perspective: establishing better time management at farm level\
    \ (for example; planning of agricultural activities). \nc) Environmental perspective:\
    \ reducing agricultural effects (to more accurately estimate the soil's need for\
    \ nitrogen to limit \nnitrogen flow). \nd) Economic perspective: increasing productivity\
    \ or reducing the amount of input, increasing the efficiency of the yield (for\
    \ \nexample; making nitrogen fertilization application at low cost). \n \nRecently,\
    \ various technologies related to PA have developed technologies like GPS systems,\
    \ yield mapping, smart sensors, \nand automatic steering systems. As expected,\
    \ these systems were developed for the farmer to increase yields, save nutrients\
    \ and \nso as to make efficient sensing and decision support systems that can\
    \ increase profitability on the farm and reduce negative \nenvironmental impact.\
    \ PA supports reduced tillage and other cost and labor-saving novel technologies.\
    \ Along with the latest \ndevelopments in semi-autonomous systems and agricultural\
    \ robots in this process, it seems that the process has accelerated \namong farmers.\
    \ Figure 5 shows the connections between different technical systems and sensors,\
    \ especially from geolocation \nand sensing systems to decision support, variable-rate\
    \ operation, and route planning among emerging technologies in PA \n(Pedersen\
    \ 2017). \n \nFrontier technologies used in PA for long time have four main phases\
    \ that span almost all agricultural applications. These \nfour main stages and\
    \ related technologies (Balafoutis et al. 2020); \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    380 \n \n1. Guidance technologies- These include all types of automatic guidance\
    \ for tractors and self-propelled agricultural \nmachinery such as driver assistance,\
    \ controlled traffic in agriculture, developed based on hardware and software.\
    \ \n2. Information management- Measurement is essential for accurate farming and\
    \ better control results. Measurement systems \nconsist of sensors that can be\
    \ mounted on ground-based stations and attached to aerial or satellite platforms.\
    \ They collect \nspatial information including soil mapping, canopy mapping, and\
    \ yield mapping, also soil moisture mapping. Knowledge \nmanagement will enable\
    \ farmers to perform PA more efficiently and comfortably. If the connection between\
    \ the digital \nand the physical farm is not made right, there can always be a\
    \ shortage of precision farming among farmers. \n3. Application technologies-\
    \ These involve technologies such as variable rate irrigation and variable rate\
    \ application \ntechnologies for nutrients, crop protection agents, irrigation,\
    \ seeding, and precision weed control, developed based on \nhardware and software.\
    \ \n4. Data analysis technologies- These are used for the analysis of data gathered\
    \ through data collection. Related technologies \nare: \n \n- Management zone\
    \ definition \n- Decision support systems (DSS) \n- Farm management information\
    \ systems (FMS) \n \n \n \nFigure 5- Major digital systems used in precision agriculture\
    \ (Pedersen 2017) \n \nInternational experiences and survey studies show that\
    \ Aided Steering Systems (ASS) tend to be the first technologies \nadopted by\
    \ farmers, due to their relative simplicity and the tangible benefits in terms\
    \ of reduced fuel consumption and inputs as \nwell as increased labour productivity\
    \ (less driver fatigue, working during night, etc.) (Say et al. 2017). Recording\
    \ technologies \nare increasingly available through remote sensing from satellites\
    \ and drones even though their use by individual farmers is still \nlimited. Field\
    \ sensors are increasingly being deployed in higher value crops such as orchards\
    \ and vegetables but also in field \ncrops, to support irrigation management and\
    \ for early warning of diseases. Reacting technologies such as VRAs (Variable\
    \ Rate \nApplications) are being adopted more slowly, as they are most complex\
    \ requiring proper recording technologies as well as \nsufficient intra-field\
    \ heterogeneity to be profitable for farmers. Evidence in Turkey suggests a similar\
    \ pattern: As such, farmers \nare less convinced about their profitability and\
    \ require more sensitization, training and support (Say et al. 2017). \n \nSatellite\
    \ technology has also shown significant progress for imaging applications among\
    \ PA technologies. For example, \nremote sensing (RS) is used successfully to\
    \ detect variability in soil and crop conditions and to match inputs such as water,\
    \ seed, \nand fertilizer via variable rate technology. Currently, satellite imaging\
    \ technology is more suitable for large areas due to its cost \neffectiveness\
    \ in comparison to drone-based imaging. However, with a number of high-precision\
    \ satellite launches being planned, \nthat precision capabilities will improve\
    \ significantly to enable usage for medium-sized and small fields. \n \nDrone-based\
    \ imaging in PA has evolved rapidly over the last few years. Current drone imaging\
    \ favours usage of smaller \nfarms where satellite imagery is not cost effective.\
    \ With the improvements in satellite technology described above, however, \ndrone-based\
    \ imaging may be limited to certain conditions such as heavy cloud cover or difficult\
    \ terrain. With regards to precision \nspraying, however, drones may prove to\
    \ be a significant advantage as payload capacity continues to increase. \n \n\
    Lastly, farm management systems are another interesting and developing area in\
    \ the PA ecosystem. They assist farmers and \nland managers in achieving higher\
    \ yields and less waste through smarter resource management and greater reduction\
    \ of input \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          381 \n \ncosts. Current farm management\
    \ systems use predictive algorithms to issue warnings on imminent pest attacks\
    \ and other key \nrisks affecting farm productivity. \n \n4.2. Agriculture 4.0\
    \  \n \nThe agricultural sector sets sail towards a new era of agriculture called\
    \ “Agriculture 4.0” thanks to emerging novel digital \ntechnologies. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 finds solution to agricultural and environmental problems thanks to digitalization,\
    \ automation, and \nartificial intelligence adjusted to various agricultural technologies\
    \ from crop and livestock production, to weeding, to pest control, \nand also\
    \ to harvest.  \n \nMost studies related to new digital technologies are carried\
    \ out on topics, such as Information and Communications \nTechnologies (ICT),\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC) Big Data Analytics (BDA), robotics,\
    \ Machine Learning \n(ML), Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles \n(UGVs), and Blockchain. There\
    \ are many literatures covering various applications used in Agriculture 4.0 in\
    \ the past few years:  \nICT (Lezoche et al. 2020; Moysiadis et al. 2021); WSN\

    2019). Furthermore, other smart farming topics including 3D Printing, Synthetic\
    \ Biology, Gene Editing, Nano Materials have \nbeen researched by GHD & AgThentic\
    \ (2018). \n \nNonetheless, Agriculture 4.0 paradigm occurs five core technologies\
    \ covering sensors and robotics, Internet of Things, cloud \ncomputing, data analytics,\
    \ decision support system. Figure 6 shows core technologies and connections among\
    \ them. (1) Sensors \nand robotics fulfill sensing and actuating functions, according\
    \ to the needs of the system. (2) IoT provides connectivity based on \nprotocol\
    \ and network for data communication. (3) Cloud computing is responsible for data\
    \ storage and processing. (4) Data \nanalytics involves big data and AI and ML-based\
    \ algorithms for data analysis. (5) Decision support system helps to provide data\
    \ \nvisualization, guidance functions, and user interaction (Araújo et al. 2021).\

    \ is a term describing the continuous increase in data, and the technologies needed\
    \ to collect, store, manage and \nanalyze it. It is a complex and multidimensional\
    \ phenomenon, impacting people, processes, and technology. Big Data is usually\
    \ \ncharacterized by \"four Vs \": Volume (size of the data sets), Velocity (high\
    \ speed of data processing), Variety (different types \nand sources of data used),\
    \ and Veracity (high quality of analyzed data). \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a term used to define machines achieving human-like cognitive functions such\
    \ as learning, \nunderstanding, reasoning, or interacting. It comprises different\
    \ forms of cognition and meaning understanding (e.g. Speech \nrecognition, Natural\
    \ Language processing) and human interaction (e.g. signal sensing, smart control,\
    \ simulators). In terms of its \ntechnology base AI is a very heterogeneous field.\
    \ While some aspects like sensors, chips, robots as well as certain applications\
    \ \nlike autonomous driving, logistics, or medical instruments refer to hardware\
    \ components, a relevant part of AI is rooted in \nalgorithms and software.  \n\
    \ \nAgricultural robots can be used for crop monitoring and plant phenotyping,\
    \ yield estimation, soil sampling, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, dairy milking,\
    \ sorting tasks, disease detection, weed and pest control, planting, harvesting,\
    \ environmental \nmonitoring and pruning. UAVs and UGVs are robots that are used\
    \ both in the air and on land for agricultural applications. \n \nBlockchain is\
    \ a shared, digital, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording\
    \ transactions and tracking assets in \na business network. Shared ledgers technology\
    \ allows new transactions to be added to an existing chain of transactions using\
    \ a \nsecure, digital or cryptographic signature. Assets can be tangible (house,\
    \ car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, \npatents, copyrights,\
    \ brand). Blockchain protocols aggregate, validate, and relay transactions within\
    \ the blockchain network. \nAlmost anything of value can be tracked and transacted\
    \ on a blockchain network, reducing risk and reducing all costs involved \nin\
    \ the business. Blockchain is ideal for presenting information as it provides\
    \ instantaneous, shared, and completely transparent \ninformation stored in a\
    \ non-modifiable ledger that can only be accessed by authorized network members.\
    \ A blockchain network \ncan track orders, payments, accounts, production, and\
    \ much more. As members share a single view of the truth, all the details of \n\
    a transaction can be seen from start to finish; thus, creating new efficiencies\
    \ and opportunities as well as greater confidence.  \n \nIndustrial Biotechnology\
    \ is the application domain of biotechnology for the industry in the production\
    \ and processing of \nchemicals, materials, and fuels. This technology involves\
    \ the practices related to using microorganisms or enzymes to generate \nindustrially\
    \ useful products in a more efficient way (e.g. less energy use, or fewer by-products)\
    \ without conventional \npetrochemical processes. \n \nNanotechnology is an umbrella\
    \ term that covers from the design to structural application and production, to\
    \ devices, and \nsystems by controlling shape and size at a nanometer scale. Nanotechnology\
    \ has revolutionary the potential for the development \nof smart nano and micro-devices\
    \ and systems in fields such as agriculture, healthcare, energy, environment,\
    \ and manufacturing. \nNanotechnology use in agriculture allows smart solutions\
    \ for nutrients, pesticides, and genetic materials for improved soil \nfertility\
    \ and soil protection, thanks to better stress tolerance. Nano-based sensors can\
    \ be used for monitoring whole factors that \naffect productivity in smart farming.\
    \ Moreover, nanotechnology can be used in post-harvest food processing and packaging\
    \ to \nreduce food contamination and waste. \n \nPhotonics is a multidisciplinary\
    \ field related to light including energy generation, detection, and process management,\
    \ \ndevices such as electronic components, and photodiodes, lasers, and LEDs.\
    \ It allows the technological basis for the economic \nconversion of sunlight\
    \ to electricity for solar-powered systems. \n \n4.2.2. Agriculture 4.0 applications\
    \ \n \nAgriculture 4.0 can be applied at four main groups as showed in Figure\
    \ 7: (a) monitoring; (b) control, (c) prediction, and (d) \nlogistics (Araújo\
    \ et al. 2021). \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim\

    \ Domains and applications in Agriculture 4.0 (Araújo et al. 2021) \n \nMonitoring-\
    \ Automatic monitoring is the first step to passing to Agriculture 4.0. Smart\
    \ monitoring systems have potential \nchanging the game rule thanks to real-time\
    \ data collected from the field and advanced data analytics tools providing the\
    \ success \nof agricultural management. Monitoring allows farmers to get smart\
    \ and fast decisions and perform timely interventions, to \nincrease productivity\
    \ in agriculture, save time and costs and protect the environment (Araújo et al.\
    \ 2021). \n \nMonitoring include usually applications as follows: \n \n- Weather\
    \ monitoring (air temperature and humidity, rainfall, wind direction, wind velocity,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, solar \nradiation, etc.).  \n- GHG monitoring (temperature,\
    \ GHG emissions- CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2).  \n- Crop monitoring (NDVI) and soil monitoring\
    \ (temperature, moisture, electrical conductivity, pH value, and nutrient content)\
    \ \nfor agricultural management.  \n- Water monitoring (temperature, conductivity,\
    \ pH, salinity, turbidity, specific chemical compounds, dissolved oxygen \ncontent)\
    \ for irrigation systems, aquaculture or aquaponics (aquaculture + hydroponics)\
    \ for management. \n \nControl- While information is managed in one way in the\
    \ monitoring applications, the control applications use a bidirectional \ninformation\
    \ line. Commonly, an IoT-control system works together automatic monitoring system,\
    \ which employs IoT sensors \nto collect necessary data and to transfer them for\
    \ storage and then processing. Control applications are the following (Araújo\
    \ et \nal. 2021): \n \n- Irrigation Systems (sensors, actuators such as water\
    \ pumps, and solenoid valves) for irrigation management.  \n- Fertilization and\
    \ Fertigation for optimum fertilization. \n- Weed, Pest and Disease Control for\
    \ many problems like a waste of chemicals, increased costs, and pest resistance\
    \ to \nchemicals, environmental pollution, and contamination of agricultural products.\
    \ \n \nPrediction- Predicting function in Agriculture 4.0 is used in decision-making\
    \ support for the optimization in the management \nprocess. Monitoring and documentation\
    \ are vital processes since it is used real-time and historical data to improve\
    \ exact \nanalytical methods in predicting actual events. Prediction applications\
    \ are the following (Araújo et al. 2021): \n \n- Forecasting Weather Conditions\
    \ \n- Crop Development and Yield Estimation  \n- Forecasting Market Demand \n\
    \ \nLogistics- It is known that, in recent years, consumers have been more concerned\
    \ about how the agri-food products bought \nare produced, handled, packaged, stored,\
    \ and distributed. Agriculture 4.0 provides more efficient management and transparency\
    \ \nby increasing efficiency in logistics, addressing food safety and security,\
    \ traceability and food authentication, decreasing intrinsic \nrisks, and complying\
    \ with certifications and regulations (Araújo et al. 2021). \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \nSeveral application examples related to domains such as monitoring, control,\
    \ prediction, and logistics of smart farming are given \nbelow. \n \nSmart Livestock\
    \ Farming (SLF) is one of applications of PA that supports real-time monitoring\
    \ of productions, health, and \nwelfare of livestock, and to ensure optimal yield,\
    \ to increase the management capacity of animals. A variety of sensors and \n\
    actuators and decision-making tools, and IoT technologies are used in SLF (Cadero\
    \ et al. 2018). Electronic identification systems \nsuch as ear tags, ruminal\
    \ boluses, and sub-cutaneous radio-frequency identification; on-animal sensors\
    \ like accelerometers, \nglobal positioning systems, and social activity loggers;\
    \ and stationary management systems, milking parlor, and related \ntechnologies\
    \ and flock management software are used in SLF (Vaintrub et al. 2021). Newton\
    \ et al. (2020) examined a case study \nrelated to the dairy milk recording system\
    \ under Australian conditions, using big data analytics based on individual cow\
    \ and herd \nperformance information, such as milk production, lactation, and\
    \ breeding records. They studied farm decision support using big \ndata and explored\
    \ various factors and processes along with farmer engagement. Knight (2020) reviewed\
    \ the current status of \nwearable sensor technologies in livestock farming that\
    \ could revolutionize dairy farming; explained the important difficulties, \n\
    and emphasized the advantages need for animal wellbeing, profitability. Sensors\
    \ are split into three categories: (1) \"At Cow\" \nsensors, (2) \"Near Cow\"\
    \ sensors, and (3) \"From Cow\" sensors. Wearable sensors can be placed by swallowing\
    \ or inserting into \ncows. Figure 8 shows wearable sensor technologies developed\
    \ for cows. While \"At Cow\" sensors at the red zone are used to \nmeasure acceleration,\
    \ temperature, heart rate, and pH, \"Near Cow\" sensors at the blue zone are used\
    \ to analyze video and sound \ninformation, as well as climate analysis, feed\
    \ analysis, and GPS, these are designed to be make interaction with the cloud.\
    \ \"From \nCow\" sensors at the green zone are employed to monitor products and\
    \ wastes like milk, hair, saliva, sweat, nasal secretion, \nbreath, and faeces\
    \ taken from the cow. Zhang et al. (2021) pointed out that SLF has important potential\
    \ thanks to intelligent \ntechnologies such as environmental control, disease\
    \ early warning, precise feeding, and remote diagnosis. They discussed the \n\
    framework and technical characteristics of wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT),\
    \ the advantages, difficulties, and expectations \nof the W-IoT in farm animals\
    \ (Figure 9). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8- Overview of sensor technologies associated\
    \ with dairy animals for cows (modified from Knight 2020) \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker\

    \ \n          385 \n \n \n \nFigure 9- Wearable IoT system for SLF (Zhang et al.\
    \ 2021) \n \nSmart greenhouses enable farmers to cultivate crops with minimum\
    \ human interference. Climatic conditions such as \ntemperature, humidity, luminosity,\
    \ and soil moisture are continuously monitored inside a greenhouse. Variations\
    \ in these \nconditions will trigger automated actions. These actions will then\
    \ evaluate the changes and implement corrective actions to \nmaintain optimal\
    \ conditions for plant growth. \n \nZamora-Izquierdo et al. (2019) proposed a\
    \ flexible platform for greenhouses that used soilless culture with full recirculation.\
    \ \nThe system that obtained saving of more than 30% in water consumption and\
    \ up to 80% in some nutrients has low-cost hardware \nand a three-tier open-source\
    \ software platform at local, edge, and cloud planes.   \n \nLiao et al. (2017)\
    \ developed an IoT-based system including three subsystems like environmental\
    \ monitoring system, a \nwireless imaging platform, and a host analysis platform,\
    \ shown in Figure 10. In an orchid greenhouse, environmental sensors \nthat measure\
    \ temperature, relative humidity, and illumination, and cameras capture the images\
    \ of orchids were used. The IoT-\nbased environmental monitoring system consists\
    \ of 12 WSN, and a gateway based on ZigBee. While WSNs are responsible for \n\
    measuring environmental parameters, the gateway is used to organize the sensor\
    \ readings sent by the WSNs and transmit them \nto the host via Wi-Fi. The IoT-based\
    \ wireless imaging platform is built upon a Raspberry Pi single-board computer\
    \ with cameras. \nSensor data and camera images are saved in the host platform.\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 10- Overall conceptual diagram of IoT-based monitoring system\
    \ for greenhouses (Liao et al. 2017) \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n386 \n \nLin et al.\
    \ (2020) developed a framework using a linear programming model maximizing economic\
    \ profits and environmental \nbenefits for the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization\
    \ system in which both long-term and short-term planning are considered as \n\
    illustrated in Figure 11. \n \n \n \nFigure 11- IoT-based smart fertigation management\
    \ system (Lin et al. 2020) \n \nRoy et al. (2021) designed an IoT system according\
    \ to a dynamic irrigation scheduling called \"AgriSens\" for efficient water \n\
    management of irrigated crop fields. The AgriSens enables real-time, automatic\
    \ irrigation, as well as remote manual irrigation \nfor different growth phases.\
    \ IoT helps not only enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes but also minimize\
    \ water losses. In \norder to calculate the precise needs for water, sensors that\
    \ measure various parameters, such as relative humidity, soil moisture, \ntemperature,\
    \ and light intensity, need. IoT-based smart irrigation systems with such a mechanism\
    \ can contribute to higher \nirrigation efficiency. Benyezza et al. (2021) proposed\
    \ a block diagram of the example irrigation system, which is composed of \nthree\
    \ main parts, as shown in Figure 12: data processing, cloud, and communication\
    \ part. \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          387 \n \n \n \nFigure 12- Block diagram\
    \ of the example irrigation system (Benyezza et al. 2021) \n \nChen et al. (2020)\
    \ proposed a framework called “blockchain-based electronic agriculture” on its\
    \ development and challenges \nof Ecological Farm in the Beijing Liuminying. According\
    \ to this framework, the whole circular agricultural model of the \necological\
    \ farm into the blockchain network automatically handles and uploads data through\
    \ several types of smart devices, \nwhich expands the information set that can\
    \ be used for sharing. This innovation provides a powerful agriculture model,\
    \ and \npresents a reliable path for reaching \"digital agricultural”. As shown\
    \ in Figure 13, Blockchain-based applications can be used \nalong with IoT smart\
    \ devices and drones to monitor agricultural environments (Bera et al. 2022).\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 13- Blockchain-IoT enabled agriculture using drones (Bera\
    \ et al. 2022) \n \nThe European Commission has set up large-scale projects to\
    \ initiate the digitization of agriculture in Europe with \napproximately €1 billion\
    \ of EU funding under the Horizon 2020 program (EC 2021b). Several examples of\
    \ these projects are \ngiven below: \n \nATLAS project is agricultural interoperability\
    \ & analysis system, also being an open digital service platform for agricultural\
    \ \napplications. The goal of ATLAS is the development of an open interoperability\
    \ network for agricultural applications and to \nbuild up a sustainable ecosystem\
    \ for innovative data-driven agriculture. The platform enables the flexible combination\
    \ of \nagricultural machinery, sensor systems, and data analysis tools to overcome\
    \ the lack of interoperability. This allows farmers to \nincrease their productivity\
    \ in a sustainable way. The ATLAS platform is built around a data exchange network\
    \ using a uniform \napplication program interface (ATLAS 2019). \n \nDayıoğlu\

    \ in the European food and farming industry both precision farming \nand smart\
    \ farming (IoF2020 2017). IoT-driven smart farming enables farmers to optimize\
    \ their operating tasks to boost crop \nyields and to reduce the costs of inputs\
    \ such as water, fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.  \n \nDEMETER project\
    \ is a large-scale deployment of farmer-driven, interoperable smart farming-IoT\
    \ based platforms, delivered \nthrough a series of 20 pilots across 18 countries\
    \ (15 EU countries). Involving 60 partners, DEMETER adopts a multi-actor \napproach\
    \ across the value chain (demand and supply), with 25 deployment sites, 6000 farmers\
    \ and over 38000 devices and \nsensors being deployed (DEMETER 2019). \n \nSome\
    \ of EU’s robotics projects are Vinbot, MARS, GRAPE, VINEROBOT, ROMI and Flourish\
    \ projects (Moysiadis et al. \n2021). Vinbot aimed operations crop monitoring\
    \ using devices like laser sensors, cameras and the navigation system that is\
    \ based \non a hybrid reactive/GPS (VINBOT 2017). MARS subproject was designed\
    \ for the development of a mobile agricultural robot, \nwhich had the ability\
    \ to cooperate and work in swarms (Figure 14a). GRAPE subproject targeted to develop\
    \ a UGV able to \nperform semi-autonomous vineyard monitoring and farming tasks\
    \ (Figure 14b). VINEROBOT aimed to develop a novel UGV \ncapable of monitoring\
    \ grape growth and factors like grape yield, vegetative growth, water stress,\
    \ and grape composition in \ncovering vineyard management (Figure 14c). ROMI project\
    \ is developed for a UGV performing tasks such as weeding, crop \nmonitoring,\
    \ and collecting specific information on any individual plant (ROMI 2020). Flourish\

    \ 2021) \n \n4.2.4. Digital transition and challenges \n \nAlthough the many gains\
    \ that the success of Agriculture 4.0 could lead, there are still various challenges\
    \ that need to be handled \nfor providing a successful digital transformation.\
    \ The main challenges to be considered in Agriculture 4.0 are split into five\
    \ main \nlevels. Those challenges are related to device, data, network, application,\
    \ and the system according to levels. Challenges at device \nlevels are usually\
    \ related to a harsh field environment, power consumption, and cost issues. Data\
    \ levels are mostly linked to \nquality, availability, privacy, integrity, and\
    \ interpretability issues. Facing at network levels are mostly network size, latency\
    \ and \nthroughput, transmission range, propagation losses, and interoperability\
    \ issues. Emerging of during applications are usually real-\ntime use, context-awareness,\
    \ cyber-security, modularity, and reliability problems. Problems that emerged\
    \ in the system are \nscalability, flexibility, robustness, complexity, affordability,\
    \ and continuous improvement issues (Araújo et al. 2021).  \n \nAs noted earlier\
    \ (besides the small scale of land and low level of mechanization), farmers face\
    \ significant challenges in the \ntransition to smart farming as they try to adopt\
    \ sensors, biologicals, robotic automation, and digital data from third-party\
    \ \nproviders. Farmers are traditionally conservative and adopt new technology\
    \ solely for its usefulness rather than its technological \nappeal. As a result,\
    \ compelling applications must be significantly deep to deal with the farmer's\
    \ specific situation, while also \nrelying on integrated solutions that make data\
    \ and insights easy and seamless. \n \nThere are two basic stages in smart farming\
    \ that should be taken into account for the transition: (1) The pre-processing\
    \ stage \nand (2) the post-processing stage. The pre-processing phase covers market\
    \ trends geographical conditions and soil properties of \nthe land, seeds choosing,\
    \ and the land preparation for the smart farming system. The post-processing stage\
    \ is employed machine \nvision techniques for disease and weed identification\
    \ while using smart technologies in irrigation and harvesting. For traditional\
    \ \nagricultural players, this transition is not easy. As the industry moves from\
    \ products to outcome-based solutions and worksite \noptimization, many organizations\
    \ face the conflict of traditional platform or product-based organizations versus\
    \ the needs of the \nfarmer and marketplace. As a result, smart farming is undergoing\
    \ a rapid transformation from both a product and a service \nperspective. Technological\
    \ disruptions, business model transformations, and organizational changes are\
    \ all creating an exciting \nbut challenging opportunity. \n \n5. Renewable Energy\
    \ and Environmental Technologies \n \nRenewable energy technologies have the potential\
    \ to provide synergy between water, energy, and food; and also, the optimum \n\
    mix is available for three sectors. Solar-based pumping solutions offer a cost-effective\
    \ alternative to the grid- or diesel-based \nirrigation pumps. Renewable energy\
    \ and rainwater harvesting technologies can be combined with a nexus system. Renewable\

    \ energy, wind energy, and bioenergy can be integrated into agriculture in villages\
    \ and cities.  If \ncoupling an energy storage system with renewable energy technologies,\
    \ the excess energy generated can be stored to use in the \nfuture. As an alternative\
    \ solution to the Nexus approach, new applications where photovoltaic panels are\
    \ combined can be used \nin field and horticulture, and aquaculture. \n \n5.1.\
    \ Agrivoltaics  \n \nAgrivoltaic systems are PV technologies installed at a certain\
    \ height from the ground, making it together integrating agriculture \nand solar\
    \ energy. Agrivoltaic systems can provide both preserve agricultural land and\
    \ advantage crop production by increasing \nwater use efficiency and decreasing\
    \ water stress (Agostini et al. 2021; Allardyce et al. 2017). Sun'Agri agrivoltaic\
    \ system driven \nby artificial intelligence in Piolenc provides the vines shaded\
    \ by the pivoting solar panels continue to grow and show a reduced \nneed for\
    \ water thanks to the reduction in evapotranspiration (pv magazine 2020). However,\
    \ these positive attributes need \ncomprehensive environmental and economic analysis\
    \ of agrivoltaic systems. Figure 15 shows various applications of agrivoltaic\
    \ \nsystems.  \n \n \n \nFigure 15- Agrivoltaic systems: (a, b) Agrovoltaics a\

    \ a concept emerged with combining electricity production and aquaculture. AquaPVs\
    \ floating on the \nwater body can lessen water losses preventing evaporation\
    \ by up to 70–85% due to covering the water. The aquavoltaics \ntechnology enables\
    \ electricity to be generated and aquaculture to be carried out in the same area,\
    \ and thus significantly improves \noverall productivity per unit area compared\
    \ to conventional land use. Several projects and studies are carried out to verify\
    \ positive \nand negative aspects in terms of ecosystem and the technical and\
    \ economic feasibility of dual-use in Aquavoltaics (Pringle et al. \n2017, Fraunhofer\
    \ 2021; Solaripedia 2021; PV TECH 2021). Figure 16 shows various applications\

    \ ecosystems pose, and also unbalanced \nwater use in all sectors a threat to\
    \ the health of animals and humans, so our future. \n \nA nexus approach based\
    \ on water-energy-food given in this study supports the transition to a green\
    \ economy to solve whole \nthose problems. The agricultural nexus planning combined\
    \ with digital technologies can be used to solve challenges related to \nwater,\
    \ energy, and food including the environment. In this context, topics including\
    \ overall agricultural management can be \nhandled for the environment (water,\

    \ conditions. Data-driven \nIoT systems are have monitoring and control functions\
    \ including reducing energy and fuel consumption, generating renewable \nenergy\
    \ on-site, and performing closed-loop measurements of carbon consumption and waste.\
    \ It is seen that IoT-powered smart \nservices and industry could account for\
    \ up to 10 percent carbon reduction by increasing efficiency and eliminating reliance\
    \ on \ndisposable materials in both the public and private sectors. \n \nMonitoring\
    \ systems can assist farmers in monitoring and improving the quality to avoid\
    \ degradation of soil. They allow for \nthe monitoring of a number of physical,\
    \ chemical, and biological properties such as texture, water-holding capacity,\
    \ and \nabsorption rate. Soil monitoring can help to minimize problems, such as\
    \ erosion, densification, salinization, acidification, and \npollution due to\
    \ toxic elements (Yurtseven et al. 2018). \n \nPesticides and several other agrochemicals\
    \ are used widely in agriculture. These chemicals that affect in way serious and\
    \ \npermanent ecological balance are harmful to human and animal welfare, causing\
    \ substantial damage to complete ecosystems. \nIoT-based smart devices, such as\
    \ WSNs, drones, robots, enable farmers to substantially decrease the use of pesticides.\
    \ Advanced \nIoT-based pests and insect control allow precise tracking, simulation,\
    \ disease prediction, and therefore is more efficient than \ntraditional pest\
    \ control calendars or prescripts (Raj et al. 2021). The IoT-based systems with\
    \ ML, DL, and image processing can \nbe used in preventing fruit diseases, diagnosing\
    \ and preventing infection in agricultural products. Studies have seen that chemical\
    \ \npollution can prevent using big data, AI, ML technologies. Wastewater from\
    \ industry can be used in agricultural production; \nWater polluted with heavy\
    \ metals threatens our food (paddy, greenhouse cultivation, fish production, etc.)\
    \ and our health. In \nrecent years, it is known that cancer and many diseases\
    \ that adversely affect the immune system are caused by excessive \nagricultural\
    \ spraying and industrial wastewater. Excessive use of pesticides in fields, vineyards,\
    \ gardens, and greenhouses \npollutes air, soil, and water resources. In other\
    \ words, excessive spraying, irrigation, fertilization harm the entire ecosystem\
    \ in \nan unsustainable way. All of this should be traced back to the source where\
    \ the problem started; all data should be forwarded to \nthe center and evaluated;\
    \ monitoring and control mechanisms should be developed. \n \nPA has not only\
    \ the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also having a positive\
    \ effect on-farm productivity and \nthe economy. These technologies cover whole\
    \ farming applications such as variable-rate spraying, irrigation planting, \n\
    fertilization, and weeding (Balofoutis et al. 2017). Both driver assistance (Machine\
    \ Guidance) and Variable Rate Technologies \n(VRT) contribute to climate change\
    \ mitigation by reducing fuel and input use at given yields. Based on a literature\
    \ review, the \nEU classifies GHG reduction potential of different Precision Agricultural\
    \ Technologies (PATs) as it follows (Table 1): \n \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\
    \ of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n\
    \          391 \n \nTable 1- Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction potential of different\

    \ (VRT) \n1 \nWeeding (Precision physical) \n1 \n \nVariable-rate nutrient application\
    \ has the highest GHG emission reduction potential amongst PA technologies, as\
    \ nitrogen \nfertilizer is the main source of N2O that is the most influential\
    \ GHG emitted from farming activities. Its impact on global warming \nis 298 times\
    \ higher than that of CO2 (Soto et al. 2019). Variable-rate irrigation has a dual\
    \ impact. (1) decreasing the energy need \nfor water pumping from the water source,\
    \ (2) reducing of the GHG emissions by applying the optimum irrigation scheduling.\
    \ \nOn the other hand, applications such as controlled traffic in agriculture,\
    \ machine guidance, VRT-pesticide use have GHG \nreduction potential. Moreover,\
    \ all-natural resources (water, air, soil) have threatened due to chemical contaminants,\
    \ \noverwatering, over-spraying, over-fertilizing. \n \n5.3.3. Water monitoring\
    \ \n \nWater Quality Index (WQI) that developed to measure water quality is determined\
    \ through different water quality parameters, \nsuch as pH, turbidity, temperature,\
    \ chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen\
    \ demand \n(BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), etc. (Ahmed et al. 2020).\
    \ Smart water management requires the integration of \nsystems and a complex of\
    \ measures to monitor, control and regulate the usage and quality of water resources\
    \ as well as maintain \nthe associated equipment (sensors, actuators, pipes, pumps,\
    \ etc.). Smart water systems based on the combination of the IoT, big \ndata,\
    \ and AI technologies can help stop water scarcity from happening and remove the\
    \ damage the incautious usage of water \nresources has already caused. \n \nIn\
    \ rural areas shown in Figure 18, solar-powered wireless air - water - soil monitoring\
    \ stations can be used to monitor \nenvironmental variables at vineyards, orchards,\
    \ fields, fish farms, greenhouses, basis on the energy - food - water nexus at\
    \ real-\ntime. \n \n \n \nFigure 18- Solar-powered wireless-weather-soil-water\

    \ in Africa, a large pivot system with a radius of 479 meters has used to irrigate\
    \ 50 hectares of desert. The fuel costs of \noperating this system are very high.\
    \ Water is being supplied through an artificial canal from the Nile. At this point,\
    \ Alfalfa is \ngrown as feeding hay and harvested 11 times each year with the\
    \ harvest season exceeding 300 days. Until 2013, a 135-kW diesel \ngenerator ran\
    \ 22 hours per day to power the system. An alternative power source had to be\
    \ found in this off-grid. Following \nfeasibility analysis, a solar-powered system,\
    \ using suitable pumps to replace the diesel-powered generator and AC pumps were\
    \ \ninstalled. While all motors required to move the pivot now are powered with\
    \ solar energy, the pivot speed is automatically \ncontrolled proportional to\
    \ water flow. Figure 19 shows solar-powered center pivot irrigation system that\
    \ is installed by Lorentz. \nIn 11 hours, the pivot completes one 360 degrees\
    \ turn, providing the required 3300 m³ of water per day for partial irrigation\
    \ \n(Lorentz 2014). This energy transformation not only no longer decreasing energy\
    \ costs, but also greatly reducing carbon \nemissions. \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal\

    \ \n \nFood security and sustainable agriculture are the two main objectives of\
    \ agriculture production process and these objectives can \nonly be achieved by\
    \ changing the farming practices from fossil-based energy generation to renewable\
    \ energy based farming. \nRenewable energy technologies to be able to use in farming\
    \ are solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and biomass \nenergy. IFES\
    \ is a farming system model designed to combine, intensify, and hence improve\
    \ the simultaneous production of food \nand energy through the sustainable use\
    \ of biomass; achieved in two ways: 1. Combining the production of food and fuel\
    \ feedstock \nDayıoğlu & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri\
    \ Dergisi), 2021, 27(4): 373-399 \n          393 \n \non the same land, e.g. inter-cropping,\
    \ agroforestry, or agro-pastoral systems, 2. Using the by-products/residues of\
    \ one production \nsystem i.e. ‘closed loop’ or ‘zero waste’ systems. Hence, energy-smart\
    \ solutions can include simultaneously producing food and \nenergy as a means\
    \ of achieving sustainable production systems in rural communities as shown in\
    \ Figure 21 (Sims & Flammini \n2014). \n \n \n \nFigure 21- Integrated food energy\
    \ system (IFES) (Sims & Flammini 2014) \n \n6. Discussion \n \nIn this review,\
    \ innovative digital technologies to be able to use in agri-food systems are discussed\
    \ based on the water-energy-\nfood nexus for sustainable development. The agriculture\
    \ sector has a social-economic structure that is always a risky sector, \nwhere\
    \ variable inputs are used to grow very different products such as food and feed,\
    \ directly affected by weather conditions. \nAgricultural activities, unlike industry,\
    \ are carried out in large, open areas like fields, vineyards, and orchards, or\
    \ closed areas \nlike greenhouses, barns, poultry houses, and mushroom houses.\
    \ Today, it is necessary to switch from labor-intensive production \nto technology-intensive\
    \ production for successful and sustainable agricultural production in all its\
    \ processes.  \n \nSince the areas used in agricultural production are limited,\
    \ a productivity increase in agricultural production should be \nensured. While\
    \ input costs can be reduced, production yield and quality can be increased using\
    \ precision farming (Berger 2019; \nWolfert et al. 2017) and smart farming (Balafoutis\
    \ et al. 2019; Boursianis et al. 2019) technologies with variable rate applications,\
    \ \ndeveloped applications saving the environment. \n \nThe driving factor of\
    \ smart agriculture is to meet the demand for more food to increase yields, optimize\
    \ interdependent \nresources of energy, water, and land, and provide sustainable\
    \ urbanization. Water and energy are two finite resources that must \nreach access\
    \ to more people and so ensuring everyone has access to a reliable supply are\
    \ crucial to human survival and sustainable \ndevelopment (EC 2017; FAO 2017a;\
    \ WB 2019). \n \nThe agri-food value chain consumes 30 percent of the world’s\
    \ available energy (FAO 2020). Energy is needed in the \nproduction of crops,\
    \ fish, livestock, and forestry products, food storage and processing, food transport\
    \ and distribution and, as \nwell as, in food preparation (FAO 2012). Although\
    \ the availability of fossil fuels has made a significant contribution to feeding\
    \ \nthe world, these energy sources are finite and, in general, environmentally\
    \ problematic. As discussed also in this study, renewable \nenergy technologies\
    \ are key to food security and a climate-friendly, sustainable transformation\
    \ of agri-food systems to produce \nmore and better-quality food. Data-driven\
    \ systems, IoT-backed sensors keep an eye on consumption patterns and provide\
    \ insights \ninto inefficient areas which in turn help to analyze energy consumption,\
    \ usage, and pattern. These solutions can be utilized to \nmanage and optimize\
    \ energy consumption patterns by taking complete control of energy data at the\
    \ most fundamental and \ngranular level.  \n \nFAO supports digital technologies,\
    \ innovative ideas with high potential for impact in food and agriculture, for\
    \ transforming \ndigital solutions and services into global public goods. FAO\
    \ aims to explore the responsible application and adoption of existing \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n394 \n \nand frontier technologies, design and new services,\
    \ tools and approaches to empower rural households and inspire youth \nentrepreneurship\
    \ in food and agriculture (Santos Valle & Kienzle 2020). \n \nThe farming sector\
    \ is moving towards a new paradigm that is recalled Agriculture 4.0 that integrates\
    \ a number of innovations \nin order to produce agricultural products. Agriculture\
    \ has become a strategic sector that needs to be given more importance due \n\
    to reasons such as climate imbalances caused by global warming, an increase in\
    \ the world population, and the gradual decrease \nof usable agricultural resources.\
    \ Today, when traditional farming methods are no longer sufficient, countries\
    \ have to focus on \npractices that increase productivity and reduce costs with\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 practices. Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is used \nto\
    \ point out the digitalization of production as in Industry 4.0. Indeed, modern\
    \ technology is available that will make agriculture \nmore environmentally friendly\
    \ and efficient. Technical improvements in the agriculture sector can be carried\
    \ out to optimize \nproduction efficiency, and improve quality, minimize carbon\
    \ footprint; and can be reduced production-associated risks. \n \nAgricultural\
    \ applications that are from crop production to harvesting, from weather monitoring\
    \ to prediction, irrigation, \nweeding, fertigation, pest control, and logistics\
    \ are rapidly evolving towards a new digital cosmos covering technologies such\
    \ as \nIoT, cloud computing, big data, automation, and artificial intelligence.\
    \ \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nThis study targets to obtain holistic solutions in\
    \ a systematic view, basis on Water-Energy-Food nexus to agricultural digital\
    \ \ntransformation that will support achieving a sustainable future. Digitalization\
    \ is a technology accessing unexploited data pools \nto valuable information,\
    \ providing transformation to potential benefits for society and the environment\
    \ if programming smartly \nand efficiently among data sets.  \n \nThe water-food-energy\
    \ resources are at the center of sustainable development. The development of smart\
    \ systems \ninterconnected can generate unique opportunities to effectively solve\
    \ the challenges targeted in United Nations’ Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.\
    \ It can be emphasized that smart technologies can be able to use as tools for\
    \ game-rule changing, if setting \ntheir systematic integrations, the food-water-energy\
    \ nexus will benefit sustainable development. The strategical use of three \n\
    essential sources for future generations will provide invaluable solutions listed\
    \ here: (1) sustainable food production; (2) access \nto fresh and safe water;\
    \ and (3) renewable energy generation and usage. Human beings have two inevitable\
    \ missions to fulfill \nsustainable development. The first one is to solve the\
    \ interconnections between food - water - energy - climate nexus. The second \n\
    one is to develop smarter machines and systems achieving agricultural transformation\
    \ from traditional to digital to improve \nefficiency, decrease input costs and\
    \ resource use, and protect the environment. \n \nIn the new digital era starting\
    \ with the Industry 4.0 revolution, the production capabilities of all industries\
    \ thanks to \ninnovations emerged, including agriculture will have to transform\
    \ in order to feed the rapidly growing population of the world.  \n \nSmart agriculture\
    \ is real-time farm management providing a high degree of automation, and data-driven\
    \ intelligent decision-\nmaking to improve productivity, save natural resources.\
    \ Digital technologies can support farmers' production of safe, sustainable, \n\
    and quality food.  Technological innovations can help us overwhelm many of the\
    \ economic, social, and environmental challenges \nthat agriculture is facing\
    \ today. Novel technologies like the internet of things, cloud computing, big\
    \ data, artificial intelligence, \ndrones, and robotics provide making processes\
    \ more efficient and drive the creation of new products and services and streamline\
    \ \nagricultural operations. \n \nThe driven technology of Agriculture 4.0 is\
    \ the IoT that provides the ability to securely connect end-to-end to anything,\
    \ to \nanywhere. In IoT, numerous wireless sensor network deployed to the field\
    \ can be used along with cloud technologies. Big data \ngathered site-specific\
    \ are transformed into meaningful data set to be used in decision support systems\
    \ for smart applications. The \ncaptured information in the field can be examined\
    \ by computational techniques to reveal trends and patterns, and interactive \n\
    information on human behaviors, environment, and experiences can be transformed\
    \ into efficient actions.  \n \nBy using smart agriculture technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques, it will be possible to monitor in real-time how water, \nchemicals,\
    \ and energy are used for the production of healthy food and animal feed, and\
    \ what environmental effects the applied \nagricultural activity may cause. However,\
    \ this requires the development of national and international policies, the implementation\
    \ \nof strategies, and the control and supervision of processes.  \n \nDeveloped,\
    \ there are many smart farming technologies including decision support system,\
    \ yield monitoring, smart irrigation, \nsmart spraying, management of crop disease,\
    \ crop monitoring, soil monitoring, treatment of pests with robots, intelligent\
    \ \nharvesting according to maturity, traceability from farm to fork, logistics,\
    \ as well as e-marketing. Although innovation is often \nconceived as techno-centric,\
    \ the rise of Agriculture 4.0 thinking needs to consider also environmental and\
    \ social sustainability \nperspectives. However, challenges related to power,\
    \ performance, and security are obstacles to seamless connectivity.  \n \nThanks\
    \ to developments in recent years, it is seen that digital technologies and data-driven\
    \ techniques have the potential to \ntransform agriculture more precisely, efficiently,\
    \ and sustainably. Furthermore, while providing greater transparency for \nDayıoğlu\
    \ & Türker - Journal of Agricultural Sciences (Tarim Bilimleri Dergisi), 2021,\
    \ 27(4): 373-399 \n          395 \n \nconsumers on how food is produced, decision-making\
    \ support has helped farmers in many practices, in terms of environmental \nand\
    \ agricultural performance. Beyond farming, while digital technologies make the\
    \ job more attractive to new generations, they \noffer many opportunities to reduce\
    \ problems related to remoteness and improve access to services. \n \nAlthough\
    \ data-driven technologies play a key role at all stages of the production of\
    \ food and feed in agri-food systems of the \nfuture, none of this can happen\
    \ without enough energy and water from farm to fork. Being clean and sustainable\
    \ the energy used \nin agriculture, not chemically polluted of the water is vital\
    \ to access to fresh water and clean energy everyone, and for a better \nreconstructing\

    \ a doubt, agriculture is the most important source of\nlivelihood in Bangladesh.\
    \ As the world’s population expands,\nincreased agricultural output is essential.\
    \ The amount of\nfresh water and appropriate fertilizer used in irrigation must\n\
    be raised in order to maintain enhanced farm productivity.\nUnintentional water\
    \ waste happens when water consumption\nis not planned. Choosing the right fertilizer\
    \ for a particular\nfarmland is likewise a difficult challenge for our farmers.\n\
    This demonstrates the urgent need for alternatives to reduce\nwater waste and\
    \ appropriate fertilizer choices without placing\nfarmers under stress. In the\
    \ Electronic age, agriculture is rapidly\nbecoming a data-intensive sector, with\
    \ farmers collecting and\nanalyzing massive amounts of data from various sources\
    \ (e.g.,\nsensors, farming machinery, etc.) to obtain vital information\nand become\
    \ more efficient in production. Technology nowadays\nhas advanced a lot. With\
    \ the help of Machine Learning and\nIoT devices, a drastic change can be made\
    \ possible in the\nagricultural industry [1].\nWith the release of open-source\
    \ Arduino devices and the\navailability of different sensors, it is now possible\
    \ to build\ndevices that can monitor soil moisture content and irrigate\nfields\
    \ or landscapes as needed. Machine learning algorithms\nare used to assess various\
    \ agricultural data and may readily\nforecast which decisions should be made to\
    \ improve farmland\nproductivity. In comparison to their previous farming ways,\n\
    the farmer may easily combine ML and IoT into their farming\nand create an automated\
    \ system that is more time effective\nand less risky. Here, Fig. 1 depicts the\
    \ difference between the\ntraditional system with the ML-based agricultural framework.\n\
    Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) technologies have a\nmajor challenge with limited\
    \ energy. Many research in WSNs\nhas also been focused on reliable energy supply\
    \ to extend\nthe survival time of limited power sources in a network [2].\nEnergy\
    \ harvesting techniques are used to overcome the energy-\nscarcity problem of\
    \ WSNs. Energy harvesting is a process in\nwhich energy is obtained from the environment\
    \ as renewable\nenergy sources like solar radiation, Radio Frequency (RF),\nwind,\
    \ geothermal, electromagnetic (EM) waves, hydro, etc.,\nand is stored effectively\
    \ for driving various applications systems\nwhich may include wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSNs) [3] [4].\nTherefore, it can be used to operate the devices of\
    \ the embedded\nsystem for a reliable energy supply.\nSecurity is one of the most\
    \ critical aspects of IoT, as it\ndeals with the protection of data and devices\
    \ from unauthorized\naccess, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction\n\
    [5]. Encryption mechanisms are mostly used to ensure that\ndata is securely transmitted.\
    \ But, regularly used encryption\nalgorithms such as DES, AES, and RSA will be\
    \ heavy for small-\nscale embedded systems. Therefore, blockchain technology can\n\
    be used as a lightweight calculation technique to reliably operate\nand secure\
    \ an IoT system[6] [7].\nThis paper presents the latest IoT-ML-driven intelligent\
    \ agri-\ncultural management and provides a substantial new research\ndirection.\
    \ The central insight of this work is to offer possible\nsolutions to farming\
    \ hazards while providing a combined\nframework. Some significant contributions\
    \ of this paper are\noutlined as follows:\n•\nSmart Management: Traditional agricultural\
    \ manage-\nment is strengthened with edge-cutting technologies\n(i.e., IoT and\
    \ Machine Learning).\n•\nDistant Monitoring and Controlling: Farmers can\nmonitor\
    \ and control irrigation management from a\ndistance in terms of sensor-based\
    \ real-time data.\n•\nIntelligent Decision Making: Our machine learning\nmodel\
    \ provides substantial water control management\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n985 |\

    \ on the\ndata collected from the farming field.\n•\nBlock chain Based Security\
    \ System: Our proposed\nsolution uses blockchain technology to create a secure\n\
    and decentralized network that can ensure data integrity\nand protect data from\
    \ denial of service (DDoS) attacks,\nand man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n•\n\
    Energy Harvesting: To ensure a continuous energy\nsupply for the IoT system, we\
    \ have introduced energy\nharvesting technology which reduces the hassle for the\n\
    farmers of using extra batteries.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows:\
    \ Section II\nprovides an overview of existing works related to our proposed\n\
    framework. Section III provides a detailed description of the\nhardware that have\
    \ used in this research. Section IV discusses\nthe proposed IoT-ML-based smart\
    \ agricultural framework.\nSection V discusses the blockchain-based security of\
    \ our system.\nSection VI presents the real-life implementation of our project.\n\
    Next, Section VII illustrates and analyzes the experimental\nresult from our machine\
    \ learning models. Section VIII future\nresearch directions in this field of research.\
    \ Finally, Section IX\ngives a brief conclusion.\nII.\nRELATED RESEARCH\nSeveral\
    \ ML-IoT-based researches and project works on\nagriculture systems have been\
    \ carried out till today.\nIn [8], For remote sensing and smart agriculture, Ullo\
    \ et al.\npresented a review of research on the developments in smart\nsensors\
    \ and IoT. They put forth some suggestions for IoT\nadvancements that will support\
    \ researchers and agriculturalists\nin their work.\nIn [9], Samuel et al. analyzed\
    \ numerous techniques for crop\nselection, crop sowing, weed detection, and system\
    \ monitoring.\nThey have recommended different image processing methods\nfor weed\
    \ and leaf detection and evaluated the benefits and\ndrawbacks of each. Drone\
    \ implementation has been considered\nfor real-time monitoring and seed planting.\
    \ However, no actual\nimplementation is shown in this research; they have only\n\
    reviewed several smart agricultural strategies.\nIn [10], they analyze soil moisture\
    \ levels and apply auto\nirrigation to the crops. In order to eliminate the need\
    \ for human\ninvolvement, this system also senses temperature, humidity, and\n\
    the presence of impediments in the targeted region. These data\nare accessible\
    \ to the user via mobile from the cloud. By giving\nthe motor driver the command\
    \ YES/NO based on this data, the\nuser can control the operation of the motor.\n\
    In [11], they use a cloud-based architecture and the Internet\nof Things to examine\
    \ a smart irrigation system. This system\nis designed to measure soil moisture\
    \ and humidity and then\nprocess this data in the cloud using a variety of machine-\n\
    learning techniques. Farmers receive accurate information\nregarding water content\
    \ regulations. If farmers apply smart\nirrigation, they can reduce their water\
    \ usage.\nIn [12], they use IoT and machine learning to predict\nlate blight disease\
    \ in potatoes and tomatoes prior to the first\noccurrence. This will send farmers\
    \ a warning message on the\nprecise time to apply the protective pesticides.\n\
    In [13], for yield prediction, they present a hybrid ML\nmodel using IoT. They\
    \ use a two-tier ML approach named\naKNCN and ELM-mBOA.In the first tire, they\
    \ estimate soil\nquality and in the second tier, they predict the crop yield.\n\
    In agriculture, supply, and demand have always been crucial\nissues for sustainable\
    \ production management. To address\nand provide a possible solution to this problem,\
    \ M. Lee et\nal. proposed an IoT-based controlled agricultural production\nmanagement\
    \ [14]. The authors developed a decision support\nsystem to predict specific criteria\
    \ based on IoT-enabled sensor\ndata.\nA cloud-based real-time data analysis model\
    \ is proposed\nin [15] instead of dew-point humidity. In this regard, they\ndesigned\
    \ a CMM index measurement model to evaluate the\ncrops’ comfort level of relative\
    \ humidity levels.\nTo increase the crop production rate, real-time data analysis\n\
    based on an artificial model is proposed by Y. Zhou et al. in [16].\nThe current\
    \ innovation trend expects farmers to use IoT and\ntechnology to identify the\
    \ organization of those difficulties they\nface, such as water management deficiencies\
    \ in agriculture\nand productivity concerns. This research has attempted to\n\
    build dazzling agricultural cultivation patterns utilizing IoT\ntechnologies.\
    \ IoT has significantly improved agriculture by\nanalyzing various agricultural\
    \ difficulties and issues.\nAn IOT-based intelligent technology for agriculture\
    \ that can\nsense soils and environmental factors was proposed by Abhijith\nH.\
    \ V. et al. in [17]. In order to identify the urgent needs for\noptimal crop growth,\
    \ they applied data mining techniques to\nthe sensed data.\nAbraham et al. [18]\
    \ create a proof-of-concept farm surveil-\nlance system that employs IoT and deep\
    \ learning to identify\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n986 | P a g e\n(IJACSA) International\

    farm encroachment.\nThe purpose of the study Wongpatikaseree et al. [19], is\n\
    to propose a traceability system, summarizing and presenting\nobserved data from\
    \ the smart farm.\nFor smart farming, Deden Ardiansyah et al. [20] suggested\n\
    a WSN Server that can handle and optimize agricultural data.\nThey instantly store\
    \ the data in the database, which is afterward\nrepresented as a website and accessible\
    \ through the Internet\nnetwork.\nAutomation in agriculture is a basic need for\
    \ remote\ncontrol-based agricultural management to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment\
    \ in this field of research. In this regard, L.\nVijayaraja et al. proposed an\
    \ IoT-based monitoring system\nusing wireless communication networks in [21].\
    \ The power\nsupply management used in this framework is entirely from the\nrenewable\
    \ energy source that provides a cost-effective model\nfor sensor-based decision\
    \ management in intelligent farming.\nIn [22], Yaw-Wen Kuo, et al. presented a\
    \ Long-range IoT\nsystem where they developed four types of IoT units based on\n\
    Long-range technology. They employed pH, ORP, and EC in\nType A and water, air,\
    \ and humidity sensors in Type B. In type\nC, the pump can be operated remotely,\
    \ and in type D, a water\nflow or water meter-controlling system is provided.\n\
    They presented a cloud service-based architecture in [23]\nthat includes a variety\
    \ of services for farmers, including agri-\nfood-related services, financing,\
    \ fostering, warehouse manage-\nment, etc. They have suggested interactive video\
    \ conferencing,\nvoice-based services, text messaging, web portal services, and\n\
    more under the heading of cloud services.\nA key component of practicing smart\
    \ agriculture is precision\nagriculture. In this context, Patil et al. [24] suggested\
    \ a system\nthat measures soil moisture using sensors for temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and soil moisture. Additionally, they offered various\nmethods for highlighting\
    \ the issue of data loss.\nIn [25], Quasim et al. use blockchain techniques in\
    \ smart\nhealthcare systems to ensure the security of healthcare data.\nIt provides\
    \ the security, privacy, and efficiency of the data in\ntransmission between wearable\
    \ sensors and Internet of Things\n(IoT) devices.\nIn [26], Makhdoom et al. made\
    \ a blockchain-based frame-\nwork for privacy-preserving and secure data sharing\
    \ in smart\ncities. The system secures data sharing by segmenting the\nblockchain\
    \ network into different channels, where each channel\nconsists of a limited number\
    \ of authorized organizations and\nhandles a particular type of data, such as\
    \ financial information,\nhealth data, smart car data, or data related to smart\
    \ energy.\nAdditionally, smart contracts contain access control rules that\nregulate\
    \ who has access to the data of users within a channel.\nMany different types\
    \ of intelligent agricultural systems were\ndeveloped in the earlier work. Some\
    \ of these current systems\nare tabulated in Table I.\nIII.\nSYSTEM HARDWARE\n\

    \ and Rain Drop Sensor, only need\na 3.3V supply, the Capacitive Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensor and pH\nSensor need 5V. The GND pin serves as the common ground\nfor\
    \ every sensor. A solar panel system that is coupled to a\n9-volt battery backup\
    \ powers the system.\nB. Working Principle\nWe have divided our proposed framework\
    \ into different\nsubparts and each part’s working procedure is given below. The\n\
    overall working procedure is depicted in Fig. 12.\n1) Collecting Data From Sensor:\
    \ We used four different\ntypes of sensors, including capacitive soil moisture\
    \ sensors, pH\nsensors, MH-RD rain sensors, and LDR sensors, to execute\nsmart\
    \ IoT agriculture. We can estimate how much water is in\nthe soil with the aid\
    \ of a soil moisture sensor. A pH sensor,\nwhich ranges from 0 to 14, allows us\
    \ to determine the water’s\nacidity or alkalinity. Water turns acidic if the value\
    \ falls below\n7, else it is alkanoic. Consider levels 5.5 to 7 to be ideal for\n\
    growing crops. We can choose the best fertilizer for the soil\nwith the aid of\
    \ a pH sensor.\nBasically, a rain sensor is used to detect rain. A rain board\n\
    that can detect rain and a control module that can compare\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n\

    \ both included. The raindrop sensor\naids in our selection of how to operate\
    \ the motor. The LDR\nsensor, which is used to detect the presence of light, has\
    \ also\nbeen employed.\nNow, each of these sensors is linked to a node MCU board\n\
    in our project, and data from the sensors is uploaded to the node\nMCU board and\
    \ shown on the serial monitor of the Arduino\nUNO editor and\n2) Sending Data\
    \ to Cloud Server: The node MCU board\nreceives all sensor data, which we would\
    \ love to save in the\ncloud in order to control for remote distance. We have\
    \ utilized\nFirebase as a cloud server. We linked the Firebase authentication\n\
    and real-time database URL that we built for our project with\nthe Arduino UNO\
    \ script in order to integrate Firebase with\nNode MCU.\nAll data is sent as a\
    \ parent-child combination to Firebase.\nAll of the sensor data is sent from the\
    \ node MCU as a child\nof Smart Irrigation, which we have constructed as Parent.\
    \ The\nFirebase stores the child value as a key-value pair.\n3) Data Collection:\
    \ The Firebase’s database contains all of\nthe sensor data, which is compiled\
    \ as a CSV file. Four columns\nmake up our dataset: pH, LDR, Rain, and Moisture.\
    \ Nearly\n820 data are in our dataset. Only integer values are accepted in\nthe\
    \ Moisture column here, whereas string values are accepted\nin the Rain and LDR\
    \ columns.\n4) Data Pre-processing: Data can be often inconsistent.\nMissing values\
    \ or values out of range is typical. So, the dataset\nneeds some pre-processing\
    \ before it can be used to train any\nmodel [27]. For this reason, we have considered\
    \ three such\ncases.\n•\nMissing Value Handling: While exploring our dataset,\n\
    we observed humidity, raining status, daylight status,\nand pH level fields with\
    \ missing values. Therefore, we\nhave filled them with average values of the respective\n\
    field.\n•\nOne Hot Decoder: Label encoding is simply the\nprocess of converting\
    \ each value in a column to a\nnumber. By using label encoding, we have converted\n\
    the categorical text data into model-understandable\nnumerical data. We had to\
    \ use the label encoding to\nget our dataset ready for our model.\n•\nAbnormal\
    \ Data Handling: Some data contain abnor-\nmal values. For example, the range\
    \ of the temperature\nin our dataset falls between -20 to 30 degrees Celsius.\n\
    However, we have even found some data above and\nbelow this range. Data tuples\
    \ with these abnormalities\nhave been dropped from the dataset.\n•\nNormalization:\
    \ Normalization is used to increase the\naccuracy of models [28]. It is simply\
    \ the process of\nhaving all the data on the same scale. We have used\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n\
    991 | P a g e\n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and\
    \ Applications,\nVol. 14, No. 7, 2023\ntemperature, pressure, relative humidity,\
    \ and pressure\nas features to train our model. The features used\nto teach a\
    \ machine-learning algorithm have different\nranges of values. This can badly\
    \ affect the machine’s\nlearning ability. To solve this problem, we have\nstandardized\
    \ the feature values so that all the features\nstand equal in their representation.\
    \ By normalization,\nall the feature values are mapped in the range between\n\
    0 and 1.\n5) Machine Learning Model: The developed architecture is\na Neural Network\
    \ (NN) based because of its great accuracy. The\nfundamental advantage of NN over\
    \ classical machine learning\nmodels is that it recognizes significant traits\
    \ automatically\nand without human intervention. It’s a feed-forward NN with\n\
    parameters using the back-propagation algorithm and stochastic\ngradient descent.\
    \ Distinct processing layers serve different\npurposes. The output of the feature\
    \ map is produced by\nconventional layers, which conduct linear convolution between\n\
    a series of input tensors and filters. The nonlinear transformation\nis performed\
    \ using the ReLU, which is the most widely\nemployed activation function. The\
    \ activation function for the\nfully connected layer to the end must be careful\
    \ on the tasks.\nBatch normalization and an activation layer are performed after\n\
    each convolution.\nReLU = max(0, X)\n(1)\nd(x) = activation(wx + b)\n(2)\nDropout(x,\
    \ p) = (x : prob., p) (x : prob., 1 − p)\n(3)\nS(x) =\n1\n1 + e−x\n(4)\n6) Mobile\
    \ Application Development: A smart remote con-\ntrol application can ease our\
    \ maximum task [29]. We have used\nthe MIT app inventor to make the mobile application\
    \ that will\nbe connected to our system and by using this app we can do\nthe following\
    \ task\n•\nFertilizer Suggestion: By analyzing the pH value, the\napp may suggest\
    \ which fertilizer is best for a given\nsoil. The app will recommend some alkanoic\
    \ fertilizer\nif the pH value rises to help reduce the rising pH value\nand vice\
    \ versa. Algorithm 1 depicts how the fertilizer\nis suggested in our system.\n\
    •\nVisualization of Predicted Results: In order to predict\nwhether the motor\
    \ would turn off or not based on\nthe moisture, LDR, and raindrop sensor values,\
    \ we\nconstruct a neural network model and link it with\nour mobile app. Algorithm\
    \ 2 depicts how the remote\ncontrolling is done to control the motor in our system.\n\

    \ signal on to the\nnode MCU via the wifi module and sets the pin value\nto the\
    \ LOW, so turning off the motor.\nV.\nBLOCKCHAIN-BASED SMART-AGRI\nBlockchain\
    \ was described as a data structure using asym-\nmetric encryption algorithms\
    \ and hash functions to ensure\nthat data tampering and forgery are impossible\
    \ [30] [31] [32].\nEvery smart system needs to be taken under the shelter of a\n\
    security system to avoid getting an external attack. Our smart\nagricultural system\
    \ is public so any intruder can make attacks\nsuch as DoS attacks to crash the\
    \ system, and spoofing to alter\nthe control. In the IoT environment where high\
    \ computational\nencryption, decryption, and high-level security are not possible.\n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org\n992 | P a g e\n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications,\nVol. 14, No. 7, 2023\nTherefore, We are\
    \ implanting blockchain technologies into our\nsmart agricultural system through\
    \ which we are capable to\nmaintain high throughput, low latency, low communication\n\
    cost, and tamper-proof and traceability. Blockchain refers to a\ndistributed ledger\
    \ system where data or transactions are stored\nin blocks that are connected to\
    \ each other through making\nhash which can not only serve as unique IDs but also\
    \ prove\nthe integrity of the blocks. The hash of the previous block is\nused\
    \ to make a hash for the next block along with its data.\nIf any intruder wants\
    \ to tamper or alter the block data, all\nthe consecutive block hash will be changed.\
    \ Therefore, any\nintruder attempts to alter the data or spoof the blockchain\
    \ will\nnot be possible.\nIn this system, we consider nodeMCU, Firebase cloud,\
    \ and\nmobile app as nodes. In order to avoid altering data in the\nnetwork, we\
    \ are using blockchain technology. When any node\nwants to send data to other\
    \ nodes, it encapsulates the data\ninto a block along with its hash values (SHA256)\
    \ and nodeID\nthen adds it to the blockchain. All these nodes will contain the\n\
    blockchain locally. After adding the block, the node sends it\nto the cloud through\
    \ the network. We are not using any PoW,\nPoS, or accountant selection algorithms\
    \ which is not possible\nbecause of a very small amount of nodes and our nodeMCU\n\
    has very limited capabilities to run these algorithms (Algorithm\n3). When the\
    \ block is sent to the cloud, I validate the block by\nchecking all the hashes\
    \ of the previous block along with the\nnodeID. If it gets any error, the node\
    \ will consider the block\nas from an attacker and reject the block from adding\
    \ to the\nchain. Fig. 13 depicts the blockchain in our system.\nFig. 13. Blockchain\

    \ model that we built and implemented to forecast\nwhether the motor would be\
    \ on or off. We can operate our\nmotor using the two buttons in our app labeled\
    \ “ON\" and\n“OFF\". The motor status in the firebase changes to 1 when we\npress\
    \ the “ON\" button, and the firebase sends a signal to the\nnodeMCU board, which\
    \ then turns the motor on automatically.\nAnd that is how we can use our mobile\
    \ app to implement\nremote control.\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n993 | P a g e\n(IJACSA)\

    \ ANALYSIS\nA. System Evaluation\nIn Table II, we have shown the difference between\
    \ our\nsystem and the existing systems. The criterion based on which\nwe have\
    \ shown the differences are remote monitor control, data\nvisualization, customized\
    \ mobile application, machine learning\nintegrated framework, creating own database,\
    \ central cloud\ndatabase, pH-based fertilizer suggestions, Machine learning\n\
    model development, and full automation. The references from\n[11] to [24] there\
    \ is no such system that has implemented all the\ncriteria in their system. But\
    \ we have successfully implemented\nall the criteria in our systems.\nB. Machine\
    \ Learning Model Evaluation\nOur deep learning neural network is implemented with\n\
    the help of our own dataset. We split the dataset into 80-20\nratios for training\
    \ and validation purposes. The heat map of the\nfeatures columns is illustrated\
    \ in Fig. 16. We fit our gradient\ndescent neural network within the data set.\
    \ The input layer\nof the neural network receives 3 input lines from the features\n\
    column, namely, rain status, moisture level, and daylight status\nrespectively.\
    \ Then we add one dense layer with 16 neurons and\nthe activation function as\
    \ ReLu. The next layer is a dropout\nlayer with a 20% drop rate. Next, we add\
    \ another dense layer\nwith 8 neurons and apply the activation function as ReLu.\n\
    Then we add another dropout layer with a 20% drop rate.\nFinally, for the output\
    \ layer, we add another dense layer with\na single neuron with is satiable for\
    \ binary classification (i.e.\nmotor on-off decision) with activation function\
    \ as Sigmoid.\nThe experimental result of our model is represented in\nTable III\
    \ while showing the validation loss rate as binary cross\nentropy and validation\
    \ accuracy level in different epochs. Our\nmodel successfully outcomes a stable\
    \ level of accuracy for\nthe different epochs. We got almost 89.5% accuracy in\
    \ our\nexperimental set-up.\nVIII.\nFUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTION\nFor future smart\
    \ irrigation management, several issues must\nbe addressed as follows:\n•\nLow-latency\
    \ in Real-Time Application: The moni-\ntoring and controlling mobile application\
    \ must be able\nto transmit real-time data to the farmers or its entity\nwhile\
    \ ensuring a low latency network.\n•\nHigh Bandwidth: To facilitate a buffer-less\
    \ transmis-\nsion, we need to ensure maximum bandwidth level to\nthe transmission\
    \ process.\n•\nConnectivity: To meet the high communication de-\nmands of future\
    \ IoT-ML integrated irrigation systems,\nreliable synchronization between linked\
    \ autos would\nbe required.\n•\nDeployment of Network Elements: When a network\n\
    has a high enough number of nodes, its overall\nperformance increases. Because\
    \ network equipment\ndeployment is costly, it is vital to have the required\n\
    number of network components up and running as\nquickly as feasible.\n•\nAugmented\
    \ Reality: AR is a multimedia application\nthat mixes real-world scenes into virtual\
    \ scenes and\nsuperimposes virtual scenes over real-world scenes to\nsupplement\
    \ traditional real-image information. This\ntechnology has the potential to help\
    \ farmers become\nmore aware of the app’s functionality.\n•\nEdge Computing: This\
    \ networking approach is built\non a network control layer that is logically centralized.\n\

    IX.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have put forth an integrated solution that enables\nfarmers\
    \ to solve the challenges that limit their production\nand profitability by utilizing\
    \ cutting-edge technologies like\nmachine learning (ML), the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), and\nblockchain. Through user-friendly mobile applications and\na secure\
    \ cloud database, this model, implemented with a\ngenerated database, offers helpful\
    \ insights and recommendations\nto farmers, including pesticide usage and water\
    \ motor control.\nReal-time monitoring and data collecting is made possible\n\
    by the integration of IoT devices, enabling accurate decision-\nmaking and assuring\
    \ optimal resource allocation. Incorpo-\nrating blockchain technology also improves\
    \ data traceability,\ntransparency, and integrity, fostering trust and accountability\n\
    throughout the agricultural ecosystem. Farmers may gain from\nhigher productivity,\
    \ decreased expenses, and enhanced general\nagricultural management by implementing\
    \ our Smart-Agri\nframework. They can obtain up-to-date, accurate information,\n\
    make decisions that will increase productivity and reduce\nwaste, and improve\
    \ their agricultural techniques. We have\napplied the gradient descent neural\
    \ network model for water\ncontrol management and achieved up to 89.5% accuracy.\
    \ In\naddition, the suggested structure creates chances for cooperation,\ninformation\
    \ exchange, and market access, all of which help\nthe agricultural industry thrive\
    \ and flourish sustainably.\nIn the future, the framework’s scalability, and its\
    \ inter-\noperability can all be explored through more research and\ndevelopment\
    \ in this area, along with potential problems like\nconnectivity problems and\
    \ data privacy issues. We can build an\necosystem that really revolutionizes the\
    \ agriculture sector by\ncontinually improving and building upon these technological\n\
    achievements, making it more intelligent, efficient, and robust\nin the face of\
    \ changing global issues.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to acknowledge the support\

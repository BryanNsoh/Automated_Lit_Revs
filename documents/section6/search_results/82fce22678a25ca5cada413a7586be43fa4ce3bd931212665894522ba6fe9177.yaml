    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification

    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are
    half of the major and minor axis of the ellipse and is the height of the IRT sensor
    with respect to the soil. Download : Download high-res image (373KB) Download

    equation (10). (10) where is the IRT inclination, is FOV/2 and is the half of
    the ellipse-major axis from Fig. 3b. (11) (12) (13) (14) Using the ellipse equation

    (16) is obtained. (15) (16) where is the half of the minor axis of the ellipse.
    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    and GPS location on the center pivot. A Geo7X GPS (Trimble®, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
    allowed the definition of , (Span1 distance) and (Span2 distance) coordinates,
    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).
    (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number,
    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and
    discussion Fig. 5a shows the GPS node located at the center pivot final tower.

    cell panel connected to a voltage regulator from 12 V to 5 V. The Raspberry Pi3

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

    The increase in the world’s population in recent years and the forecast to reach
    9 billion by 2050 impact the need to increase food productivity [1] using the
    same agricultural areas, with reduced costs and less environmental impact. Factors
    such as extreme weather events, more demanding consumers, population concentrated
    in urban centers, and scarce natural resources are the major challenges to be
    faced [2]. In this context, some technologies of Industry 4.0 implemented in agriculture
    in recent years have generated impacts in several regions with climate change,
    scarcity of drinking water, and soil degradation, and in this context, some Industry
    4.0 technologies [3] can contribute to the management of inputs for planting and
    harvesting, the optimization of soil [4], water, and fertilizer use [5], an increase
    in productivity and food quality, and a decrease in environmental impacts [6]
    with the replacement of fossil energy sources by bio-renewable ones [7]. The digital
    revolution has had a great impact on development in several areas [8,9,10,11],
    and in agriculture [12], water use management projects [5] with controlled irrigation
    [6], use of soil parameter sensors [13] with nutrient application [14], and real-time
    monitoring [15] of increasingly unfavorable weather conditions in many regions
    [16] are options for smart agriculture [17]. The digitalization of agriculture
    [18] with the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies [19] has the potential to
    expand productivity, better control the product life cycle, aid cooperation in
    the production chain [20], reduce environmental impacts, improve food safety with
    reduced food waste [21], and increase the sustainable use of natural resources
    [22,23], and resilience to supply in times of scarcity [24]. The collection of
    large volumes of on-farm data [17,25], indicating weather and planting conditions
    [26], more detailed knowledge about planting and harvesting [27], and decreased
    waste [28], makes processes more controlled [17,25] and serves to support farmers
    in data-driven decision-making processes [21,29,30]. Integrating smallholder farmers
    into innovative trends [31] contributes to keeping young people in the countryside
    with rural tourism and social entrepreneurship activities, diversifying household
    income [32]. Additionally, various technological solutions are still restricted
    to large agricultural conglomerates and are more focused on profit than on food
    security and social context [33]. The Agriculture 4.0 revolution is an opportunity
    for farmers to meet the challenges in food production and enable the creation
    of added value by combining innovative technologies: precision agriculture, information
    and communication technology, robotics, and Big Data [34]. The increase in food
    production and, consequently, the consumption of natural resources, combined with
    other industrial activities, have increasingly affected environmental, social,
    and economic conditions [35]. Thus, the concept of the Circular Economy, with
    examples in China in the 1990s, in the use of natural resources [36], presents
    a change in the form of business and can contribute to the sustainable development
    of society [37]. The objectives of the Circular Economy are to reuse materials
    through recycling processes [38] and with the principles of conservation of natural
    resources, balancing consumption between renewable and non-renewable resources,
    with a longer lifetime of resource use and a reduction in the negative effects
    of productive systems [39]. These are important factors that can be applied with
    the new technologies of Industry 4.0 in precision agriculture to generate environmental,
    economic, and social balance. A few studies have explored various technologies
    in agriculture, but none have addressed an Integrated Service Architecture or
    its role in promoting the Circular Economy by illustrating how these technologies
    interact and collaborate. Moreover, the implementation of technologies was limited
    to an automation process such as irrigation control, fertilizer control, or even
    the storage of harvest variables and provision of some computerized support for
    farmers. Considering the great demand for food production, food safety, innovations,
    and new technologies to evaluate and minimize environmental and social impacts,
    no studies were found that can provide information to farmers about farm management,
    natural resource use needs, plantation and harvest data, and support for strategic
    or operational decision making. Based on the findings, this research aims to propose
    a Service Architecture that integrates Industry 4.0 technologies with the Circular
    Economy principles to promote sustainable development in agriculture. The paper
    provides a structured examination beginning with an introduction, followed by
    a detailed methodology in Section 2, an exploration of the Service Architecture
    for smart agriculture in Section 3, and ending with comprehensive conclusions
    in Section 4. 2. Methodology The study employed a systematic literature review
    to select and analyze scientific research on Industry 4.0 technologies applied
    in agriculture and their associated environmental, economic, and social gains.
    Bibliometrics enabled the identification of diverse publications, along with the
    use of quantitative and graphical data [40] and a systematic literature review
    to develop content analysis, coding, and categorization of data [41]. The systematic
    review applied in this research is characterized as a scientific, replicable,
    and transparent method [42]. Data verification was performed by two researchers
    to reduce researcher error and bias [43], by filtering the selected research [44]
    through systematic reviews and analyses with the adoption of inclusion and exclusion
    criteria [45]. The initial stage of planning the systematic literature review
    involved the definition of the research protocol, which included the search strategies,
    selection criteria, and analysis of the selected articles. For this study, the
    research objective was to propose a Service Architecture that enables the promotion
    of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The next step was the definition of
    the search terms and a consistent scientific procedure, including the definition
    of a set of keywords referring to Industry 4.0-enabling technologies. They were
    created as shown in Table A1, and with the use of logical operators OR and AND,
    the search strings were built in the Scopus digital library, as presented in Table
    A2. For the information collection step, the authors utilized the Scopus database
    chosen for its technical and scientific content, as well as content from areas
    related to the objectives of this article. A total of 1425 articles were identified,
    and these will be comprehensively detailed in the Bibliometrics section (Section
    3.1). In Table A3, the inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the systematic
    literature review are presented. A systematic literature review was undertaken,
    revealing a total of 755 articles. From this pool, 271 articles underwent thorough
    content analysis, leading to the identification of 114 articles specifically addressing
    the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture, as illustrated in
    Table 1. Table 1. Industry 4.0 technologies used in farms, production, and supply
    chain in the food agriculture sector. 1 = Farm; 2 = Factory; 3 = Supply Chain;
    4 = Big Data. 3. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture In this section, the
    bibliometric review and the proposed Service Architecture for smart agriculture
    will be presented. 3.1. Bibliometrics The initial search using the specified strings
    (refer to Table A1) resulted in a total of 1425 articles, categorized into various
    types, as outlined in Table A4. Figure 1 shows the number of studies classified
    by year. It is notable that there is a growing interest in the adoption of Industry
    4.0 technologies in agriculture. This interest is influenced by factors such as
    the increase in the world population and the necessity to produce higher-quality
    food, enhance productivity per hectare, and ensure sustainability throughout the
    agricultural chain. Figure 1. Distribution of selected articles published by year.
    The utilization of IoT on farms, as the most widely adopted technology, involves
    the incorporation of sensors and devices for measuring soil and environmental
    characteristics. Subsequently, the adoption of IoT technologies, the cloud, Big
    Data, and AI (artificial intelligence) [78] signifies that farms not only monitor
    soil and environmental data but also store them in cloud services. With the utilization
    of tools such as artificial intelligence within the Big Data ecosystem, they can
    already add value in business management and decision-making processes. Another
    crucial aspect is the integration of IoT and AI within a context where computing
    is transitioning to the edge, involving microcontrolled systems and artificial
    intelligence algorithms. This transition contributes to reducing latency in communication
    networks [86]. 3.2. Proposed Architecture Following the findings of the systematic
    literature review (Section 2), the articles were analyzed and evaluated based
    on their contribution to constructing a layered structure. This structure facilitates
    the organized placement and integration of technologies. Figure 2 illustrates
    the proposed architecture developed to promote a Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Figure 2. Proposed architecture. The architecture depicted in Figure 2 consists
    of sensors, connections between farm machinery, local and remote networks (via
    the Internet), cloud platforms, storage utilizing Big Data technologies, and computer
    systems operating both in the cloud and in computer centers. The information generated
    by expert systems, data analysis, and the utilization of artificial intelligence
    provides outputs in the form of dashboards, directs actions on connected equipment,
    and facilitates decision making, both at the strategic and operational levels.
    This architecture comprises three layers: the “Farm Scenery” data collection layer,
    the ”Cloud Storage” data collection layer, and the “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” central processing layer responsible for processing and outputting
    information for decision making: “Farm Scenery” layer: Precision agriculture is
    conducted here through the application of Industry 4.0 technologies. This involves
    sensors for the automated real-time collection of agricultural data, including
    water consumption, land use, and other input variables. The sensors and machines
    are interconnected through wireless networks in an IoT system. “Cloud Storage”
    layer: Data collected via wireless sensor networks, positioned at various points
    in the plantation, are transmitted to the cloud. This process is facilitated by
    a gateway, which serves to convert communication technologies from the sensor
    network into Internet access technologies. “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” layer: The received data undergo analysis using computational tools,
    and the resulting information is utilized for decision making, both at the control
    center level and within the farm itself. Information visualization is made accessible
    through graphic panels on local computers or mobile devices, printed reports,
    and commands for direct action on devices installed on the farm, thereby enabling
    some processes to be fully automated. The architecture will be elaborated by organizing
    the findings of the systematic literature review obtained from digital databases
    into the three layers of the proposed structure. 3.2.1. Farm Scenery Layer Data
    digitization in agriculture begins with identifying the variables to be controlled
    when planting on farms [84], such as temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients,
    as well as weather conditions such as humidity, air temperature, light, crop nutrients
    [76], and pest control [121]. IoT enables this through sensors installed at various
    points on the farm, exchanging information between electronic devices [113] and
    applied in agriculture to provide monitoring of weather, soil thermal conditions
    [81], and water [29,30], pest and disease detection [103], and product traceability
    [101]. Industry 4.0 technologies applied to agriculture enable real-time data
    collection, input management, soil control, disease prevention, increased production,
    optimizing resources, and generating income [114]. The use of drones with IoT
    sensors is already a possibility for data collection in scenarios where the installation
    of sensor networks is not possible [91]. Temperature affects crop growth and the
    breeding of bacteria, and through a system of collecting air and soil temperature
    and humidity, a mathematical model was developed that evaluates environmental
    conditions and compares them with established standards, generating alerts for
    decision making by farmers [126]. The need to reduce the use of natural resources
    such as water and fertilizers in agriculture, the treatment of waste generated
    in planting, harvesting, and food industry processing activities, and the increase
    in production [14] have been the driver for the deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in agriculture [117]. The analysis of climate conditions for agriculture is based
    on three factors: resource management, ecosystem conservation [114], and adequate
    services to farmers using information technology, thus generating profitability,
    product quality, and reducing the environmental footprint, with less use of pesticides
    [90]. Crop irrigation uses a source of water that is transported through pipelines
    and with on-and-off actuating devices and valves that then control the flow of
    water. The amount of water depends on each crop, and several forms of irrigation
    can be used, such as drip, sprinkler, furrow, and manual [127]. A simulation of
    irrigation control applied on farms in Brazil, with the use of IoT technologies,
    is a model considering the parameters of water requirements and irrigation time,
    which directly affect water use efficiency and evapotranspiration [30]. On the
    other hand, a low-cost system with environmental data acquisition can provide
    measurements of air temperature and velocity, soil temperature, pH, and dissolved
    oxygen, and thus control plant growth and environmental impacts [26]. A potato
    production system in Cyprus [114] was developed by using a sensor network to collect
    air and soil characteristics, and the data were sent to the cloud, where they
    were stored and analyzed, thus providing services to farmers for pest control
    and commands for automatic irrigation and fertilization [95]. Climate change has
    a strong impact on agriculture, and parameters such as water scarcity, soil degradation,
    increased energy needs, population growth, and increased demand for food impact
    the search for solutions [114]. For instance, the construction of smart greenhouses
    makes it possible to manage environmental variables [113] with control of humidity,
    air quantity, temperature, and favorable characteristics for plants [28,111] using
    models to manage heating, ventilation, CO2 control, and artificial lighting in
    an infrastructure that contributes to precision, sustainable, and manageable agriculture
    [113]. The data collected by the various sensors dispersed throughout the crops
    need to be sent for storage and analysis to extract information that can assist
    in decision making and return automated commands for control, since the Internet
    is not yet fully available in agricultural areas. It becomes necessary to use
    wireless network technologies in agriculture digitization projects, collecting
    data from distributed sensors in the field [4,84]. Applications with wireless
    sensor networks in smart agriculture include covering large areas with interconnecting
    sensors [6] and gathering large amounts of data. Activities in agriculture have
    integrated IoT technologies in robotic systems and been applied in planting, harvesting,
    and food production to enable cooperation between workers and smart systems and
    information sharing in the food production chain [107]. A proposed innovative
    smart IoT-based system based on microprocessors and a Single-Board Computer (BSC)
    for data logging using various sensors [50] can monitor soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature, and UV light, supporting precision irrigation of crops and enabling
    real-time exploitation of data for minimization of errors, as well as forecasting.
    In Colombia, on a coffee farm, wireless sensor networks are used to collect leaf
    condition data remotely through image analysis processing, detect diseases on
    the plantation [94], and generate information for pesticide application. This
    strategy decreases the risks of crop loss and improves the productive performance
    of the farm [112]. Automated fertigation [109] is applied in precision agriculture
    by collecting data on moisture and soil characteristics, and through an IoT system
    and sensor networks with ZigBee technology, the system was developed to control
    fertilizer use and reduce water consumption [14], thus providing reduced environmental
    impacts [95]. The growth of the number of sensors scattered in agriculture can
    generate a large amount of data, and latency problems may occur in sending data
    through technologies such as Bluetooth in relevant virtual network scenarios [75].
    Applications using machine learning [93] with a prototype for acquiring data from
    multiple sensors, machine learning algorithms, Geo statistics, and localization
    of IoT devices [115] are examples. The case study using computer vision [94] and
    machine learning [27] for inspecting coffee leaves on a farm in Colombia is an
    important practical example. The use of tractors in agriculture [3] plays an important
    role in farms and [98] modern combustion systems with electronic systems, including
    the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence [78], managing fuel injection,
    reducing pollutant emissions, lowering fuel costs [5], and improving environmental
    and economic gains. Tractors equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), through
    the CAN-BUS (Controller Area Network) protocol, transmit the data of tasks performed
    and, after analysis, evaluate the most appropriate use of the tractor, extending
    the useful life and reducing maintenance costs [87]. In research conducted in
    Brazil, agricultural machines equipped with automation technologies have proven
    very productive in sowing, spraying, fertilizing, and harvesting activities, doing
    so autonomously, with relevant economic gains and lower cost per hectare [3].
    An automatic irrigation control system using IoT, with data input from weather
    stations and soil moisture sensors interconnected by gateway LoRa (Long Range)
    networks and command messages sent by the MQTT protocol (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) [6], adapts the efficient use of water on a plantation, generating
    savings and better product quality [8]. It is important to note that using advanced
    technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation is a way to maximize crop
    yield while minimizing water consumption, in line with Agriculture 4.0 principles
    [51]. Nonetheless, intelligent sensing systems based on the edge-computing paradigm
    are essential for the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Agriculture
    4.0 applications, and the development of edge-computing wireless sensing systems
    is required to improve sensor accuracy in soil and data interpretation [47]. The
    Farm Scenery layer is presented in Figure 3, and the environmental variables to
    be collected are environmental humidity, temperature, luminosity, temperature,
    pH, water flow, and soil parameters, as shown in Table 2. Figure 3. Farm Scenery
    layer of Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. Table 2. Input variables used for soil monitoring
    and irrigation. 3.2.2. Cloud Storage Layer The data collected through wireless
    sensor networks, installed at various points of the plantation, are sent to the
    cloud with the use of a gateway, which is equipment that converts communication
    technologies of the sensor network to Internet access technologies, such as networks
    with LoRa technology [79]. Smart horticulture incorporates a variety of technologies,
    devices, protocols, and computational models to enhance farming processes. Blockchain,
    Big Data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge processing provide
    capabilities and solutions for storing, analyzing, and managing the vast data
    generated by components [74]. The data collected from sensors on the farm and
    sent for storage in a cloud environment (Figure 4) are transformed into information
    that will be used for decision making in agricultural management actions. Thus,
    autonomous systems of irrigation control and fertilizer application can be built,
    contributing to the economy of financial resources for the purchase of these inputs;
    environmental gains, with a reduction in the use of scarce resources in nature
    and in workers’ exposure to some of these products, are obtained, along with social
    gains, such as a reduction in diseases, accidents, and sick leave [102]. Figure

    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information Flow.
    With an architecture for monitoring variables of the air, soil, planting, and
    harvesting in a corn plantation and using sensors interconnected in wireless networks
    and communication gateways, the data are sent for cloud storage to allow its analysis
    [16]. 3.2.3. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output Layer After the stage
    of data analysis using computational tools and the extraction of information,
    the next stage is the output, with the visualization of information through graphical
    panels available on web pages or mobile devices such as smartphones, printed reports,
    and commands of action in devices installed on the farm, making some processes
    automated. The use of software for agricultural planning provides management of
    farms, the production chain, and the distribution of the food produced [121].
    The monitoring of environmental variables is context-sensitive and provides information
    to end-users such as farmers, agronomists, and traders for decision making and
    supporting agricultural production [16]. Machine learning plays an important role
    in data processing, collection, extraction, and mining activities using algorithms,
    neural networks, and artificial intelligence, which are applied in a variety of
    areas, such as energy, transportation, mining, shipping, healthcare, banking,
    security, and agriculture. Security requirements using machine learning in industrial
    systems [97], which analyze Blockchain-based strategies to preserve privacy in
    industrial systems with data security in sensors [19], can lead to product traceability
    and automated logistics management, saving time and financial resources [108]
    and decreasing food waste [88]. The application of machine learning and analysis
    techniques in agriculture and livestock provides productivity gains with the management
    of animal health and flock management, thereby improving land use, controlling
    animal nutrition, and reducing the environmental impacts generated [96]. The use
    of technologies in data processing in agriculture offers opportunities for the
    integration of diverse systems. A review of the technology standards used in cyber-physical
    systems (CPSs) [125] applied in advanced manufacturing builds the ontology of
    the 5C architecture layers (connection, conversion, computation, cognition, and
    configuration), thus enabling the integration of sensors, actuators, and protocols
    and their application in various areas. In agriculture, CPSs are used in planting
    and harvesting equipment, collecting information on soil conditions and water
    resources, and storage in cloud systems for further processing [107]. The use
    of IoT platforms with microservices involves independent processes acting on specific
    activities, such as, for example, data collection of soil, climate, and parameters
    of irrigated rice and cotton crops [110]. The platform involves hardware and software
    in the cloud, and focuses on irrigation management, presented scalability, flexibility,
    robustness, security, and performance, with possibilities of commercial applications
    in other agricultural crops. An infrastructure using low-cost IoT and free software
    code to monitor weather conditions in organic crops, in a greenhouse, automatically
    controls and generates information made available through graphs on web pages
    with HTML protocol (HyperText Markup Language) [28]. The organization of farms
    by management zones [109] reduces costs for fertilization, pesticides [82,83],
    and water, and with the agricultural records of each one, one can have a decision
    more suitable to the needs of the crop. This strategy applied in a vineyard in
    Spain allows the crops to be classified into three levels of interest: soil, plant,
    or product, thus creating a map with overlapping layers to determine wine quality
    [25]. Sugarcane is planted in several fields on a farm, and as the plantation
    matures, fields are selected for harvesting, which is called harvest windows.
    A model to guide planting and harvesting on farms in South Africa [122] caused
    increased productivity and optimization based on historical data collected when
    adjusted in real-time. A machine routing system is possible in sugar production
    using sensors and IoT techniques, replacing labor and providig more suitable routing,
    higher repeatability, decreased fuel consumption, and better process control,
    with economic and environmental gains [116]. The management of agricultural supply
    chain activities, with the adoption of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems
    and BI (Business Intelligence) techniques, enables communication between those
    involved in the agricultural chain [105], more adequate control, faster solutions
    [7,104] to respond to climate variations, pest control, crop harvesting and management,
    and market trends [118]. Ref. [121] presents studies among farmers in Maranhão,
    Piauí, Tocantins, and western Bahia, in soybean, corn, cotton, coffee, sugarcane,
    beans, and fruit crops where production and marketing integration, material flow
    automation, data management, and more accurate diagnostics to support strategic
    decisions have been adopted as tools of smart farm managers. The presentation
    of information in graphical dashboards becomes a decision support tool for farmers,
    with the use of Internet environments and mobile devices making access much easier
    and more intuitive [7,28]. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is shown in the Figure 5. Figure 5. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output
    layer of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information
    Flow. 3.2.4. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture The substantial volume
    of data generated through the utilization of IoT in agriculture is stored via
    networks and cloud computing. Leveraging Big Data and analytics strategies, it
    facilitates enhanced production by aiding decisions concerning planting, harvesting,
    and production, and automatically issuing commands for irrigation, thereby saving
    the scarce resource of water [5]. A system facilitating the collection of crop
    data, including air temperature, humidity, and soil temperature, stored as input
    variables in the cloud, has undergone analysis to derive actionable insights for
    controlling corn crop cultivation [16]. Utilizing a wireless network architecture
    to connect sensors and a LoRa communication gateway for data transmission to the
    cloud, the subsequent step involves data analysis and extraction of information
    for decision making. This process also includes sending commands to regulate irrigation
    valves, fertilizing devices, lighting control, and heating/cooling systems, embodying
    an autonomous application [16]. A prototype for autonomous irrigation, developed
    and deployed in a farmer cooperative in Spain, gathers data on air temperature,
    humidity, and soil characteristics. These data are transmitted via a LoRa network
    with a coverage range of 5 km to a cloud server. Subsequent analysis returns commands
    for irrigation control, while mobile applications provide information to farmers
    [100]. In Indonesia, image processing using machine learning algorithms was applied
    on a cocoa farm. Texture data of the beans, collected remotely and transmitted
    to the cloud, underwent classification using artificial intelligence techniques,
    demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional visualization methods
    [106]. The processing of vast sensor-generated data on farms is routed to the
    cloud [114,119]. Leveraging Big Data tools [85,117], these data are analyzed and
    converted into actionable information for managerial decision making and issuing
    automation commands for field equipment. A decision support system incorporating
    AI and a suite of machine learning algorithms aids in enhancing overall crop harvest
    quality and accuracy in precision agriculture [52]. This research utilized a dataset
    downloaded from Kaggle, containing eight features with seven independent variables,
    including N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Furthermore, optimization
    techniques were employed to further enhance performance in smart factories. Figure
    6 illustrates the complete design of the Integrated Service Architecture derived
    from the results of the systematic literature review of selected articles, aimed
    at promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Figure 6. Operational vision
    of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. In the layer designated as “Information Processing,
    Analysis, and Output” within the Integrated Service Architecture aimed at advancing
    the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0, the references are categorized according
    to their respective applications, including irrigation control systems, fertilizer
    and pesticide application, crop management, greenhouses, and organization and
    management. These classifications are presented in Table 3 for clarity and ease
    of reference. Table 3. Management systems and outputs used in Intelligent Agriculture.
    3.2.5. Economic, Environmental, and Social Gains The integration of Industry 4.0
    technologies in agriculture empowers farmers with control over crucial resources
    such as water, nutrients [109], pesticides, energy, machinery, robotic devices
    [77], and human resources [32]. Data-driven decision making and innovative business
    models [119] are instrumental in enhancing production strategies [13], reutilizing
    process waste [114], and minimizing losses across the agribusiness chain. Consequently,
    economic benefits can be assessed by analyzing the efficient management of input
    resources utilized in production, alongside the increased availability of high-quality
    products offering added value to consumers. This added value encompasses aspects
    such as product differentiation, enriched nutritional content, and innovative
    packaging strategies, contributing to market competitiveness and profitability
    in agriculture. Environmental benefits are quantifiable through monitoring resource
    consumption indicators such as water usage, nutrient management, and greenhouse
    gas emissions. Furthermore, sustainable agricultural practices may lead to ecosystem
    restoration, biodiversity conservation, and soil health improvement, thereby enhancing
    environmental value and resilience. Social benefits encompass improvements in
    food security [1], reduced dependency on hazardous inputs, and the creation of
    employment opportunities in rural areas [32]. Initiatives fostering inclusivity
    and community engagement contribute to the formation of social capital and overall
    societal well-being. 3.2.6. Circular Economy Important resources for food production
    are wasted, with only 40% of irrigation water reaching the plants, and merely
    5% of the applied fertilizer being transformed into nutrients absorbed by humans.
    Soil degradation affects between 30 and 85% of agricultural land, exacerbating
    food insecurity issues [39]. Following the linear production model for food production
    is no longer sustainable, especially in a scenario where necessary resources are
    increasingly scarce [128]. Therefore, to minimize the utilization of finite natural
    resources, it is imperative to adopt the principles of Circular Economy, which
    include preserving and enhancing natural capital by managing finite stocks and
    balancing renewable resource flows, optimizing resource yields through the circulation
    of products, components, and materials in technical and biological cycles, and
    fostering system effectiveness by addressing and mitigating negative externalities
    [39]. Figure 7 illustrates systems of the Circular Economy in a diagram, showcasing
    the management flow of renewable energy and finite materials, while highlighting
    the fundamental principles of circularity. Figure 7. Diagram of Circular Economy
    systems [129]. In the systematic literature review on Agriculture 4.0 and the
    associated technologies, only two articles were identified that mentioned the
    Circular Economy, along with a study outlining the barriers to its adoption [84],
    highlighting the lack of incentive and governmental support. Main challenges identified
    include pesticide usage and unproductive laborers [83]. Although the Circular
    Economy was not explicitly referenced, several articles demonstrated evidence
    of its application. Therefore, based on the ReSOLVE framework, evidence of Circular
    Economy implementation in Agriculture 4.0 was identified. This includes models
    for Regenerate (soil regeneration, nutrient recovery, utilization of renewable
    energy, and finite resource reuse), Share (equipment and technology sharing, as
    well as waste sharing), Optimize (automation, pesticide and water usage optimization,
    and energy consumption optimization), Loop (remanufacturing, reverse logistics,
    and recycling), Virtualize (information virtualization and remote service utilization),
    and Exchange (integration of new technologies such as IoT, cloud, Big Data, and
    robotics). The ReSOLVE framework operationalizes these principles through six
    key actions: Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange, as shown
    in Figure 8. Figure 8. Framework ReSOLVE—adapted from [130]. These actions involved
    analyzing the articles to ascertain the evidence of Circular Economy usage, which
    was then compiled and is presented in Table 4. Table 4. Variables to evaluate
    evidence of practices of use of Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. 4. Conclusions
    This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies
    applied in agriculture, analyzing 114 selected articles to fulfill the research
    objective of proposing an integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. A systematic literature review is chosen over traditional
    analysis due to its comprehensive and rigorous synthesis of existing research,
    which provides a nuanced understanding of the topic and helps identify gaps in
    the literature. This approach ensures that the work is grounded in thorough knowledge
    of existing research, enhancing the credibility and validity of the findings and
    advancing knowledge in the field. Research indicates that farms are increasingly
    leveraging IoT for sensor connectivity as a foundational step towards embracing
    a data-centric approach. This transition is underscored by a shift towards a culture
    of data-driven decision making, facilitated by the integration of advanced analytics
    and AI within cloud-based Big Data ecosystems. This research adds to our understanding
    of how Industry 4.0 technologies are currently applied in agriculture, identifying
    both the technologies used and their application areas. Studies have shown that
    farms are utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies for irrigation control [6,30,109,110,114,120];
    fertilizer and inputs [95,110,114]; planting and harvest management [26,28,111,116];
    agricultural greenhouse systems [113]; and area-based planting organization [7,25,109,121,122].
    A few studies were found on evaluating economic, environmental, and social gains
    generated by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies on farms and the connection between
    Industry 4.0 technologies adopted on farms and the Circular Economy. Therefore,
    the authors proposed an Integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0, composed of three layers: Farm Scenery, Cloud Storage,
    and the Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer. The Farm Scenery layer
    is responsible for executing precision agriculture, utilizing sensors to automatically
    collect data and interconnecting them through wireless networks in a system known
    as the Internet of Things. The Cloud Storage layer is responsible for gathering
    data from various points on the plantation and transmitting them to cloud servers,
    facilitated by gateways. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is tasked with analyzing the received data. It utilizes tools from the Big Data
    ecosystem to generate information, aiding in decision making, issuing automatic
    commands to activate irrigation control equipment and inputs, and presenting management
    reports on graphical screens accessible via computers or mobile devices. These
    reports encompass economic, environmental, and social gains. This paper enriches
    existing theory by introducing a novel Service Architecture designed to advance
    Circular Economy principles within Agriculture 4.0. The proposed framework aims
    to foster economic, environmental, and social benefits, thereby enhancing sustainability
    in agricultural practices. The practical contribution centers on developers’ ability
    to utilize the proposed architecture to construct monitoring systems with IoT,
    applications for decision-making analysis, and management tools, fostering a data-driven
    decision culture on farms. The societal contribution lies in the potential to
    alleviate food insecurity and reduce waste. As a limitation of this research,
    its initial application is solely on farms. However, there is potential for expansion
    into the broader agribusiness supply chain as future prospects emerge. Future
    research includes adapting this Integrated Service Architecture for use in other
    activities within the agricultural chain, incorporating specific input variables
    and output indicators on screens and autonomous systems as needed. Another possibility
    is integrating other actors in the agribusiness chain into the Integrated Service
    Architecture, thereby enhancing the management of the agricultural ecosystem.
    Additionally, it can broaden the practical applications or policies that stem
    from this study. Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.A.V., G.C.d.O.N. and

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download

    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res

    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art

    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.

    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating

    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: An optimized irrigation system maximizes agricultural productivity,
    ensures efficient water use, and reduces off-site effects caused by excess percolation
    of water. To address the problems associated with conventional irrigation systems,
    a drip irrigation system that is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    for automation of irrigation scheduling was developed and tested for Egg Plant
    (Brinjal) crop in vertisols. The study compared crop performance under two different
    drip irrigation systems - one based on IoT and the other based on crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc). An intelligent data collection system, including sensors and a microcontroller
    was used in the experiment to monitor relative humidity, soil temperature, air
    temperature, and soil moisture content. The sensors collect data wirelessly transmitted
    to a cloud server via the IoT, allowing worldwide access from anywhere. The performance
    of the egg plant crop revealed significantly higher plant height and crop yield
    (12.05%) under a drip irrigation system utilizing IoT technology, which could
    be due to the optimum and timely application of water over ETc-based drip irrigation.
    Along with improved crop performance, water savings of 35.2% were observed as
    compared to ETc-based drip irrigation. The developed system can be evaluated in
    a large field with several sensors together along with a mobile app for a user-friendly
    system.

    Abstract An optimized irrigation system maximizes agricultural productivity, ensures
    efficient water use, and reduces off-site effects caused by excess percolation
    of water. To address the problems associated with conventional irrigation systems,
    a drip irrigation system that is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    for automation of irrigation scheduling was developed and tested for Egg Plant
    (Brinjal) crop in vertisols. The study compared crop performance under two different
    drip irrigation systems — one based on IoT and the other based on crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc). An intelligent data collection system, including sensors and a microcontroller
    was used in the experiment to monitor relative humidity, soil temperature, air
    temperature, and soil moisture content. The sensors collect data wirelessly transmitted
    to a cloud server via the IoT, allowing worldwide access from anywhere. The performance
    of the egg plant crop revealed significantly higher plant height and crop yield
    (12.05%) under a drip irrigation system utilizing IoT technology, which could
    be due to the optimum and timely application of water over ETc-based drip irrigation.
    Along with improved crop performance, water savings of 35.2% were observed as
    compared to ETc-based drip irrigation. The developed system can be evaluated in
    a large field with several sensors together along with a mobile app for a user-friendly
    system. PDF Published 2024-03-07 Issue Vol. 83 No. 3 (2024): Journal of Scientific

    ledger technologies (DLT); IOTA tangle; rice cultivation; sustainability; real-time
    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    environmental conditions. Sprinkler irrigation [76] Utilized AI to estimate drip

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.

    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].
    In order to promote sustainable agriculture, this survey article focuses on cutting-edge
    IoT and sensor applications in smart agriculture. The study also focuses on the
    IoT architecture for smart agriculture as well as the size of the worldwide market
    for smart agriculture in the next years. 1.4. Preceding affined review papers

    monitoring (yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing monitoring), forecasting,
    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may
    save time and money. They are the best option for anybody looking to install a
    more ecologically friendly and economical irrigation system since they allow users
    to preserve water resources while enhancing plant health and production [57],
    [58], [59], [60]. 3.2. Fertilizer administration Administration of fertilizers
    based in the realm of smart agriculture, IoT is a crucial application that makes
    use of IoT technology to maximize the usage of fertilizers. With the help of this
    application, farmers will be able to get up-to-the-minute information on the state
    of their soil and its nutrient content, which they can use to modify how much
    and what kind of fertilizer they apply to their crops [61], [63], [65], [67].
    Employing a variety of sensors, like the NPK sensors, temperature sensors, soil
    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling
    crop diseases is an essential part of contemporary agriculture. Illnesses may
    drastically lower agricultural production, costing farmers money and jeopardizing
    the world''s food supply [71]. The overuse of pesticides and other chemicals can
    also have negative environmental impacts, such as polluting water supplies and
    upsetting natural ecosystems [72]. Fortunately, improvements in IoT technology
    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.
    Monitoring, forecasting and harvesting Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely
    used in smart agriculture are shown in Table. 2 name of sensors in column 1, sensor

    it is present. The sensor alerts the smart agricultural system when a flame is
    found so that it may take the necessary steps to stop the fire from spreading
    [99], [100]. Flexible sensor Yield Monitoring. An advanced, flexible, wearable
    sensor called the plant and food quality monitor was created specifically to track
    the quality of plants, fruits, and food. Real-time data collection is made possible
    by its soft and versatile shape, which makes it easy to install easily on the
    surface of various food items and plants without causing any damage [108]. In
    addition, as the world''s population continues to expand, IoT and smart agricultural
    sensors can assist farmers in meeting the rising food demand. Farmers may boost
    productivity while decreasing expenses and environmental effects by implementing
    these technologies. On the other hand, wave-based technologies are rapidly being
    used in industrial applications and smart sensors, due to their efficiency in
    analyzing and processing complex signals [109], [110], [111]. Together, these
    studies highlight the variety of applications for wavelet-based signal processing,
    from denoising and analysis in industrial environments to applications for smart
    sensors and machine learning. Given their versatility and efficiency in processing
    complex signals, wavelet methods are increasingly used in a variety of fields
    as useful tools for industrial processes and current sensor technology. Overall,
    the application of IoT and smart agriculture sensors in the agricultural business
    has the potential to alter the way we grow our food. These technologies can boost
    production and efficiency, and support sustainable farming methods by letting
    farmers gather and evaluate real-time data on numerous environmental conditions.
    This will be essential for supplying the world''s growing population with food
    in the future. 5. The benefits and challenge of IoT in agricultural 5.1. Benefits
    IoT application in agriculture, as in other sectors, provides previously unavailable
    efficiency, resource savings, cost, automation, and data-driven operations. IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture offers a number of noteworthy benefits, including superior efficiency,
    expansion, reduced resources, cleaner method, agility, and also product quality
    improvement. Numerous research papers have looked into the advantages of implementing
    the IoT in intelligent agriculture [30], [60], [112], [113]. As shown in Fig.
    6, the six benefits of the IoT in agriculture, we will discuss each benefit separately
    following: 1) Superior efficiency: Today''s agriculture is competitive. Farmers
    must produce more despite unfavorable soil conditions, diminishing land availability,
    and rising weather whims. Farmers can track their fields and environmental conditions
    in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can generate ideas rapidly,
    foresee issues before they happen, and determine how to avoid them by employing
    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

    apps efficiencyActuators 1. Introduction One of the major challenges is to eliminate
    hunger and poverty while also ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and food
    systems. This can be accomplished by establishing integrated systems capable of
    achieving food security and sustainable development. Hydroponic and aeroponic
    systems are alternatives to traditiona1 agriculture that could be used effectively
    in Egypt to meet the country''s rapidly growing population. In comparison to conventional
    agriculture and other soilless methods, automation of hydroponic and aeroponic
    systems in smart greenhouses has demonstrated promising results in several countries
    and is advised as the most effective, economical, and suitable plant cultivation
    system. One of the most significant challenges facing protected agriculture is
    controlling the environment inside greenhouses. The traditional hydroponic and
    aeroponic agriculture systems are still waiting significant advancements in networking
    technology, especially in controlling the influencing factors inside the greenhouse.
    These challenges can be solved through continuous monitoring of the vital growth
    parameters, with a momentary measurement of all of these parameters. Intensive
    and extensive researches have been carried out to explore the development of smart
    technologies in agriculture field. Much effort has been expended to improve greenhouse
    systems: Sambo et al. [1] present a review of the literature on hydroponic greenhouse
    systems and smart technologies that can help them perform better. Fernandes et
    al. [2] developed a system to regulate the humidity and temperature of a greenhouse-based
    hydroponic system. However, the numerous plug-ins and software needed made system
    configuration challenging. Unfortunately, because it only offers cooling systems
    to control high temperatures, only summer crop production was intended to benefit
    from the system. Besides, the pH and nutrient solution concentration (EC) were
    not determined. As a result, the system will provide inaccurate information about
    pH and nutrient combination. Yamaguchi et al. [3] developed a closed, integrated
    hydroponic system that can support the growth of 10 heads of lettuce. They designed
    the system with adjustable lighting for use indoors or in a glasshouse. After
    28 days, the authors were ab1e to harvest the lettuce using the proposed system,
    but this system required manual intervention to work properly. A hydroponic greenhouse
    system was recently successfully constructed by Sihombing et al. [4], but this
    system has a disadvantage of measuring only the water level and the temperature
    of the nutrient solution. The authors of [5], [6] built a system that measures
    water leve1, pH, electrica1 conductivity, water temperature, and relative humidity.
    After the data was sent to a database, farmers were alerted to things like the
    imbalance of nutrients in the system. The sole purpose of the system is to observe
    the hydroponic setting. As a result, because the system lacks actuators, the farmer
    must control events. The prediction models type for lettuce quality from IoT-based
    hydroponic farms were created by Gartphol et al [7]. The authors built a smart
    hydroponic lettuce farm with real-time management of operations and environmental
    data collection. A large set of data was collected and regression models were
    created using machine learning algorithms. Due to errors like those found when
    measuring lettuce''s height due to variations brought on by blowing wind, the
    model was unable to produce a successful learning outcome. Also, an automated
    hydroponic system was created by Nalwade and Mote [8], that ensures the potential
    of hydrogen pH and EC of nutrients are measured automatically and maintained by
    the system before being transmitted to farmer via GSM. As there is no oversight
    of the nutrient level. This might result in the plant receiving a lot of nutrients.
    A Rasberry Pi3 and a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA were used by the authors
    in [9], [10] to control and monitored water level, humidity, and temperature using
    a sizable model of IoT-based systems. The modularity of the system allows for
    simple maintenance. But the system relies on a server that might not always be
    reachable for communication. Furthermore, because growing plants have different
    requirements and consumption rates, a fixed might not be the best choice. Siregar
    et al. [11] suggested a closed greenhouse monitoring system with open garden shield
    and hydroponic system, Arduino Uno microcontroller, and different sensors as PH
    sensor, EC sensor, water and air temperature sensor, light sensor, and GSM/GPRS.
    The Arduino Uno receives the data from the sensors that the shie1d has collected
    and has sent it via I2C communication. Because the proposed system lacks actuators,
    it is reliant on the farmer to regulate the environment. According to Lakhiar
    et al. [12], the application of sophisticated monitoring technology tools in aeroponics
    may allow for remote monitoring and management of all system parameters. As a
    result, it may reduce system casualties caused by the time-consuming manual monitoring
    and regulating process. To better understand how various environmental and nutrient
    characteristics connect to plant growth, plant scientists may need a range of
    data that the approach provides. In contrast to conventional agriculture, aeroponics,
    hydroponics, and aquaponics systems reduce water loss and increase water usage
    efficiency, according to Ali Al Shrouf [13], who examined the key differences
    between three new agricultural systems and conventional farming methods. S.Ramakrishnam
    Raju et al. [14], implemented a smart hydroponics expert system that is based
    on artificial intelligence and operates in IoT environment to monitor and control
    various parameters. The results show that the proposed system performs better
    than expected in terms of accuracy. Doaa K. Hassan et al. [15], investigated the
    state of productive urban landscape practices used in gated communities. The hydroponic
    systems are as one of the main focus. Practitioners showed that Soilless/hydroponic
    culture could be a great value in such practices. Tarek Selim, Mohamed Galal Eltarabily
    [16], presented a study for decision-makers and small-scale farmers in Egypt.
    They discussed the sector of agriculture systems and the switch to smart irrigation
    systems in small farms. Charisma Aulia Jamhari, et al. [17], They created a hydroponic
    monitoring and automation system that can be observed using sensors linked to
    an Arduino microcontroller, a Wi-Fi module, and Mode1 B microcomputers operating
    as webservers. The results show that this method helps farmers increase the effectiveness
    and efficiency of monitoring and running hydroponic farms. Aeroponics did not
    use water as a growing medium, in contrast to hydroponics. The roots of the plant
    are submerged in water in a hydroponic system in order to collect nutrients and
    water for survival. When employing sprinklers or nozzles, aeroponics, on the other
    hand, delivers the nutrients to the plant''s roots in a mist spray [18]. A system
    for monitoring plant growth automatically has been installed. Rea1-time measured
    data are analysed and reviewed to maximise the benefits to water and land units.
    In this study, data from remote locations were monitored, gathered, and analysed
    using IoT technique. All facets of human life are significantly impacted by the
    Internet of Things. One option for effectively automating monitoring is to use
    Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors [19]. It can be applied cooperatively to
    complete challenging tasks that call for high intelligence. IoT devices have integrated
    sensors, actuators, processors, transmitters, and receivers to support this intelligence
    and connectivity [20], [21]. The first layer in this study''s IoT architecture
    is the perception layer, which includes many sensors like those for temperature,
    humidity, illumination intensity, and TDS. The second layer is the transport layer,
    which uses wireless communication networks Wi-Fi was chosen for this study to
    transmit data from the perception layer to the processing layer and vice versa.
    While the processing layer is in charge of managing, storing, and processing vast
    amounts of data that are received from the transport layer. It''s important to
    note that the system was developed using cloud computing technology, which allows
    the system to monitor data on the internet and create a user-friendly web browser
    application. This could make the system quicker, more effective, real-time, affordable,
    and user-friendly. Thus, the developed system''s goal can be accomplished. The
    application layer, which sits at the bottom of the stack, houses an alert system
    and can inform the decision-maker of any systemic issues via alert messages. Delivering
    application-specific services is primarily the responsibility of the administrators
    who are allowed access to the developed website and mobile application. Hydroponic
    and aeroponics systems with smart IoT automated greenhouses were constructed in
    this study to support sustainable crop production development. The developed system''s
    ability to maximize the use of each unit of water, energy, and agricultural fertilizers
    to achieve the highest possible productivity from pesticide-free plants is what
    distinguishes it from competing systems. 2. Material and method 2.1. Deployment
    of smart greenhouse The system design and construction will be introduced in this
    section as shown in Fig. 1. The greenhouse was installed at 25 m2 greenhouse in
    Delta region, Egypt. It was constructed according to the system of interlocking
    arches. The metal skeleton is made of galvanized pipes. Arches and posts are 2
    in. in diameter and 1.8 mm in thickness. Arches and posts supporters are 1-inch
    diameter and 1.8 mm thickness. The Supporters carry 2D camera to be moved freely
    in both directions X and Y. The entire greenhouse was covered completely with
    plastic panels of 200 µm thickness which transmit the light highly. A fixed shading
    net has been installed on all lateral sides of the constructed greenhouse as shown
    in Fig. 1 (a). The smart greenhouse design (with hydroponic and aeroponic systems)
    is depicted in Fig. 1 (b). Furthermore, the aeroponic system tanks (1 and 2) and
    Pesticide and nutrient tanks shown in Fig. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. Download

    Design and construction of smart greenhouse. 2.2. Deployment of hydroponic system
    greenhouse The constructed hydroponic system shown in Fig. 2 uses water nutrient-rich
    solution as a growing medium and offers vital nutrients for sustaining p1ant growth.
    It is carried out in the absence of any growing media. Two horizontally shaped
    hydroponic cultivation systems were built inside the greenhouse and installed
    on both sides of the greenhouse. PVC pipes with a diameter of 4 in. and a thickness
    of 4 mm were used in both systems. Each system is a network consisting of pipelines,
    timer, and nutrient solution and ends with a tank of 100 L capacity. Each tank
    is connected to a pump to transfer the nutrient solution to the pipelines to feed
    the plants. Then, the nutrient solution returns back to the tank to get benefit
    from it again. Details of each system are shown in Table 1. Download : Download

    control system IoT based smart greenhouse The goal of greenhouse automation, intelligence,
    and reliable data transmission can be accomplished by a smart control system for
    greenhouses based on IoT. This system can realize comprehensive perception, reliable
    transmission, and intelligent processing of greenhouse environmental parameters.
    The system''s primary components include sensors, microcontrollers, centralized
    computers, and actuators, as was already mentioned. The system parameters were
    intelligently automated, stored, and displayed via an IoT platform. A field control
    system is created by connecting sensors and actuators to a microcontroller. With
    only a small amount of user input, the built-in system can keep the plants'' growing
    conditions healthy. The greenhouse environment is controlled by a set of sensors
    and actuators that connected to real time measurement and alarm system. Temperature,
    humidity, lightening intensity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are measured through
    monitoring sensors. Fig. 4 shows the developed IoT based Smart Greenhouse, in
    which the perception layer is the core and fundamental element of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture and irrigation. It perceives the microclimate environment
    information of the greenhouse comprehensively, provides an accurate, scientific,
    and thorough basis for automatic control and intelligent decision-making. Fig.

    developed system. When the sensors provide context information, it is transferred
    to the microcontroller, which is utilized to integrate all of the deployed devices''
    data on a single platform. The structural design is based on three major components
    that are needed to carry out various tasks. The first component, known as the
    physica1 layer, is divided into three sub-components: Sensors, actuators, and
    microcontrollers. Sensors, such as light and TDS sensors are in greenhouse, humidity/temperature
    sensors are in and out greenhouse. All sensors p1ay an important role in gathering
    information about the optimum values for plant growth. These sensory devices send
    the collected data to a microcontroller, which then makes a decision by interacting
    with the user remote1y via the internet. Actuators for greenhouse as a nutrient
    tank, a water pump, lights, fan, cool panel and windows. They are used to carry
    out the user''s command. Monitoring, which includes plant and climate monitoring,
    is the second major component of smart greenhouse. The appropriate observation
    is made by the devices in climate monitoring to balance the environment that is
    required for the crop that is cultivated within. IoT data acquisition is divided
    into two parts: standard data acquisition and IoT-based data acquisition. Wi-Fi
    communication protocol is a standard type. HTTP protocol is used for IoT data
    acquisition. This protocol is used to communicate over long distances. Furthermore,
    IoT-based data acquisition is used to maintain greenhouse conditions in order
    to increase the production rate of quality crops efficiently. Wi-Fi connectivity
    within the cloud enables data transmission to the cloud via a microcontroller
    and storage in a cloud-based database. The data saved in the cloud is repeatedly
    transmitted to the user''s mobile device via the internet to initiate a remote
    check using developed application by authors as shown in Fig. 6, allowing the
    user to change the threshold for the greenhouse climate. Download : Download high-res

    by authors to initiate a remote check (for alarm and control system). Depending
    on the threshold value for the temperature, the micro-controller activates the
    driver circuit of actuators for regulating the airflow and stabling the temperature.
    The temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment (out of the greenhouse)
    are measured to be periodically compared with the interior temperature and humidity
    of the greenhouse. Pesticides are sprayed inside the greenhouse using the pesticide
    spraying tank that connected to the fogging network. Furthermore, with the help
    of IoT environment and cloud computing, another facility to access data remotely
    from all over the world is provided. 3.1. Temperature The primary environmental
    factor that impacts how frequently plants grow and develop is temperature. The
    higher temperatures, the faster chemica1 processes proceed which deteriorate the
    enzyme activities. The cooling system inside the greenhouse operates using a cooling
    panel attached to a 0.5 HP pump. It pumps water from the cooling tank to the cooling
    panels to provide the required temperature inside the greenhouse. A heating system
    was set up in the greenhouse using oil heaters with a tota1 capacity of 3000 kW.
    The heating system keeps the greenhouse''s internal temperature suitable for cultivation
    during the winter or whenever the temperature decreases. A single fan has been
    installed to ensure uniform temperature distribution and air circulation within
    the greenhouse. The temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 and DHT22 in and out
    the greenhouse is a basic as shown in Fig. 7, low-cost, multipurpose digital sensor
    that monitors the temperature and relative humidity of the air around it using
    a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor and a capacitive sensor module.
    The sensor generates a digital signa1 at the output pin. It is suitab1e for readings
    with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and a sampling rate of no more than 0.5 Hz for temperatures
    between −40 and 125 °C (once every 2 s). Download : Download high-res image (163KB)

    and measures the temperature on a regular basis. It is linked to the cooling pump,
    which sends signals to the cooling panel in Fig. 8 (a) to pump water, and the
    suction fan operates in parallel, as shown in Fig. 8(b). When the temperature
    falls, the sensor sends a signal to the heaters in Fig. 8(c) to raise the temperature
    to the desired level. Generally speaking, the growth environment''s temperature
    should range from 30 °C to 4 °C. However, the temperature in the greenhouse was
    adjusted between 20 and 35 °C. Download : Download high-res image (769KB) Download

    Humidity A sensor was installed to regularly maintain and contro1 the required
    humidity concentration inside the greenhouse based on plant needs. The high level
    of humidity is controlled by drying it using heaters and also, operating the suction
    fan to withdraw the air saturated with moisture particles. On the other hand,
    the decrement of the humidity levels is controlled by a fogging network. The fogging
    network consists of a tank as shown in Fig. 9 and a submersible pump with a power
    of 0.5 Hp to pump water to the network. The network also includes nine quadrilateral
    water sprinklers. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download : Download

    The illumination intensity 1000 LUX light-emitting diode LED headlamps are used
    to control the illumination intensity. Given that it promotes rapid photosynthesis
    and plant growth. In an aeroponics system, the LED is thought to be the best light
    source for plant growth. The NORP12 sensor is a photoconductive cell covered in
    a moisture-resistant coating and housed in a plastic casing. Its spectra1 response
    is similar to that of the human eye. Light sensor’s output vo1tage modification
    depends upon the intensity of light. It is worth mentioning that, the illumination
    intensity operate automatically as the plant needs the light absence at night.
    However, this was utilized in research to examine the dampening effect of illumination
    intensity on plant growth. 3.4. The Total dissolved solids (TDS) To ensure successful
    plant growth, the TDS value of the nutrient solution, where water and nutrient
    solution are repeatedly recycled, must be measured on a regular basis. A sensor
    placed in the nutrient tanks is used to regulate the TDS. TDS value is measured
    using TD1000-T sensor. It needs to be adjusted if the TDS are not at the right
    level. To increase the TDS in the Nutrient tank, the sensor sends a signal to
    a solenoid valve. The optimum pH of nutrients is 5.5–––6.5, which can be adjusted
    using pH up and pH down solutions, which are non-concentrated acids and bases.
    Total dissolved solids (TDS) recommendations range from 300 to 400 mg/l for seedlings
    and seeds, 500 to 600 mg/l for vegetative growth, and 700 to 900 mg/l for advanced
    vegetative growth [22], [23]. 4. Development of a dynamic website and mobile application
    The website that was created is dynamic as shown in Fig. 10. Web pages on dynamic
    websites are typically generated in rea1 time. When a user accesses a dynamic
    page, the data stored in the cloud is repeatedly transmitted to the developed
    PHP website and user''s mobile device through developed mobile application by
    authors via the internet to initiate a remote check as shown before in Fig. 6.
    Fig. 11 depicts the developed dynamic PHP website by authors. Fig. 12 shows the

    5.1. TDS comparative results Leafy Plants such as lettuce, Spanish, cabbage, and
    others were grown in the greenhouse''s developed hydroponic and aeroponic systems.
    The most significant influencing factor on the plantation is TDS. As mentioned,
    TDS is measured by a sensor connected to a control program. Besides, TDS in Nutrients
    tanks has been measured in the field periodically. The average resulting TDS from
    the control program and fie1d measurements are compared to the recommended levels
    of TDS during the different growth stages. This comparison ensures that the sensors
    accurately and efficiently send the correct signals to the rest of the control
    devices in the greenhouse to automatically provide the appropriate environment
    based on the growth stage. As mentioned before, the recommended TDS range between
    300 and 400 mg/1 during the seedlings and seeds stage, 500–600 mg/l during vegetative
    growth, and 700–900 mg/1 during advanced vegetative growth [22], [23]. As indicated
    in Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15, the field measured TDS range between 280 and 400
    mg/l, 485–628 mg/l, and 710–913 mg/l for the three stages, respectively. Meanwhile,
    the TDS recorded by the program are 290––420 mg/l, 482–611 mg/l and 683–907 mg/l,
    correspondingly. Thus, the measured and recorded TDS are properly close; in addition,
    they fall within the recommended range for TDS during the different stages. Preliminary
    experiments showed promising results, as; the nutrients are absorbed quicker,
    allowing the plant to grow faster and healthier. Generally, hydroponic and aeroponic
    are media for crop cultivation grown in a controlled environment without soil
    where water and nutrient solution are repeatedly recycled, which allows for optimal
    plant growth and development. They are fed with nutrient-rich water solutions
    that contain all the necessary nutrients (major and minor nutrients) required
    for different plant growth stages. This method of cultivation allows for faster
    growth and higher yields compared to traditional soil-based farming. However,
    the nutritional value of hydroponic and aeroponic crops may differ from those
    grown in normal soil. In nutritional solutions, all elements (used for plant nutrition)
    are in equilibrium and in available form for plant. But in agricultural soils,
    the antagonism between some elements could lead to the precipitation of these
    elements in unavailable forms where the plant couldn’t absorb it. The nutrient
    content of plants is influenced by various factors such as the quality of the
    growing medium, the type of fertilizer used, and the environmental conditions.

    of 80–90% compared to conventiona1 agriculture. For example, Batavia lettuce was
    produced within a month and a half. 5.2. Humidity comparative results Humidity
    control is regarded as an important parameter for effective lettuce growth. Extreme
    humidity reduces transpiration, resulting in reduced nutrient transport. Therefore,
    a relative humidity (RH) of 70 to 80 percent is commonly targeted during lettuce
    growth whi1e reduce from 70 percent during yield. Fig. 16 depicts the RH data
    collected inside and outside the greenhouse. This figure shows that the RH in
    the greenhouse is optimal when compared to the RH outside the greenhouse because
    of the controlled system that allows the plants to evaporate enough water to allow
    the transport of minerals (like Ca) to growing plant cells. Fig. 17 explains how
    boxplots define data inside and outside the greenhouse. Download : Download high-res

    of the best qualities of this lettuce is its resistance to heat. Indeed, Batavia
    lettuce prefers warmth and germinates best at temperatures around 80°Fahrenheit
    as around 30 0c. Most other lettuces cannot germinate or survive in the temperatures
    that Batavia lettuce does. The only disadvantage is that you will have to plant
    these. Fig. 18, Fig. 19 show the temperature data record and boxplot inside and
    outside the greenhouse, respectively. This figure shows that the temperature in
    the greenhouse is optimal when compared to the temperature outside the greenhouse
    due to the controlled system that aids growth. Download : Download high-res image

    Water and energy consumption The amount of water and energy consumed must be monitored
    in order to reduce the overall operating costs of the developed system and to
    make the system power efficient and expandable on a large scale. In terms of water,
    the water consumption in developed system was monitored and recorded during the
    leafy seedling period and the vegetative growth period (45 days). 560 plants were
    used in the study period during April and May. The study period was divided into
    approximately 20 days as the leafy seedling period and 25 days as the vegetative
    growth period. For the leafy seedling period, it was found that the water needs
    per liter for 560 plants in 20 days was about 140 L/day approximately 3 m3, while
    the water needs during the vegetative growth period for 560 plants in 25 days
    was approximately 4 m3. So it was found that the total water consumed during the
    period of leafy seedling and vegetative growth is about 7 m3 for the total area
    (25 m2) in GH. Compared to traditional cultivation, the water use of lettuce was
    estimated at about 965 L per square meter per crop [24], which indicates the efficiency
    of the developed system. On the other hand, in terms of energy, the developed
    system''s power consumption should be monitored using a power meter, which is
    recommended as a future work. However, it should be noted that the use of IoT
    technology reduces the developed system''s power consumption. Since the actuators
    (such as pumps, oil heaters, etc.) on1y run for a short time when the microcontroller
    sends an alarm message, the overall power consumption for these actuators during
    the study period is very low. Taking into account the energy consumed by the oil
    heaters which are the most energy consuming system. They were not continuously
    worked on because the study period is in the summer, and thus their power consumption
    is negligible during the study period. 6. Challenges and limitations There are
    several challenges in the developed smart system such as high initial construction
    cost. Furthermore, the maintenance process of deve1oped system components. In
    addition to the need for qualified technicians to maintain any problem in the
    system, such as any defect in the drip irrigation system, blockage of sprinklers
    or defects in heaters or the cooling pane1, in order to avoid damage or low efficiency
    and productivity for yield. Hence these systems need frequently maintenance which
    requires a high cost. Also, the automation of harvesting in developed system with
    the help of IoT has not been explored. The manual harvesting method may lead to
    the infection of the younger crops with human beings as vectors. Furthermore,
    since the automated system can work tirelessly, it is more economical to use smart
    systems in the harvesting of the crops. In addition, there are some limitations
    that must be taken into account in the developed system, such as power outages,
    as the system will stop working immediately. Plants may quickly dry out and die,
    resulting in some crop loss. It''s crucial to have an alternative power source
    found automatically. Moreover, since the developed system is a closed, water-based
    system, diseases and pests can spread rapid1y as they share a single nutrient
    tank, requiring constant monitoring and treatment of pests. Growers a1so require
    skills and knowledge for commercia1 applications in order to maintain optimal
    production, also they need high marketing skills due to the high prices of system’s
    products. On the other hand, smart hydroponic and aeroponic farming methods are
    not currently feasible for growing strategic and staple crops as rice, wheat,
    and corn on a large scale. While these systems can be used to grow smaller grains
    such as barley, oats, and quinoa, the cost of implementing these systems for large-scale
    production of staple crops like rice, wheat, and corn is currently prohibitive.
    Rice, wheat, and corn are crops considered low value from the economical view
    point comparing to quinoa [25]. Therefore, such crops are planted in agricultural
    lands in Egypt, but in areas (all over the world) where the soil is in scarce,
    the smart aeroponic or hydroponic systems are recommended in such cases. Still,
    more advanced research needs to be conducted to answer the concerns of reduce
    the capital and operating costs for using these smart methods for this type of
    strategic and staple crops for Egypt. 7. Conclusion and future work This paper
    is aimed to introduce some possibilities for improvement of the hydroponic and
    aeroponics systems by utilization of IoT automated greenhouse. Smart architecture
    for the hydroponics and aeroponics greenhouse system was developed. The sensors
    were installed to regularly maintain and control the required humidity concentration
    and the temperature inside the greenhouse based on plant needs. This study evaluated
    the environmental and technical impacts of the developed smart system on the cultivation
    of Batavia lettuce with high economic value. Measured and recorded TDS were compared
    to the recommended values in the different growth stages. It gave accepted TDS
    ranges and approved the high efficiency and accuracy of the automated system.
    The nutrients are absorbed faster, allowing the plant to grow faster and healthier,
    according to preliminary experiments. In addition, when compared to conventional
    agriculture, the developed hydroponic and aeroponic systems using IoT saved 80–90
    percent of water and fertilizer. In addition to doubling productivity per area
    and reducing the time yield to reach 45 days comparing 75 days with the traditional
    agriculture whatever the fertility of the soil. Also, the resulted of Relative
    Humidity (RH), and Temperature (T) as in TDS was analyzed and evaluated during
    the cultivation period with and without the developed smart system, it can notice
    that the RH and T in greenhouse are optimum comparing with it out greenhouse as
    a result of smart controlled system. According to this system, it was found that
    the water use for 560 plants during the period of leafy seedling and vegetative
    growth period is about 7 m3 for total area in GH (25 m2). Compared to traditional
    cultivation, the water use of lettuce was estimated at about 965 L per square
    meter per crop [24], which indicates the efficiency of this system. In addition,
    it is considered the developed smart system are more efficient in terms of yield
    per area and water usage, normalized by yield, than conventional agriculture.
    Also, it can conclude that energy consumption can be mitigated by using cost-effective
    renewable energy sources as a future work. However, more experiments are needed
    and more characteristics of the hydroponics or aeroponics system should be considered.
    Regarding the developed system based on IoT where it provides automated monitoring
    and control of these systems. Also, it can be able to assess the environmental
    and technical effects of the advanced system thus improving water and energy efficiency,
    minimizing cost and saving labor, and reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides.
    Overall, the cost comparison between smart hydroponic and aeroponic systems agriculture
    and traditional agriculture will depend on various factors such as the size of
    the farm, the type of crops grown, the local climate, labor costs, and market
    prices. It is important for farmers to carefully evaluate their options and consider
    all relevant factors before making a decision. In addition, future work will focus
    on finding alternative energy approaches such as a solar power system to power
    an automated greenhouse. As well, use desalinated water to feed hydroponics and
    aeroponics systems. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

  description: Water is the most important role in day-to-day life. Water shortage
    is becoming a reality as water use and pollution continue to grow concern round
    the universe while s o m e reckless individuals waste water on a regular basis
    by overusing it, a large population remains without access to clean drinking water.
    This problem is caused by the irregular distribution of water. To deal with this,
    we need a solution that gives data about water flow rate as well as water use
    of an industrial area or home to the government to enable proper water distribution.
    This paper aims to build a Smart Water Metering System (SWMS) for real-time water
    monitoring. The relatively recent Smart Water Metering (SWM) Technology offers
    high resolution and frequent watering consumption data which may be wont to improve
    water protection and management by providing suggestions to customers. Water is
    one among the vital resources for the existence of human life then the Smart water
    management system features a key role in smart city. Through using moderate Internet
    of thing equipment including mobile applications, a smart metering solution suggested
    varies with standard production techniques. This device requires all Meter Readers
    to use standard devices as single local suppliers to do smart meter and upgrade
    the database of the network. An online tracking system is to provide these data
    on web dB in real-time. The routing protocol increases the reliability of water
    supply and lowers the use of electricity, potential failures and, as a result,
    loss of water supplies, and the alternative methods needed for smart water metering
    have been reviewed. And a design for a Smart water meter is proposed and an implementation
    detail of Smart water metering system is discussed.

    [1]. Agricultural IoT is a network that connects various physical elements including
    animals, plants, the environment, production equipment, and virtual objects in
    agriculture. It enables communication over the internet using agricultural information
    sensing devices and specific protocols. By enabling effective identification,
    location, tracking, and monitoring, its aim is to ensure intelligent management
    of agricultural elements and processes. The interconnection of \"man-machine-object\"
    in agricultural IoT enhances the management of agricultural elements, processes,
    systems, and the understanding of essential aspects of the lives of animals and
    plants. Moreover, it facilitates the management of agricultural emergencies and
    complex agricultural systems [2]. In the agriculture sector, IoT applications
    play a pivotal role, as depicted in Fig. 1. These applications encompass soil
    monitoring to enhance crop growth, efficient irrigation, and fertilizer management.
    Nutrient optimization is crucial to reduce the environmental impact by addressing
    the soil and plant nutrient requirements. Crop monitoring, facilitated by sensors
    and IoT, supports informed decision-making regarding pest control, irrigation,
    and harvesting. Agricultural product storage techniques aid in preserving crops
    and preventing losses. Smart irrigation improves the accuracy of crop watering,
    reduces water wastage, and promotes sustainability. Precision agriculture employs
    drones and sensors for field mapping and precise input application. Finally, IoT
    automates livestock management, including feeding and health data collection.
    Collectively, these IoT applications enhance agricultural efficiency, sustainability,
    profitability, and global food security [3]. Fig. 1. Applications for employing
    IoT technology in the farming domain. Full size image The utilization of agricultural
    data hosted in the cloud as digital evidence is set to streamline administrative
    processes in agriculture in the future. Smart tractors leverage GPS for precise
    steering and optimal route planning, reducing soil erosion and saving fuel. Farmers
    now have the ability to gain in-depth insights into their fields through the use
    of agricultural drones equipped with advanced sensors and cutting-edge imagery.
    These sensors also monitor livestock health and provide alerts aimed at enhancing
    dairy production, as depicted in Fig. 2 [4]. Fig. 2. The Future of Intelligent
    Farming Full size image The integration of the Internet of Things and Artificial
    Intelligence (AIoT) in the field of aquaculture has led to the development of
    smart systems. These systems enhance responsiveness and early warnings by monitoring
    water quality and weather conditions. They have the capability to connect their
    equipment to smart electrical boxes for controlling water wheels, pumps, and other
    power equipment. Utilizing sensors and power data, an AIoT system promotes more
    precise and intelligent aquaculture. This integration results in reduced energy
    consumption, stabilized water quality, decreased labor dependency, and precise
    feeding, ultimately leading to improved aquaculture productivity. Furthermore,
    this approach reduces risks associated with disasters and damages, maximizing
    the benefits of aquaculture. In summary, the IoT and AI significantly contribute
    to the efficiency and sustainability of the aquaculture industry [5]. The core
    issue of this study revolves around exploring the opportunities presented by current
    technologies, specifically the (IoT) and (AI), to optimize the integration of
    existing data. This process aims to enhance water quality monitoring, improve
    fish health, ensure more effective environmental management, optimize agricultural
    operations, and streamline fish stock management while bolstering operational
    efficiency within the context of aquaculture establishments in Morocco. The ultimate
    objective of this endeavor is to stimulate an increase in high-quality fish production
    while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the aquaculture industry. This
    must be accomplished in the face of increasingly stringent environmental constraints
    and growing demand. In essence, the fundamental question we seek to answer is
    as follows: How can we optimize the incorporating of IoT and AI technologies with
    existing data to monitor, regulate, and enhance water quality in Moroccan aquaculture
    facilities, all the while increasing the production of quality fish and securing
    the industry''s viability amidst evolving environmental challenges and dynamic

    markets, hinders crop commercialization. The IoT equipment deployed in farming
    and fish farming are specifically designed to collect meaningful data on various
    environmental and operational parameters. This data is of crucial importance for
    improving agricultural practices, optimizing aquaculture management, and increasing
    crop and livestock productivity. However, despite the potential benefits they
    offer, IoT-based agricultural systems face issues and limitations that need to
    be overcome for broader and more effective adoption. These devices provide valuable
    information on various parameters to enhance agricultural practices and boost
    crop productivity. Nevertheless, they continue to encounter obstacles and limitations
    that must be addressed. The primary challenges hindering the adoption of smart
    agricultural applications include, as depicted in Fig. 5, various types of obstacles
    [20]. Fig. 5. Challenges in the implementation of IoT in smart farming. Full size

    Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the increasing demand
    for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation have proven to
    be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The concept of aquaponics,
    a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an alternative solution to
    sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system where fish and plants
    are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic relationship where the
    waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and the plants clean the
    water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates by bacteria present
    in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants. This system also provides
    the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply as compared to traditional
    irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic way of irrigation conserves
    as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional irrigation systems.
    It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system because nutrients are
    readily available to them and they do not have to expend energy searching for
    them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment of an aquaponics system
    provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making it a superior option for
    growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples of tap water as well
    as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity, and water temperature.
    The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on various factors such as
    the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life, and the weather conditions.
    In general, lake water can have a lower or higher pH level than tap water, depending
    on the lake''s distinctive characteristics and the way the local area''s tap water
    is treated. For instance, tap water is usually treated to have a pH level between
    6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe for human consumption and does not cause
    corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring presence of suspended particles like
    silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause it to have a greater turbidity level
    than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware design of one system [1] includes
    various components such as sensors, actuators, relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino,
    and routers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity is accomplished using
    an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield, an FC-28 humidity sensor, and
    a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized to connect the Arduino Ethernet
    to a server. The relay module functions as a control switch for various actuators,
    which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic box contains several actuators,
    such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker, a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light
    lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept track of numerous environmental
    factors, and over time it would be able to control how the farm operated and create
    a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes), brokers (local servers), and subscribers
    (local servers) all communicated via the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use
    of any data type. Monitoring can also be done with the help of a GUI program,
    a communication network, and [3] wireless sensors. A graphical user interface
    is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned issues. Farmers can get real-time
    notifications and advice about water quality even when they are not there by using
    AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT technology. When compared to the conventional
    approach, the introduction of the AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics
    system has shown substantial gains. Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate
    many characteristics observed by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics.
    A ZigBee module [5] can be used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the
    data gathered by the Arduino while also displaying the values on the LCD without
    performing any control actions. A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that
    simulates the sun''s rays for plant growth make up the aquaponics system described
    in [6]. The fish waste provides nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive
    water from the fish tank as a filter. The system makes use of actuators to operate
    the water pump, light panel, heater, and oxygen provider as well as sensors to
    monitor and control pH levels, temperature, and humidity. To direct the actual
    citrus production process, nutrient monitoring [7] in citrus plants can also be
    done in real time according to the soil situation. Another method that primarily
    focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies in image processing [8]
    in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional deficiencies. A
    Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid valves make
    up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method can help in
    the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing many
    sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level [9].
    Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

    1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture – food security, gross domestic product, world
    population, and climate change Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food
    security and has a significant impact Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.
    With the projected increase the global population, there will be a greater need
    for agricultural production (FAO et al., 2022). The need for food will in-fact
    rise significantly as the world''s population continues to grow. Also, it is expected
    that the world population will surpass 10 billion by 2050. To fulfil the increased
    demand caused by population growth, food production must increase by almost 70
    % (Giller et al., 2021). For agriculture to satisfy this need, it must adapt and
    expand. However, due to additional difficulties brought about by climate change
    and water constraints, existing agricultural methods are no longer enough to supply
    this expanding need (Elijah et al., 2018). 1.2. Smart agriculture – sustainability,
    production, and resources Smart agriculture is rapidly implementing contemporary
    technology to address these issues and boost production and sustainability (Ahmed
    et al., 2018, Lindgren et al., 2018). For instance, a recent scientific field
    called “smart irrigation” employs data-intensive techniques to maximize water
    consumption and boost agricultural production. Farmers may gain useful information
    from sensors and data analytics in agriculture to better understand how their
    actions affect the soil. Farmers may use data gleaned from environmental parameter
    monitoring and analysis to improve practices, make well-informed decisions about
    resource use, and identify crop problems early on. This improves sustainability
    and creates a deeper comprehension of the link between farming and land (Idoje
    et al., 2021, Ojha et al., 2015). Technology in agriculture is essential for resource
    conservation, reducing the environmental effect of farming operations, and feeding
    the world''s population. With the advent of the digital age, sophisticated technologies
    are replacing old farming techniques. These systems provide enormous quantities
    of data that may be used to optimize resources used and boost agricultural output.
    Hence, the use of technology and data-driven decision-making in agriculture will
    boost productivity, decrease waste, and protect the planet''s natural resources
    (Weersink et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2021). Agriculture, not only plays a crucial
    part in providing food security and sustainability, but it also significantly
    contributes to a nation''s economic development (Beckman and Countryman, 2021).
    As was already established, agriculture has a big influence on a country''s GDP.
    1.3. Agriculture, economic, innovative technology, scope, and possible potential
    of the paper In reality, throughout history, agriculture has been a key factor
    in the economic success of numerous nations. In rural regions, especially agriculture,
    not only produces food but also, opens doors to employment. For farmers and those
    who work in the agricultural value chain, such as processors, marketers, and exporters,
    it is a significant source of revenue. As a result, agriculture has the ability
    to promote economic expansion, reduce poverty, and improve living conditions.
    Investments in innovative agriculture technology have the potential to accelerate
    economic growth. Farmers can boost their earnings, produce more food with fewer
    resources, and open new markets for their goods with the aid of modern agricultural
    systems and smart technology (Bathaei and Štreimikienė, 2023, Blakeney, 2022).
    In light of the economic considerations and the imperative to optimize the use
    of this vital resource, the implementation of computerized smart systems in North
    Africa and worldwide has become crucial (Assouli et al., 2018). The proposed paper
    presents an advanced smart irrigation system that aims to revolutionize agricultural
    efficiency and increase yields. With a broad scope that includes innovative irrigation
    technologies and cutting-edge technological applications such as the Internet
    of Things, cloud computing, and embedded system, the paper focuses on improving
    food security. Through potential stability and the promotion of sustainable agricultural
    practices, the study also envisages a future in agriculture contributing to the
    promotion of global food stability. 1.4. Intelligent irrigation – internet, deep
    Learning, Machine Learning, and motivation of this work The intelligent irrigation,
    utilizing state-of-the-art technology like Internet-integrated systems, plays
    a pivotal role in collecting precise data (such as temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture), this helps in demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications,
    and facilitating remote control (Rahman et al., 2020, Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba
    et al., 2019, Munir et al., 2021). Consequently, the utilization of the Internet
    in recent years reflects significant advancements in integrated systems, particularly
    in developed nations, leading to remarkable improvements in water conservation
    and production efficiency (Abi Saab et al., 2019, Pasika and Gandla, 2020). Additionally,
    the emergence of cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, machine learning,
    and artificial intelligence in agriculture contributes further to the maintenance
    and boost of the outcome (Talaviya et al., 2020, Saleem et al., 2021, Subeesh
    and Mehta, 2021). Motivated by global food security concerns, this research focuses
    on irrigation. Meeting the food needs of a growing population while preserving
    water resources is of paramount importance. Current traditional irrigation practices
    affect yields and food security. The study proposes an intelligent irrigation
    system that integrates IoT and cloud technologies. This innovation makes it possible
    to conserve water efficiently, increase yields, and feed crops well. With broad
    global application, this approach advances smart farming, helping to improve food
    security and sustainability. 1.5. Smart irrigation, Internet of Things, ThingSpeak,
    and focus of this work Numerous cutting-edge technologies, including the IoT,
    have broad applications. It is hard for farmers to personally visit and monitor
    every part of the farms they oversee, which might result in inconsistent watering.
    Losses in money and poor crop quality are consequently a result of this. In order
    to solve this problem and streamline the agricultural process, the research papers
    (Ayaz et al., 2019, Habib et al., 2023), suggest an intelligent irrigation system
    that makes use of cutting-edge IoT technology. These studies (Kamienski et al.,
    2019, García et al., 2020), also introduce the concept of “smart agriculture,”
    which makes use of data technology to increase agricultural output and raise the
    overall quality. Furthermore, the mentioned works (Pathak et al., 2019, Ndunagu
    et al., 2022), make use of the ThingSpeak platform, which provides a complete
    solution for gathering and storing data acquired from agricultural sensors and
    controllers, to meet the needs of farm operators. This portal is a useful resource
    for collecting and preserving important agricultural data. Wireless sensor networks
    are utilized by these papers while creating autonomous plants. By using a smart
    irrigation system, irrigation settings may be managed automatically (Tiglao et
    al., 2020, Lloret et al., 2021, Zervopoulos et al., 2020, Morchid et al., 2022,
    Morchid et al., 2021). In these studies (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et
    al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), a water level sensor was utilized.
    Specifically, The HC-SR04 device of the real-time water level monitoring system
    is used to accurately measure the water level as a key component. Further, this
    study presented a review of applications of IoT and sensor technology to increase
    food security and agricultural sustainability (Morchid et al., 2024). The focus
    of this study is to provide a smart irrigation system that that would use cloud
    computing and embedded IoT technologies to optimize water utilization and make
    sure plants get the right quantity of water. The research shows how this method
    might increase agricultural yields, decrease water waste, and assist offset the
    problem of food security. The system''s feasibility for application in many places
    around the world is also emphasized in this paper, supporting the progress of
    smart agriculture. 1.6. Main contribution of this work The main contribution of
    this paper is expressed as follows. Fig. 1 also shows the graphical abstract of
    the proposed scheme based on these contributions. • A smart irrigation system
    is proposed using new technologies like the IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing
    as a groundbreaking strategy to improve food security through the implementation
    of advanced agricultural technology. • The proposed system supervises real-time
    monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and water levels in smart agriculture practices. • The proposed system also employs
    state-of-the-art sensors which includes the (1) humidity and temperature sensor
    module (DHT22), (2) water level sensor, and (3) moisture sensors. All these sensors
    are connected to the widely-used embedded system (ESP32). The system uses the
    ThingSpeak cloud to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm
    owner, enhancing their interaction. • Farmers can access comprehensive farm data
    from anywhere in the world as the sensor data is transmitted in real-time to both
    the ThingSpeak cloud and the ThingView application. This capability allows for
    more precise crop irrigation and increased production. • The proposed scheme also

    the water level sensor in percentage. This smart irrigation system was created
    using the V model software development approach. • The suggested solution in this

    It is more efficient and environmentally friendly since it prevents drowning crops
    and draining water beds. • The proposed article also examines the effects of smart
    irrigation on agricultural sustainability and its impact on food security. Download

    Paper framework of the paper. 2. Architecture of the proposed scheme Smart irrigation
    systems gather information on soil moisture and other parameters using several
    IoT devices and sensors. These sensors can detect the moisture content of the
    soil, temperature, humidity, and even water level. They can also capture images
    of the crops to track their development and general health. Remote control of
    an irrigation system using data obtained from sensors and wireless communication
    with a cloud-based platform for analysis. The data is processed and analyzed on
    a cloud-based platform which makes use of models and algorithms to find the best
    watering plan depending on the information gathered. The irrigation system is
    connected to a small computer called an embedded board which can regulate the
    irrigation system''s water flow depending on instructions. Through a mobile application,
    farmers can access and monitor the system, which gives them real-time information
    on the soil moisture, weather, and irrigation schedule. Through the app, they
    may manually operate the irrigation system or modify the watering schedule. Farmers
    can increase agricultural yields and optimize irrigation thanks to this. As it
    only supplies the crops with the water they require, this technology also conserves
    water resources and lowers expenses. Furthermore, crop planning and research may
    be done using the data gathered by the smart irrigation system. Farmers, for instance,
    might spot trends in crop growth and pinpoint the perfect circumstances for a
    certain crop by examining data collected over time. Future agricultural yield
    optimization and crop planting schedule decisions may both be made using this
    knowledge. In the context of smart irrigation, wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    enable autonomous plant management through functions such as environmental monitoring,
    nutrient management, disease detection, automated irrigation, and communications.
    Wireless sensor networks provide real-time data on factors such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, water level, and nutrient levels. They support adaptive
    control systems, use low-power nodes for greater energy efficiency, and enable
    remote monitoring and control through cloud integration. Overall, WSNs contribute
    to the creation of autonomous plants by facilitating data-driven decision-making
    and optimizing plant conditions to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    On the other hand, the integration of various sensors into WSNs is essential for
    plant autonomy. The most common sensors are those measuring temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, light, nutrients, pests, water levels, and wind. Collectively,
    these sensors help improve plant-related processes. The integration of various
    sensors improves the accuracy and efficiency of autonomous plant management systems,
    enabling informed decisions to be made to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    2.1. The architecture of the system This section describes the structure of the
    smart irrigation system shown in Fig. 3. The system is made up of three essential
    parts: IoT devices, cloud computing, and application interface. Internet connectivity
    enables consumers from all around the world to view and track their farm data.

    Fig. 3. The smart irrigation system''s IoT architecture. The irrigation system
    is an automated electronic system that is intended to efficiently manage irrigation
    scheduling. Its primary goal is to accommodate the changing needs of plants as
    they develop. Through the analysis of soil moisture content, the system determines
    the precise percentage of water necessary for irrigation, ensuring accurate scheduling
    for various agricultural seasons and crop varieties. The key aims of smart irrigation
    encompass optimizing water consumption to reduce costs, enhancing agricultural
    productivity, benefiting farms, fostering energy efficiency, and ensuring food
    security through utilizing new technologies like the IoT, cloud computing, embedded
    systems, and sensors. The IoT architecture of the proposed system, shown in Fig.
    3, comprises three fundamental components: (1) IoT devices, (2) cloud computing,
    and (3) the application interface. The components of IoT devices include sensors,
    actuators, a control unit, and a gateway, among others. These sensors are in charge
    of monitoring critical environmental factors including air humidity, air temperature,
    soil moisture, and water level within the smart farm. The soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure the soil moisture content. In addition, the DHT22 device, which
    is famous for its accuracy, was used, which is a two-in-one combined sensor to
    measure humidity and temperature. In addition, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance
    sensor is used to detect water levels. The ESP32 microcontroller-powered control
    unit receives sensor readings and coordinates the actuators to make sure that
    the plants are watered on schedule. The ESP32 microcontroller is appropriate for
    larger-scale applications since it has adequate memory capacity and improved processing
    capability. The smart irrigation system''s actuators are essential for carrying
    out instructions from the ESP32 controller. In our system, a water sprinkler is
    used to water the plants, and a water pump is used to fill the tank. The next
    development in the IoT device architecture is the addition of a gateway. The gateway
    gathers sensed data from the control unit and carries out critical data processing
    operations to enable intelligent aggregation, optimize network traffic, and lower
    energy consumption. It effectively bundles the essential components of the particular
    process model and sends them to the cloud, leading to appreciable decreases in
    latency and costs at higher levels. The data is continually processed by conventional
    cloud computing systems when it is received from the gateway. Cloud computing
    is the focus of our system architecture''s second component. Farmers now have
    access to a huge variety of data that was gathered through the control unit and
    delivered over the gateway console, thanks to this layer. Farmers may gather,
    view, and analyze real-time data streams by utilizing the cloud-based IoT analytics
    platform ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is a complete data management platform that enables
    farmers to design unique data visualizations using their own technology. The platform
    allows for the collection, visualization, analysis, and derivation of useful insights
    from live data streams. Using the ThingSpeak platform to post data or the ThingView
    app to retrieve data, farmers may communicate with the system. The irrigation
    system architecture is completed by the application interface, often known as
    the front layer. Results of data processing, such as soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature, and water level, are shown in this user-facing component. Farmers
    may get real-time data visualizations using ThingSpeak and use the knowledge to
    guide their decisions. This interface makes it possible for the farmer and the
    system to communicate seamlessly, which makes it easier to monitor and manage
    the irrigation systems. 2.2. Calibration of the water level In this section, the
    sensor calibration method is employed in the proposed work. The HC SR04 device
    was utilized to measure the water level. Several studies (Olisa et al., 2021,
    Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), have employed
    an ultrasonic sensor to determine the water level. However, these papers did not
    provide a mathematical calculation for the calibration procedure of the ultrasonic
    sensor used to measure the water level. In the proposed study, a calibration technique
    is utilized to study the water level sensor. This technique involves a linear
    interpolation function, referred to as the water level sensor calibration, which
    establishes a relationship between the sensor''s values and the corresponding
    water level. (1) expresses this relationship in a linear formula. Specifically,
    when the maximum value of the sensor is represented in centimeters, the minimum
    value corresponds to the %, and vice versa. Fig. 4 visually illustrates this relationship
    between the sensor''s values and the water level in %. Download : Download high-res
    image (183KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Architecture of the
    water level calibration. The calibration process was used to accurately adjust
    the input of the ultrasonic sensor. The sensor is connected to the ESP32 Microcontroller
    for seamless integration and data processing. During the system startup, we obtain
    synchronized sensor data for a duration of 2 sec. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough
    analysis of the system, focusing on the highest and lowest values of the sensor
    readings. The HC-SR04 device is capable of measuring distances ranging from 2
    cm to 400 cm. Equation (1) represents the mathematical interpolation function
    used to detect the water level in percentages, such as 5 %, 30 %, etc. This linear
    interpolation representation of our proposed system is as follows: (1) In the
    given linear interpolation (1), the variables used are defined as follows: Y:
    Output of the water level in %. X: Input of the water level in cm. m: Coefficient.
    P: Zero adjustment. The coefficient may be computed as in equation (2) if we assume
    that the difference between the highest and minimum values is equal to the h2
    described in equation (3). Consequently, level Y is equal to 1 when X is equal
    to the maximum value (Max). Further context or computation can be used to calculate
    the value of P, which represents zero adjustments as flow in equation (4). (2)
    (3) (4) In the proposed paper, it has been determined that the maximum distance
    in the water tank is 25 cm, and the minimum reading is h1 = 5 cm. Therefore, based
    equation (3) the difference between the maximum and minimum values (h2) is calculated
    as h2 = Max - Min = 25 cm − 5 cm = 20 cm. Using this information, the coefficient
    (m) can be calculated as m = -99/h2 = −99/20 = −4.95. (4) is obtained as follows:
    (4) For instance, if X  = Min = h1 = 5 cm, the value of the water level (Y) will
    be 99 %. On the other hand, if X  = Max = 25 cm, the water level value will be
    0 %. The discussion of this study towards the linear interpolation has important
    implications for sustainable agriculture, smart irrigation systems, and food security.
    This representation permits precise detection of water levels at various places
    in a tank or reservoir by creating a link between the values of the water level
    sensor and corresponding percentages. This interpolation may be used by smart
    irrigation systems to optimize water use and enhance agricultural operations.
    Farmers and system controllers can plan irrigation and manage water resources
    more effectively by continually monitoring the water levels. The system can deliver
    the proper quantity of water to crops using this real-time data, preventing over-
    or under-irrigation. This strategy offers two advantages. Firstly, it promotes
    sustainability and ensures that just the appropriate amount of water is delivered,
    therefore conserving water resources. Secondly, the representation helps to preserve
    crop health and production, enhancing food security, by precisely determining
    water levels. According to the mathematical calibration technique presented in
    this article, integrating linear interpolation into the smart irrigation system
    offers significant advantages. The accuracy of the water level sensor is significantly
    increased by this mathematical calibration technique, providing reliable information
    for making informed irrigation decisions. By enabling the system to accurately
    assess soil moisture levels, thereby reducing the risks associated with over-
    or under-watering, the use of linear interpolation improves overall irrigation
    planning. In particular, by reducing water wastage and complying with sustainable
    farming methods, this strategy improves resource efficiency. Linearization also
    improves accuracy. In addition, the approach increases the reliability of data-driven
    decision-making of the smart irrigation system, which in turn fosters stakeholder
    confidence in the accuracy of the system to make well-informed and effective management
    decisions. Linear interpolation effectively optimizes agricultural operations
    by precisely calibrating the sensors, particularly water level sensors, in the
    smart irrigation system presented in this paper. This enhancement enables better
    irrigation scheduling, guaranteeing accurate soil moisture measurements and reducing
    water wastage. The result is greater resource efficiency, in line with sustainable
    practices. What''s more, improved precision has a positive impact on crop productivity,
    promoting plant health and increasing overall agricultural output. This section
    includes a method for calibrating the water level sensor that will provide farmers
    with accurate results. This calibration technique optimizes the possibilities
    of seamless and secure soil irrigation management by facilitating effective process
    control. This strategy differs noticeably from the approaches put forward by authors
    (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020). 3. Algorithm and V-model of
    the proposed scheme The algorithmic aspect of the proposed approach comprises
    three essential elements. It begins with a visual flowchart illustrating how the
    method works. Next, it explains the process of accessing the ESP32 station and
    establishing a Wi-Fi connection. Finally, it presents the pseudo-code, details
    of the system equipment, and V Model. This combination of algorithmic representation
    and equipment information is a valuable resource for researchers, developers,
    and enthusiasts who want to understand how the system works. 3.1. Flow chart of
    the proposed scheme The smart irrigation system algorithm created particularly
    for smart agriculture is shown in detail in Fig. 5. The algorithm encompasses
    all stages of the software code, beginning with the initialization of the sensors
    and ending with the display of sensors data on both the ThingSpeak platform and
    the ThingView application. Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Flow chart of the proposed smart irrigation
    system. The initialization of the temperature, humidity, moisture, and water level
    sensors is the first step in our system''s flow chart in order to get correct
    values from these sensors. The sensor parameters are adjusted as needed after
    initialization to ensure accurate readings. Next, the system checks if the ESP32
    microcontroller, the ESP32 used in the system, is connected to the ThingSpeak
    cloud. If not, the system tries connection with the cloud. Additionally, the sensor
    data is printed on the console for monitoring purposes. For the moisture sensor,
    if the reading falls below 40 %, indicating a low moisture level in the soil,
    the watering pump (W-Pump) is activated, and the green LED indicator is turned
    on. Conversely, if the reading exceeds 40 %, the pump remains switched off. The
    DHT22 sensor, responsible for measuring air temperature and humidity, continuously
    reads the values every 2 s while checking for any potential errors. If the temperature
    reading exceeds 45 °C, indicating a high temperature, the yellow LED is illuminated;
    otherwise, the yellow LED remains off. In the case of the water level sensor,
    if the reading indicates a level below 10 %, indicating a low water level in the
    tank, the tank pump (T-Pump) is activated, and the red LED is turned on. Conversely,
    if the reading is above 10 %, the tank pump remains off, and the red LED remains
    unlit. Every 2 s, the suggested smart irrigation system''s data is updated (2S).
    On the LCD, the sensors'' whole output is shown in real time. The system also
    instantly transmits all sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app.
    In order to provide accurate and current information on the system''s performance,
    the data is updated every 2 s. Overall, this Smart Irrigation System makes sure
    that plants and crops receive enough water, and it runs well with little assistance
    from humans. In addition, this flow chart makes sure that the sensors are working
    properly, checks their readings, and initiates the required actions in response
    to predetermined thresholds, as shown by the activation of pumps and indicators.
    3.2. Accessing ESP32 station and Wi-Fi connection process 3.2.1. Accessing ESP32
    station The embedded system (ESP32) is typically linked to a wireless router,
    which acts as an access point for the ESP32 to connect to the local network in
    these situations. In most cases, the ESP32 is set up as a station, enabling it
    to connect to the router and access the network. In this setup, we would need
    toc be connected to the same local network as the ESP32 in order to control it.
    This implies that we may operate the ESP32 from any device that is also linked
    to the same network, such as IoT embedded systems (including other ESP32 devices),
    IoT gateways (which may include routers), and IoT terminals like PCs or smartphones
    as illustrated in Fig. 6. Our system can access and manage the ESP32 from anywhere
    in the range of that network as long as these devices are linked to it. Download

    the design process for creating a Wi-Fi connection adheres to. The ESP32 microcontroller
    is initially initialized to guarantee good operation. The system then confirms
    that the microcontroller is effectively linked to a Wi-Fi network. The information
    is swiftly and in real-time delivered to the ThingSpeak cloud platform after the
    connection has been verified. As shown in Fig. 7, this guarantees that all sensor-generated
    data is easily accessed and shown on the ThingSpeak platform and the associated
    ThingView application. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download : Download

    and equipment of the system In order to program, develop, and visualize the algorithm''s
    structure, the pseudo-code is supplied below. The algorithm for the suggested
    irrigation system is shown in Table 1. This pseudo-code defines the simulation
    of intelligent irrigation based on an embedded system that monitors environmental
    conditions, controls pumps, and communicates with the cloud (The ThingSpeak platform
    and the ThingView application). It starts by defining constants for the different
    thresholds in lines 1–2. The program uses variables to represent sensor readings,
    pump states, and connection status in lines 3–11. Initialise built-in devices
    such as ESP32 and sensors in lines 12–13. Table 1. Algorithm 1. Pseudo-code of

    moisture, water level) are (1) simulated, although actual sensor data is used
    in practice. (2) The humidity sensor reading is calibrated on a percentage scale.
    (3) The water level is calculated by linear interpolation. (4) The simulated data
    is sent to the cloud platforms (ThingSpeak and ThingView) for visualization and
    analysis. (5) The state of the connection to the cloud is simulated. (6) Control
    logic evaluates humidity and water levels to determine pump conditions. (7) Pump
    control flags (TonWP, ToffWP, TonTP, ToffTP) are set based on the control logic
    conditions. (8) A simulation delay has been introduced between iterations. The
    code uses placeholder functions to read sensors, set values, and check connectivity
    to the cloud. These functions need to be implemented to interact with real devices
    and services. In general, this pseudo-code demonstrates the logic of the system
    that collects sensor data, communicates with the cloud (ThingSpeak and ThingView),
    and controls pumps according to predefined thresholds. Table 2 briefly gives the
    hardware components used in this design, and explains the particular uses for
    which it was used. It includes the controllers, sensors, pumps, and other devices
    used in this system. Table 2. The equipment of the system. Sr. no Hardware Functions
    1. ESP32 Microcontroller The ESP32 is a flexible microcontroller with a variety
    of features and capabilities. It may be used in combination with a host MCU as
    a secondary device or as an independent system. Reduced communication stack overhead
    on the main application processor is one of its main benefits. The ESP32 can also
    communicate with other systems, allowing the inclusion of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
    features via SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces. Because of its adaptability, the
    ESP32 is a potent tool for several applications. 2. DHT22 (AM2302) It is a two-in-one
    combination sensor for measuring ambient air humidity and temperature, all with
    high accuracy. 3. Soil Moisture Sensor A device used to detect moisture or water
    content in the soil. Farmers and gardeners use the information to make informed
    decisions about watering and watering schedules by gaining vital insight into
    soil moisture content. 4. HC-SR04 – Ultrasonic Distance Sensor The device is used
    to measure and monitor the water level within a tank, giving vital data for effective
    water management. 5. Tank Pump The tank pump was employed to recharge the tank
    when it became empty. This device contributes to the system''s continued operating
    effectiveness and offers a dependable water source for irrigation needs. 6. Watering
    Pump The watering pump is responsible for irrigating the soil by delivering water
    to the plants 7. Relay_1 A relay was utilized to activate the tank pump for tank
    refilling when it becomes empty. 8. Relay_2 A relay was used to control the watering
    pump responsible for soil irrigation. 9. Power Supply Powering all of the system''s
    components with electrical energy is the power source''s main duty. This power
    source acts as the system''s main energy source, supplying each component with
    the energy it needs to operate properly, including the sensors, actuators, controllers,
    and communication modules. By providing dependable power, the system can function
    without interruption, making it possible to complete activities like data gathering,
    processing, and communication successfully. 3.4. V Model of the smart irrigation
    system A crucial element of our approach is the integration of sensor and control
    system data into the V model, which guides the development of the best irrigation
    program. Within the framework of the V model, which is a software development
    methodology, we have created an intelligent irrigation system exploiting the IoT
    and an integrated board such as the ESP32. This board transmits data to the cloud,
    including platforms such as ThingSpeak, and enables remote monitoring via the
    ThingView application. As shown in Fig. 8 the exact ways to apply the V model,
    in this case, are as follows: (1) Requirements Gathering and Analysis: The requirements
    for the system are gathered and examined at this stage of the V Model. This involves
    identifying the system''s users, such as farmers and agricultural engineers, their
    requirements and goals (such as automating irrigation based on weather and soil
    conditions and sending data to the cloud for remote monitoring and analysis),
    as well as any limitations that must be taken into account (such as cost, and
    compatibility with existing equipment). (2) System Design: The system architecture
    and general design are developed at this stage. This entails a choice of sensors
    to track soil moisture, temperature, and water level, an embedded board such as
    ESP32 to collect and process sensor data, and a wireless communication module
    such as Wi-Fi to transmit sensor data to a remote server or a cloud-based platform
    such as ThingSpeak. Designing the control system that will be used to create the
    ideal irrigation schedule is also part of this phase. (3) Implementation: The
    integration of sensor and control system data into the Model V is a crucial step
    in the implementation of our intelligent irrigation system. At this stage, the
    system is activated, the control system is configured and the integrated board,
    such as the ESP32, is programmed. A connection to the cloud is established, enabling
    the irrigation system to be monitored and operated remotely. It''s important to
    note that this phase also includes the integration of sensor data into the control
    system, enabling the best irrigation program to be determined. The code practice
    for sending sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud platform is also implemented during
    this stage. This seamless integration of components guarantees optimum system
    efficiency, enabling precise, responsive management of the irrigation program
    according to environmental conditions and specific crop needs. (4) Verification:
    To make sure the system satisfies the criteria established in step one, this stage
    entails testing it. Functional testing, performance testing, and integration testing
    are all part of this. The communication between the embedded board and the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform as well as the communication between the embedded board and the
    remote server or cloud-based platform are both tested at this stage. (5) Maintenance:
    The deployment of the system and any required upkeep and upgrades are done in
    this final phase of the V Model. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the
    system''s operation and making any required modifications. Additionally, it entails
    testing the connectivity, upgrading the firmware, and making sure that new software
    versions are compatible. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the information
    transmitted to ThingSpeak and resolving any transmission problems. Download :

    model for smart irrigation system. Using an ESP32 microcontroller with large memory
    capacity and enhanced processing capability confers several advantages, especially
    in the area of our smart irrigation system. The selection of an ESP32 microcontroller
    with robust memory capacity and processing capability improves the efficiency,
    responsiveness, and adaptability of our smart irrigation system, supporting the
    optimization of irrigation of crops and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
    4. Results and discussion In this section, we provide a detailed analysis of the
    proposed Smart Irrigation System, including its results and efficiency compared
    to existing scientific papers. We also look at how the system affects agricultural
    sustainability and how it helps provide food security. The innovation of this
    study lies in its integration of cutting-edge technology like embedded system
    cloud computing and the IoT. The system makes it possible to monitor and manage
    irrigation operations in real-time by leveraging IoT devices, sensors, and actuators.
    Utilizing cloud computing enables data storage, analysis, and decision-making,
    which results in enhanced irrigation control and optimum water utilization. This
    novel strategy transforms conventional approaches by improving irrigation operations''
    accuracy, efficacy, and sustainability. Efficiently sent to ThingSpeak platforms
    and the ThingView app, data from simulated sensors represent environmental parameters
    such as temperature and humidity. Data is provided securely regularly, simulating
    sensor updates in real-time, using the MQTT protocol for communication. Cloud
    platforms can be configured to accurately visualize data using graphs and charts,
    enabling real-time monitoring and analysis, just like with field data. 4.1. Experimental
    results The experimental results of the proposed irrigation system are presented
    in Table 3. The table provides continuous measurements of various parameters including
    soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, as well as outputs from the water level
    sensor in centimeters and the water level in percentages. These measurements were
    recorded over a period of seven days. Additionally, Table 3 includes information
    on the status of data transmission to the platform and app, indicating whether
    the data was successfully sent, and the response time of 2 s. It should be noted
    that the weather conditions during the data collection period were normal, with
    no rainfall. These comprehensive measurements provide valuable insights into the
    performance of the smart system, showcasing the variations in soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and water level over the seven-day period. Such data is critical for
    optimizing irrigation strategies and ensuring efficient water management in agricultural
    practices. Cloud computing, in particular the integration of the MathWorks laboratory
    into the ThingSpeak platform of our intelligent irrigation system, improves data
    storage, analysis, and irrigation control decision-making through scalable storage,
    remote access to all data, and real-time analytics on ThingSpeak. This contributes
    to cost-effectiveness, improved security, collaborative management, reliability,
    efficient data processing, collaborative decision-making, and good results. Table

    presents a method for calibrating the moisture sensor used in the research. To
    calibrate the moisture sensor input, a two-point calibration method was used in
    the studies (Ndunagu et al., 2022, Tiglao et al., 2020). Moisture sensor data
    were taken during the first 2 s of the system loop, indicating the lowest and
    maximum predicted values of the readings. The function moisture = map (moisture,
    4095, 2413, 0, 100) was used to do a two-point calibration on the moisture sensor''s
    natural outputs. The function mapping approach is used in the demonstration section
    to calibrate the humidity sensor. A few configurations must be made before the
    ESP32 Microcontroller can be started. The moisture sensor''s minimum and maximum
    readings are defined specifically. Values for the moisture sensor vary from a
    minimum of 4095 to a high of 2413. A function is used to transform the sensor
    value from 0 % to 100 %, with 100 % indicating the maximum value, in order to
    make the reading procedure easier for consumers. The user-friendly interpretation
    of the sensor readings is ensured by this change. Two-point calibration is of
    significant importance in the calibration process of the moisture sensor of our
    intelligent irrigation system. This method involves calibrating the sensor to
    two different moisture levels, typically representing the extremes of the moisture
    spectrum. The importance of using a two-point calibration method lies in its ability
    to improve accuracy, account for variability in soil conditions, account for dynamic
    moisture ranges and allow customization for specific agricultural applications.
    This meticulous calibration approach is fundamental to ensuring the efficiency
    of the smart irrigation system in optimizing water. 4.2. Results on the platform
    in real-time The ThingSpeak cloud receives data obtained by our system. So we
    can use our mobile app or our PC to obtain or download it for free using the platform
    ThingSpeak or the app ThingView. Fig. 9 shows some farm temperature readings displayed
    on the ThingSpeak. The farm owner can now connect to the cloud and see the graphical
    output to check the status of the farm. The maximum value of the temperature read
    is 25.5 °C, and the minimum value is 24.9 °C. On the ThingSpeak platform, Fig.
    10 displays some on-farm air humidity data. The maximum value of the humidity
    read is 35.00 % and the minimum value is 39.4 %. The farm owner may now connect
    to the cloud and examine the farm''s status using the graphical output. Download

    farm is shown in Fig. 11 on ThingSpeak. It shows that the soil was initially dry.
    When the water pump was turned on, the moisture sensor registered around 80 %.
    The range of soil moisture measured ranged from 0 % to 82 %. On the other hand,
    Fig. 12 illustrates how the water level was around 80 % when the irrigation water
    pump was switched on, which caused the water storage to be depleted. The data
    from the moisture sensors combined with the observations of the water level sheds
    light on the dynamic interaction between soil moisture levels, water pump performance,
    and water storage management and offers useful insights into the irrigation process.
    These findings support wise agricultural practices by enabling informed decision-making
    and effective water resource management. Download : Download high-res image (89KB)

    real-time. Every 2 s, the ESP32 microcontroller sends data on the temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level to the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform.
    The farmer may easily access this information via the ThingSpeak channel, giving
    them a simple and precise way to keep an eye on their field. Additionally, the
    data may be exported to an Excel document using the ThingSpeak channel''s “export
    recent data” function, enabling additional analysis and investigation. Additionally,
    an application called ThingView, which is available for free download from the
    Google Play Store, makes it simple to retrieve the data from ThingSpeak on mobile
    devices. The farm owner may remotely access all the data with this smartphone
    application, making it simple and convenient to manage the irrigation system.
    The use of this smart irrigation system is essential because it guarantees precise
    and timely irrigation of agricultural plants, creating the ideal environment for
    plant growth. The field or farm owner''s overall farming experience is considerably
    improved by this method. Further, implementing our smart irrigation system requires
    a high level of technical expertise. The system is designed and implemented by
    specialists before being delivered to farmers. Farmers, meanwhile, benefit from
    a ready-to-use system that requires a minimum of technical knowledge for daily
    operations. The graphical display of the smart irrigation system includes needle
    values that represent the real-time sensor data. Colored sections can be applied
    to various measurement sites (widgets) to improve clarity. A red number on the
    water sensor in the tank, which indicates that the water level is critically low,
    is an example of how red color is used to indicate danger. As illustrated in Fig.
    13, the green color denotes no problems, whereas the yellow color stands in the
    center of problems and no problems, indicating the start of a potentially troublesome
    period. The solution also enables tracking of channel locations and particular
    modifications to channel content. In order to do this, a channel sitemap is created,
    which details the placement of feed data. By inputting the latitude and longitude
    coordinates in the “Channel settings” tab of the channel view, the channel location
    may be displayed. The channel map of our system is shown in Fig. 14, which gives
    a summary of the data''s spatial distribution. These functions and visual representations
    help users gain a deeper knowledge of the system''s data, making it simpler for
    them to recognize urgent circumstances and efficiently monitor channel content.

    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level. The farm owner may simply
    view all the data remotely through their phone thanks to this user-friendly mobile
    application. This strategy is particularly important since watering agricultural
    plants demands close attention. Our Smart Irrigation System seeks to solve this
    by providing an accurate study to guarantee timely and effective plant watering.

    the system''s capabilities, which improve agricultural operations and guarantee
    the health of the farm or field. Download : Download high-res image (468KB) Download

    of observation and testing, it is possible to quantify and demonstrate the decrease
    in water use compared to traditional irrigation techniques. Table 4 may be used
    to show how our intelligent irrigation system, which is based on the IoT and embedded
    technology, lowers the water level: Table 4. Calculated the water usage decrease.1
    System Period Water level (%) Traditional 10 days 100 % Smart Irrigation (IoT)
    10 days 30 % 1 IoT is the acronym of the internet of things. The information gathered
    from the conventional and smart irrigation systems was then compared and examined.
    By subtracting the quantity of water used in a smart irrigation system from the
    amount used in a traditional irrigation system and dividing the result by the
    amount used in a conventional irrigation system, the decrease in water consumption
    can be computed. The water usage of the area''s conventional irrigation system
    should first be monitored and documented. The amount of water utilized during
    a particular time period in this paper''s 10 days was measured using sensors.
    The next step is to install and set up a smart irrigation system based on IoT
    and embedded devices. The system has sensors that can monitor temperature, humidity,
    and other environmental variables including humidity, temperature, moisture, and
    water level. An expected 10-day testing and monitoring period are used to compare
    the smart irrigation system to the conventional irrigation system. The same measurements
    and records are utilized to determine how much water is consumed in a smart irrigation
    system as in a traditional irrigation system. The water level decrease is calculated
    by taking the water level used by the traditional irrigation system (100 %) and
    subtracting the water level used by the smart irrigation system (30 %). The result
    is (100–30)/100, which equals 0.7 or 70 % of the original water level. Reducing
    irrigation water consumption by more than 70 % faces challenges such as potential
    impacts on crops, environmental considerations, climate change adaptation, effective
    soil moisture management, technological limitations, and farmer education. This
    research successfully transforms conventional methodologies by articulating a
    breakthrough in irrigation accuracy and efficiency. It presents a smart irrigation
    system that combines cloud computing, embedded systems, and the IoT. It makes
    use of state-of-the-art sensors, such as DHT22 and water level sensors coupled
    to ESP32, for data transfer to the cloud and real-time monitoring. The accuracy
    and operating efficiency of water-level sensors are enhanced by a new mathematical
    function called linear interpolation. By using 70 % less water, the system that
    has been put in place is in line with environmentally beneficial standards. The
    study explores more general implications for agricultural sustainability and worldwide
    food security, highlighting significant advancements in accuracy and efficacy
    achieved by the suggested smart irrigation system. 4.5. Comparison and discussion

    systems, highlighting key functionalities, devices, Parameters, calibration approaches,
    v-models, and their ability to reduce water consumption. The articles included

    (Pramanik et al., 2022) focuses on an IoT-based water usage monitoring system
    using the Croplytics platform with Arduino Uno, LoRa devices, and a GSM model.
    In comparison, our paper (PS) differs by using the ThingSpeak platform and ESP32
    device to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level. Unlike
    paper (Pramanik et al., 2022), our system incorporates sensor calibration, which
    improves data accuracy. In addition, your paper introduces the V Model software
    and helps to reduce water consumption by 70 %, presenting a more advanced and
    comprehensive approach to water conservation. The authors of this work (Abba et
    al., 2019), present an IoT system using Arduino Uno and ThingSpeak to monitor
    humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. Our paper (PS) goes further by using
    ESP32 to improve data collection, covering additional parameters (water level)
    and incorporating sensor calibration for soil moisture and water level measurements.
    This increases the accuracy and reliability of your system''s data. In addition,
    our integration of V Model software and the successful reduction in water consumption
    underlines the depth of our approach beyond what work (Abba et al., 2019) offers.
    The authors of this study (Munir et al., 2021), focus on a water consumption monitoring
    system based on an Android platform with GSM and Arduino Uno models. In contrast,
    our proposed scheme (PS) uses the ESP32 device via the ThingSpeak platform. Our
    system (PS) measures temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level, providing
    a wider range of data points compared to the study (Munir et al., 2021). The addition
    of sensor calibration and V Model software to our (PS) study improves the accuracy
    and robustness of our solution. On the other hand, the authors of this study (Pasika
    et al., 2020), presented an Arduino Mega-based system using ThingSpeak to monitor
    soil pH, turbidity, temperature, humidity, and water level. Our PS extends its
    capabilities by using the ESP32 to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture,
    and water level. The integration of sensor calibration, Model V software, and
    a 70 % reduction in water consumption in our PS system represent developments
    beyond the scope of this study (Pasika et al., 2020). The authors (García et al.,
    2020), presented a research paper in 2020 related to a study of the latest smart
    irrigation techniques to determine the factors observed in existing systems. This
    paper does not use the realisation of the irrigation system including the integration
    of sensors and embedded systems to drive the irrigation. However, our PS use of
    ESP32, full parameter coverage, sensor calibration, V Model software, and reduced
    water consumption contributes to a more sophisticated and impactful system than
    suggested by the study (García et al., 2020). The authors [29] presented a paper
    focusing on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture monitoring using ATMega328
    and NRF24L01. Our PS features by integrating an ESP32 to monitor temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level via ThingSpeak. The inclusion of sensor
    calibration, Model V software, and a significant reduction in water consumption
    improve the robustness and efficiency of our solution beyond that proposed in
    the study (Tiglao et al., 2020). The studies conducted by the authors (Abba et
    al., 2019, Tiglao et al., 2020), employed the DHT11 device for temperature and
    humidity measurements. However, this sensor exhibits low accuracy when measuring
    temperatures above zero, rendering decimal value transfer unnecessary and impacting
    agricultural productivity. In contrast, our approach involved utilizing the DHT22
    device which offers the capability of measuring temperatures and humidity, with
    a precision of 0.1 units. This kind of sensor enables more precise and trustworthy
    readings, improving data accuracy and encouraging better agricultural results.
    Our intelligent irrigation system is based on the ESP32, known for its outstanding
    features such as low power consumption, ample memory, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and exceptional
    speed. Moreover, ESP32-based boards are cost-effective and offer analog and digital
    inputs and outputs, making them ideal tools for reading numerous analog input
    values in intelligent farming and Smart Irrigation Systems. The estimated total
    cost of the proposed intelligent irrigation system is approximately US $60, making
    it an affordable and cost-effective solution. This low-cost nature of the system
    aligns with our goal of providing a practical and accessible option, particularly
    for low-income farmers, in contrast to the methods described by the authors in
    systems (Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba et al., 2019). In contrast to conventional
    irrigation methods that rely on groundwater drainage and can lead to excessive
    water consumption and crop flooding, our system utilizes innovative technologies
    to provide precise and demand-based soil irrigation. By adapting to the specific
    water needs of the crops, our system has the potential to significantly reduce
    water usage by more than 70 %. This efficient and targeted approach ensures optimal
    resource utilization while promoting sustainable agriculture practices. None of
    the scientific papers referenced in this study have used the V model. In contrast,
    our paper which used the V model software design, presents a methodical and organized
    approach to software development, significantly improving the overall quality
    of our irrigation system. 4.6. Smart irrigation improves food security The use
    of the IoT, cloud computing, and other cutting-edge technologies in Smart Irrigation
    Systems can have a significant impact on food security as seen in the Fig. 16.
    Here are some of the ways this technology enhances food security: (1) Improved
    Crop Yields: By implementing intelligent irrigation systems based on IoT to provide
    crops with the right quantity of water at the right time, crop yields may be boosted.
    This can help ensure a steady supply of food by reducing the likelihood of crop
    failures caused by droughts or other environmental factors. (2) Improved Water
    Efficiency: Smart irrigation systems based on IoT use information from sensors
    and weather stations to choose the best irrigation schedule, reducing water waste
    and maximizing water efficiency. (3) Remote Access and Control: Through a mobile
    application, smart irrigation systems using IoT can be accessed and operated remotely,
    allowing farmers to check on and make adjustments to their irrigation systems
    even when they are not in their fields. Farmers who live in rural places or who
    have access issues owing to physical restrictions may find this to be of particular
    benefit. (4) Making Decisions Based on Data: Intelligent irrigation systems based
    on IoT gather a lot of information on soil moisture, weather, and crop growth.
    This information may be used to make better decisions about crop planning, irrigation
    schedules, and other aspects that impact crop yields. (5) Climate Change Adaptation:
    Smart irrigation systems based on IoT can assist farmers in adapting to the shifting
    weather patterns brought on by climate change. These devices can assist farmers
    in modifying their irrigation schedules and other management measures to take
    into account such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental
    factors by giving real-time data on soil moisture and meteorological conditions.

    on food security. In addition to increasing agricultural yields and water efficiency,
    these technologies also enable remote monitoring and data-driven decision-making,
    all of which may help ensure a more reliable food supply. This essay will examine
    how smart irrigation affects food security and how it may help maintain agriculture.
    The research paper highlighted smart irrigation systems as a groundbreaking approach
    to integrating new technologies like the IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing.
    One notable innovation is the real-time data transmission to the ThingSpeak cloud
    and the visualization of the data through the ThingView app. This implementation
    allows for seamless monitoring and control of the irrigation system. By leveraging
    these technologies, the paper enables farmers and agricultural stakeholders to
    access vital information about soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental
    parameters in real-time. This innovation improves decision-making processes, enhances
    resource management, and promotes sustainable agricultural practices. The utilization

    significant advancement in smart agriculture, providing a user-friendly interface
    for efficient irrigation management. This paper presented a mathematical method
    for sensor calibration that brings innovation to the field by ensuring precise
    and reliable measurements. Additionally, the V model software design offers a
    systematic and structured approach to software development, enhancing the overall
    quality of our irrigation system. The paper focus on examining the impact of smart
    irrigation on food security. Better resource management in smart irrigation systems
    results in more sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly agricultural
    practices, with observable benefits in terms of water conservation, energy efficiency,
    crop yield, cost reduction, and overall agricultural sustainability. The analysis
    and interpretation of data in smart agriculture transforms the raw data of sensors
    into actionable information through many functions such as data cleaning and integration,
    application of advanced analytics, providing visual representations, interpreting
    models and providing real-time recommendations to farmers for informed decision-making
    and optimized farming practices. 5. Conclusion and future work In conclusion,
    the article proposed the concept of a “smart irrigation system using embedded
    Systems, IoT, and cloud computing” as an innovative solution to enhance food security
    and promote sustainable agriculture. By harnessing advanced technologies, this
    system aims to optimize irrigation practices, conserve water resources, and support
    long-term agricultural sustainability. The system makes use of cutting-edge technology
    like cloud computing, embedded system, and the IoT to provide real-time monitoring,
    control, and data analysis of irrigation operations. This system supervised real-time
    monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature,
    and water levels in smart agriculture practices. The system used the ThingSpeak
    cloud to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm owner,
    enhancing their interaction. Furthermore, the ESP32 controller is linked to both
    a watering pump for soil irrigation and a water pump to refill the tank during
    low water levels. The automated control of the two water pumps is based on the
    readings of various environmental factors. Farmers can access comprehensive farm
    data from anywhere in the world as the sensor data is transmitted in real-time
    to both the ThingSpeak cloud and the ThingView application. This capability allows
    for more precise crop irrigation and increased production. Moreover, this will
    also present a mathematical-driven function known as linear interpolation to calibrate
    the water level sensor in percentage. This smart irrigation system was created
    using the V model software development approach. The solution suggested in this
    paper uses 70 % less water for soil irrigation than conventional techniques. In
    addition, this paper addressed the impact of smart irrigation using the latest
    technology on food security and its ability to support sustainable agriculture.
    The implementation of this smart irrigation system has the potential to revolutionize
    the agricultural sector, addressing key challenges and paving the way for a more
    secure and sustainable food production system. The future work of this paper involves
    integrating modern technologies and utilizing an MQTT broker to enhance the Smart
    Irrigation System. By merging multiple nodes, the system can handle increased
    data analysis and control elements for large-scale applications such as smart
    farms spanning thousands of hectares. The MQTT broker can further optimize irrigation
    strategies and resource management. On the other hand, future work of this paper
    will include the integration of the concept of smart agriculture within the framework
    of cyber-physical human systems. Declaration of competing interest The authors

  description: Due to the impact of climate change on agriculture and the emergence
    of water security issues, proper irrigation management has become increasingly
    important to overcome the challenges. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    is being utilized in agriculture for collecting field information and sharing
    it through websites in real time. This study discusses the efforts taken to develop
    an IoT-based sensor station, a user-friendly website, and a smartphone app for
    irrigation management. In addition, the demonstration of the IoT-based sensor
    station and its effectiveness are discussed. Before deploying the sensor station,
    soil moisture sensor calibration was conducted using a laboratory experiment.
    Overall, the calibrated soil moisture sensors met the statistical criteria for
    both sand [root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.01 cm3/cm3, index of agreement (IA)
    = 0.97, and mean bias error (MBE) = 0.01] and loamy sand (RMSE = 0.023 cm3/cm3,
    IA = 0.98, and MBE = −0.02). This article focuses on case studies from corn, blueberry,
    and tomato fields in Michigan, USA. In the corn and blueberry fields, the evaluation
    of irrigation practices of farmer's using an IoT-based sensor technology was considered.
    In the tomato field, a demonstration of automation irrigation was conducted. Overirrigation
    was observed using the IoT-based sensor station in some fields that have sandy
    soil and use a drip irrigation system. In the blueberry demonstration field, the
    total yield per plant (p = 0.025) and 50-berry weights (p = 0.013) were found
    to be higher with the recommended irrigation management than the farmer's existing
    field. In the tomato demonstration field, there were no statistical differences
    in the number of marketable tomatoes (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756)
    between the farmer's existing method and the recommended irrigation strategy.
    However, 30% less water was applied to the recommended irrigation strategy plot.
    Thus, the result showed that the IoT-based sensor irrigation strategy can save
    up to 30% on irrigation while maintaining the same yields and quality of the product.

    East Lansing, MI, United States Due to the impact of climate change on agriculture
    and the emergence of water security issues, proper irrigation management has become
    increasingly important to overcome the challenges. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    technology is being utilized in agriculture for collecting field information and
    sharing it through websites in real time. This study discusses the efforts taken
    to develop an IoT-based sensor station, a user-friendly website, and a smartphone
    app for irrigation management. In addition, the demonstration of the IoT-based
    sensor station and its effectiveness are discussed. Before deploying the sensor
    station, soil moisture sensor calibration was conducted using a laboratory experiment.
    Overall, the calibrated soil moisture sensors met the statistical criteria for
    both sand [root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.01 cm3/cm3, index of agreement (IA)
    = 0.97, and mean bias error (MBE) = 0.01] and loamy sand (RMSE = 0.023 cm3/cm3,
    IA = 0.98, and MBE = −0.02). This article focuses on case studies from corn, blueberry,
    and tomato fields in Michigan, USA. In the corn and blueberry fields, the evaluation
    of irrigation practices of farmer''s using an IoT-based sensor technology was
    considered. In the tomato field, a demonstration of automation irrigation was
    conducted. Overirrigation was observed using the IoT-based sensor station in some
    fields that have sandy soil and use a drip irrigation system. In the blueberry
    demonstration field, the total yield per plant (p = 0.025) and 50-berry weights
    (p = 0.013) were found to be higher with the recommended irrigation management
    than the farmer''s existing field. In the tomato demonstration field, there were
    no statistical differences in the number of marketable tomatoes (p = 0.382) and
    their weights (p = 0.756) between the farmer''s existing method and the recommended
    irrigation strategy. However, 30% less water was applied to the recommended irrigation
    strategy plot. Thus, the result showed that the IoT-based sensor irrigation strategy
    can save up to 30% on irrigation while maintaining the same yields and quality
    of the product. 1 Introduction Irrigation is a crucial practice followed in agriculture
    for centuries and plays a significant role in developing economies worldwide.
    Irrigation is the process of supplying water to the crops using an artificial
    means to provide moisture, which helps in the growth and produces higher yields
    in crops. It is particularly important in regions with low precipitation and limited
    water resources. Irrigation also significantly impacts local rural economies by
    affecting the production of crops, creating jobs, increasing carbon sequestration,
    and boosting economic growth. Climate change poses a threat to agriculture. Erratic
    and unpredictable precipitation patterns, rising global average temperatures,
    and water scarcity can compromise food security (Rosa, 2022). Crop health is affected
    by rainfall trends, such as wetter springs, and drier summers with temperature
    anomalies, such as cold or heat waves (Alam et al., 2021). These flooding and
    drought events, without precision irrigation, can decrease the yield and quality
    of the product. In addition to these precipitation changes, average global temperatures
    are expected to increase by around 2°C each year until the year 2100. Higher temperatures
    lead to alterations in evapotranspiration (ET) and weed growth, affect pollination,
    and decrease photosynthesis rate, source-sink relationship, and crop duration,
    all of which can affect plant health and productivity (Malhi et al., 2021). Precision
    irrigation management practices have the potential to increase water use efficiency
    while minimizing the effects of climate change on farms. Irrigation scheduling
    is a well-established strategy to manage crop water needs throughout the growing
    season. This method involves monitoring the water requirements of crops and determining
    whether the existing soil moisture and any additional water from precipitation
    and irrigation can fulfill them. Irrigation scheduling also considers economic
    and environmental variables. Every day, farmers face the challenge of making decisions
    that balance the cost of applying water (labor and energy) against the goal of
    achieving a high yield, enhanced crop quality, and the efficient use of water
    resources. Several types of irrigation scheduling have been demonstrated in the
    past, including ET-, soil moisture-, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based irrigation
    scheduling (Aguilar et al., 2015; Goap et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Alibabaei
    et al., 2021; Dong, 2023; Kelley et al., 2023). ET-based irrigation scheduling
    is a method of irrigating a crop using daily reference ET, particular crop coefficient
    (Kc) value, and the amount of precipitation. Kc is determined by crop types and
    crop growth stage. This method has been shown to save water by up to 61% compared
    to the conventional irrigation application method (Simić et al., 2023). Soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling utilizes soil moisture sensors to estimate
    soil moisture content in the root zone to ensure optimal moisture levels for crops
    and avoid overirrigation. Typically, soil moisture sensors are installed at multiple
    depths in the root zone to understand the soil moisture levels at different depths
    comprehensively. The changes in soil moisture at different depths help to estimate
    the root growth. Many types of soil moisture sensors are available, including
    tensiometers, capacitance sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, and
    frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors. A tensiometer is a soil water tension
    measuring tool comprised of a porous ceramic cup with a water-filled tube working
    on the capillary action principle, which measures the soil matric potential expressing
    soil water energy. Capacitance sensors measure soil dielectric constants that
    differ for different moisture regimes, which provide real-time data for precise
    irrigation management (Smajstrla and Harrison, 2023). TDR is an approach that
    works on the principles of sending an electromagnetic pulse to the soil, and the
    travel time of the pulse is directly related to the soil moisture content, and
    it provides continuous soil moisture data across different depths, which helps
    in understanding efficient irrigation management (He et al., 2021). In addition
    to these sensors, FDR is another technique based on electromagnetic wave reflections
    that send high-frequency waves to the soil for measuring dielectric properties,
    which determines the soil moisture for precision irrigation management (Choi et
    al., 2016). Previously, this soil moisture sensor-based irrigation scheduling
    helped to save water by up to 60% compared to conventional irrigation methods
    (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005; Grabow et al., 2013; Millán et al., 2019). A study
    conducted by Boltana et al. (2023) showed that the soil moisture sensor-based
    method saved 18% of irrigation water compared to the ET-based method in tomato
    fields (Boltana et al., 2023). Moreover, the sensor-based irrigation method increased
    water use efficiency in soybean and potato fields by 49% and 16%, respectively
    (Wood et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2023). The AI-based irrigation scheduling analyzes
    multiple input data, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, plant canopy temperature, crop type, crop growth stage, and
    yield data, to develop AI logarithms. Machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement
    learning techniques are typically used for developing algorithms. These algorithms
    provide predictive analytics about optimum irrigation volume, time and frequency
    of irrigation, and yield data. These data can be used for the long-term planning
    of water usage based on weather forecasts and provide predictive measures for
    proactive interventions. This AI-based irrigation scheduling has been shown to
    improve the efficiency of water use for irrigation by up to 50% (Mohammad et al.,
    2013; Zia et al., 2021) and save the usage of water by 59% (Jamroen et al., 2020)
    compared to the industry standard method. Of those methods discussed, weather-
    and soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling are the most common methods, as
    they are relatively cheap, more practical, and easier to use. While the weather-based
    irrigation scheduling method uses reference ET and Kc to determine when and how
    much to irrigate, the soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling method utilizes
    actual in-field soil moisture data using sensors to estimate the current soil
    water available and determine the irrigation decision. Soil moisture sensors can
    also be used for monitoring the spatial variation of soil moisture within the
    fields, thus allowing precise irrigation management. Recently, soil moisture sensor
    adoption in agriculture in the United States is only 12% (as of 2020) (Kukal et
    al., 2020). To increase this adoption rate, systems should be more cost-effective
    and easier to use (Dong, 2023). Furthermore, farmers need to be more educated
    on how they work to increase the trust in using them. The cost, difficulty to
    use, and trust are the major challenges for adopting the technology by farmers.
    Therefore, affordable and easy-to-use technology is needed to increase the its
    adoption. In addition, the demonstration of the technology in agricultural fields
    to show the potential use in improving the efficiency of irrigation water use
    is needed. In this study, we propose to develop an affordable and easy-to-use
    sensor monitoring system for farmers to improve irrigation management. We implement
    a low-cost sensor monitoring system (LOCOMOS) to measure soil moisture at multiple
    depths and use the data to provide irrigation recommendations. This article focuses
    on case studies using LOCOMOS in corn, blueberry, and tomato fields. 2 Methodology
    LOCOMOS, which was developed by Michigan State University Irrigation Lab, was
    used in this study. LOCOMOS is an IoT-based sensor monitoring system that measures
    in-field soil and environmental conditions. The collected data were sent to the
    IoT cloud web server, from which irrigation recommendations were provided. 2.1
    An IoT-based sensor monitoring system A LOCOMOS system can continuously measure
    soil moisture levels at multiple depths, leaf wetness duration, air temperature,
    relative humidity, and precipitation. The data were then sent to a LOCOMOS IoT
    website (https://www.locomos1.com) to display the recommended irrigation timing
    and amount, the location of the sensor system, the raw sensor data, and the switch
    to turn irrigation on and off. The dashboard on the LOCOMOS IoT website was updated
    every 15 min, allowing the user to observe and make timely farm management decisions.
    An SD card module was utilized for storing and backing up the sensor data locally.
    LOCOMOS is powered by a 12V 7A battery, a 12V solar panel, and a solar battery
    charging controller. Email and Text message alert systems were set up through
    the IoT website. For example, a user could receive an email and text message when
    the soil water available level is at 50% for growing corn. SoilWatch 10, the soil
    moisture sensors, manufactured by Pino-Tech (Stargard, Poland), were utilized
    for measuring soil moisture levels. SoilWatch 10 is a relatively cheaper sensor
    and has provided reliable soil moisture measurement. PHYTOS 31 Leaf Wetness Sensor,
    manufactured by METER Group (Pullmen, WA, USA), was utilized to record the duration
    of leaf wetness. An SHT30 temperature and humidity sensor, manufactured by Sensirion
    (Chicago, IL, USA), was utilized for measuring the air temperature and relative
    humidity. The accuracy tolerance for air temperature and relative humidity were
    ± 0.3°C and ± 3%, respectively. A rain gauge, manufactured by Davis Instruments
    (Hayward, CA, USA), was utilized for measuring the precipitation. The rain gauge
    measured every 0.02 cm increment. Hunter ICV valves with DC latching solenoids
    were connected to the microcontroller to turn the valve on and off. Figure 1 shows
    a block diagram of the LOCOMOS system. figure 1 Figure 1. A block diagram for
    the LOCOMOS system. The LOCOMOS smartphone application (LOCOMOS APP) is an easy-to-use
    app designed for farmers to manage irrigation for their crops. The LOCOMOS APP
    connects to the LOCOMOS IoT server to visualize the sensor data on the app. Each
    user will be verified using a digital ocean server (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows
    the pages of the LOCOMOS APP. To access the app, existing users can log in using
    their registered email ID and password. New users can sign up using their email
    ID and a unique invitation code, which is provided by the server. Once logged
    in, a list of sensor devices will be displayed. Each device contains its GPS coordinates
    and provides real-time available soil water (%) and maximum recommended irrigation
    amount. In addition, the LOCOMOS APP gathers ET and precipitation information
    from the Michigan State University Enviroweather Network. Users can either push
    the “Use My Location” button or select the closest weather station to their field
    to observe the ET and precipitation data. In addition, the map page allows users
    to visualize the precise locations of all deployed sensors on a map. This bird''s-eye
    view offers a comprehensive overview of users'' farmlands, making it easier to
    identify the location of each sensor. figure 2 Figure 2. An overview of the LOCOMOS
    application. figure 3 Figure 3. LOCOMOS-APP pages; (A) LOCOMOS login page, (B)
    Account setup, (C) Device list, (D) Available soil water and maximum recommended
    irrigation amount, (E) Weather information from MSU Enviroweather, and (F) LOCOMOS
    devices on the map. 2.2 Soil moisture sensor calibration The calibration of soil
    moisture sensors to specific soil types was critical as the accuracy could be
    varied. A laboratory experiment was conducted to calibrate the SoilWatch 10 soil
    moisture sensors and evaluate their performances in two soil types. The soil types,
    including sand and loamy sand, were used in this laboratory experiment. Two 144-L
    size polypropylene containers (80 × 41 × 35 cm) were used. The volumetric water
    content (VWC) analysis was performed six times using a 61-cm3 size soil ring during
    this laboratory experiment. Detailed information on the procedure of the sensor
    calibration can be found in Smajstrla et al.''s study (Smajstrla and Harrison,
    2023). 2.3 Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation model The soil
    moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation was estimated using the field
    capacity of soil and current soil moisture content using soil moisture sensors.
    The irrigation recommendation was calculated by finding the difference between
    the field capacity of the soil and the current soil moisture content. This recommendation
    was the maximum amount of irrigation that could be applied without water being
    lost through deep percolation beyond the root zone. The equation of soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation recommendation is shown in Equation (1). An assumption
    was made that the volumetric soil water content for its representative soil layer
    is uniform and has the same moisture level. I R = ( F C L a y e r i -  θ v L a
    y e r i ) * D L a y e r i     ( 1 ) where IR is the maximum irrigation recommendation
    (cm), FCLayeri is the field capacity of the layer i soil depth (cm/cm), DLayeri
    is the representative layer i soil depth (cm), and θvLayeri is the volumetric
    soil water content of the layer i soil depth (cm3/cm3). 2.4 Statistical analysis
    The performance of the soil moisture sensors was evaluated using root mean squared
    error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), and mean bias error (MBE). RMSE measures
    the difference between sensor values and soil sample values and is defined in
    Equation (2). The index of agreement was proposed by Willmott (1981), as defined
    in Equation (3). MBE is defined in Equation (4). R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( M i
    - P i ) 2     ( 2 ) I A = 1 - ∑ i = 1 N ( M i - P i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 N ( | P i - M
    ¯ | + | M i - M ¯ | ) 2     ( 3 ) M B E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( P i − M i )     ( 4
    ) where N is the sample size, M is the measured (soil sampling) value, P is the
    predicted (sensor measurement) value, and is the average measured value. The units
    for RMSE and MBE are VWC (cm3/cm3), and IA is dimensionless. A range of IA lies
    between 0 and 1, and a value of 0 indicates no agreement between the measured
    and predicted values. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the observed
    and predicted values. The higher value of IA indicates better agreement between
    observed and predicted values. Hignett and Evett (2008) revealed that the sensor
    measurement accuracy for most agricultural applications needs to be <0.02 cm3/cm3.
    Varble and Chávez (2011) and Dong et al. (2020) reported that the criteria for
    MBE and RMSE were ±0.02 cm3/cm3 and <0.035 cm3/cm3, respectively. Therefore, this
    study evaluated the sensor performance using the following criteria: MBE ± 0.02
    cm3/cm3 and RMSE < 0.035 cm3/cm3. 2.5 LOCOMOS field demonstration—Irrigation practice
    evaluation Once the sensors were calibrated and evaluated, LOCOMOS was deployed
    in irrigated fields in Michigan farmlands to evaluate the existing farmer''s irrigation
    practices. Irrigated corn and blueberry fields were evaluated. The demonstration
    irrigated corn field was located in Manchester, Michigan, USA. A commercial corn
    was cultivated in this field and was irrigated with 20–28 cm of water and 224
    kg/ha of nitrogen was applied. The commercial corn fields were irrigated using
    a center pivot irrigation system. The second demonstration field was located in
    West Olive, Michigan, USA. The field size was approximately 20 acres, and blueberries
    were cultivated in it. These blueberry fields were irrigated using a surface double-drip
    line system. Soil samples were collected to test the soil texture. The physical
    properties of the soils at different depths are shown in Table 1. The soils in
    these fields were mostly sandy soil, such as loamy sand and sandy loam, which
    were the common soil types in irrigated fields in Michigan. Figure 4 shows installed
    LOCOMOS in the irrigated corn and blueberry fields in Michigan, USA. Corn roots
    typically grow up to 90 cm in this demonstration field. Thus, the soil moisture
    sensors were installed at 15, 60, and 90 cm in the irrigated corn field. In the
    irrigated blueberry field, the sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm.
    All data loggers were programmed to record soil moisture measurements every 30
    min. The soil samples were collected three times during this monitoring period.
    These samples were analyzed for texture and volumetric water content. The VWC
    from the soil samples was utilized for testing the accuracy of the sensors. table

    4 Figure 4. LOCOMOS stations installed in an irrigated corn field in Manchester,
    MI, USA (left) and an irrigated blueberry field in West Olive, MI, USA (right).
    2.6 LOCOMOS field demonstration—automation irrigation Automation irrigation using
    LOCOMOS was demonstrated in a tomato field in Hart, Michigan, USA. The 9V DC solenoid
    valves with Hunter''s ICV valves were utilized to control irrigation. Fresh tomatoes
    were cultivated in this field, and plastic mulch was used to maintain the soil
    moisture and keep the weeds out. Figure 5 shows the experimental setup for this
    tomato field. This tomato field is irrigated with a surface single drip line system.
    Two irrigation strategies, namely, the farmer''s existing irrigation management
    and automation irrigation trigger, were evaluated. The farmer''s existing irrigation
    management included 1 h of irrigation per day in June and twice in 1 h of irrigation
    per day in July and August. The automation irrigation trigger method was based
    on the soil moisture sensor data and used Equation (1). Four replications with
    randomized plot designs were utilized for the comparison. The team has collected
    the number of marketable tomatoes and their weights to compare the effectiveness
    of the treatments. Eight plants per replication were considered. Statistic software
    R v4.3.1 was utilized for running a one-way ANOVA. figure 5 Figure 5. Automation
    irrigation demonstration in Hart, MI, USA. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Soil moisture
    sensor calibration The calibration of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensor was
    conducted for sand and loamy sand. Soil temperature during this laboratory experiment
    was kept constant at 22 ± 1°C. The soil moisture sensors were powered at 3.3 V,
    and analog raw counts were used for the calibration. Figure 6 shows the comparison
    of measured VWC and raw count. Based on the curve fitting, Equation (5) was developed.
    The calibration of SoilWatch 10 was based on a wide range of VWC from 0.04 to
    0.4 cm3/cm3. The calibration of the sensor provided confidence in using it for
    field demonstration. VWC  = 2 E - 13 ( R C ) 3 - 4 E - 9 ( R C ) 2 + 4 E - 5 (
    R C ) - 0 . 0677     ( 5 ) where VWC is the volumetric water content (cm3/cm3)
    and RC is the analog raw counts that outputs from the sensor. figure 6 Figure
    6. The calibration curve for SoilWatch 10. 3.2 The performance evaluation of the
    soil moisture sensor The performance of the soil moisture sensor in the sand and
    loamy sand was evaluated. Figures 7, 8 show the comparison of sensors with measured
    VWC using a gravimetric method for sand and loamy sand, respectively. Table 2
    shows the result of the statistical analysis. The MBE values for the soil moisture
    sensor showed that this sensor overestimated VWC by an average of 0.01 cm3/cm3
    in the sand and underestimated it by an average of 0.02 cm3/cm3 in the loamy sand.
    The performance of the soil moisture sensor for sand and loamy sand satisfied
    both MBE and RMSE criteria. The MBE values of the calibrated SoilWatch 10 were
    similar to Campbell Scientific''s CS 616 TDR sensors. The MBE of CS 616 for sand
    and loamy sand were 0.01 and 0.03 cm3/cm3, respectively (Dong et al., 2020). The
    calibrated SoilWatch 10 provided reliable performance in measuring moisture content
    in sand and loamy sand. This confirmed the satisfaction of the calibration process.

    for sand. figure 8 Figure 8. A comparison of the SoilWatch 10 with the soil sampling
    method for loamy sand. table 2 Table 2. A statistical analysis to compare measured
    values to sensor values. 3.3 Demonstration in an irrigated corn field Figure 9
    shows the collected soil moisture sensor data, precipitation, and irrigation.
    Appropriate irrigation should maintain the soil moisture level in the root zone
    at an optimal level and ensure the water does not flow below the root zone to
    save freshwater and energy, reducing nutrient leaching and maximizing return on
    investment. The corn roots in this demonstration field grew up to 90 cm; thus,
    the goal of irrigation management was to moisten only the top 90 cm of soil. During
    the growing season, five events affected increasing soil moisture levels at a
    depth of 90 cm, which means that the water has reached and passed through the
    90 cm depth. In events #1, #3, and #5, soil moisture at a depth of 90 cm increased
    due to continuous and heavy rainfalls. In events #2 and #3, the soil moisture
    level at 90 cm depth was increased due to the combination of rainfall and irrigation.
    The corn farmer in Michigan typically applied irrigation each time between 2.50–3.20
    cm. When heavy rainfall is forecasted, the farmer could reduce the irrigation
    application volume to capture the rainfall within the root zone and minimize the
    potential leaching of water and nutrients below the root zone. In addition, the
    installation of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensors within the root zone and
    right below the root zone helps to evaluate whether the farmer is applying irrigation
    adequately or excessively. These sensor data are helpful in making better-informed
    decisions on when and how much to irrigate. figure 9 Figure 9. The volumetric
    water content at 15, 45, and 90 cm soil depths at an irrigated corn demonstration
    field. 3.4 Demonstration in an irrigated blueberry field In the irrigated blueberry
    field, soil moisture sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm depths. The
    flow rate of the drip emitter was 41 cm/h and was applied for 60 min during each
    application. During this monitoring period, there were no rainfalls. Figure 10
    shows the soil moisture changes from the farmer''s irrigation management practice.
    Proper irrigation for blueberries on this farm should ensure that water does not
    flow below the root zone, which is the top 45 cm of soil depth. Figure 10 indicates
    that the farmer''s existing irrigation management practice provided an adequate
    amount of water to the blueberry root system. However, the overirrigation events
    were observed because of the spike in the soil moisture sensor at both 45 and
    60 cm depths. Thus, it was recommended to reduce the irrigation time from 60 min
    to 40 min. The farmer tested his part of the field to demonstrate the reduced
    and recommended irrigation management practice. Figure 11 shows the soil moisture
    monitoring at the reduced and recommended irrigation plots. The reduced irrigation
    increased the soil moisture levels of the depth up to 30 cm, which is the effective
    water uptake root zone for blueberries grown in sandy soil. Thus, the reduced
    and recommended amount was adequate; however, when the blueberry was at the significant
    growth stage (at first blue fruit) and higher ET, more frequent (three times a
    day) irrigation was suggested, if needed. The soil type in this blueberry field
    is loamy sand. A smaller amount and more frequent application might be needed
    for the fields that have sandy soil. For finer texture soils, irrigating once
    a day with large volume application might be adequate as they have a large water
    holding capacity. figure 10 Figure 10. Soil moisture monitoring at the existing
    blueberry farmer''s irrigation practice at the blue fruit stage. figure 11 Figure
    11. Soil moisture monitoring of adjusted irrigation practice at the blue fruit
    stage. The total yield/plant and 50-berry weights were collected from this demonstration
    field for both the farmer''s existing irrigation method and the reduced/recommended
    irrigation management. The yield per plant for the farmer''s irrigation method
    and the recommended irrigation management were 552 and 722 g, respectively. There
    were statistical differences between the treatments (p = 0.025). 50-berry weights
    for the farmer''s irrigation method and the recommended irrigation management
    were 87.7 and 93.7 g, respectively. There were statistical differences between
    the treatments (p = 0.013). A potential cause of higher yield in the recommended
    irrigation management could be due to proper irrigation application that reduced
    nutrient leaching below the root zone in the sandy soil. An IoT-based irrigation
    management can help save water while maintaining the same blueberry quality and
    yields as the farmer''s typical irrigation management. 3.5 Irrigation automation
    in a tomato field Figure 12 shows the number of tomatoes that are marketable and
    their total weight from each treatment. The figure shows that there were no statistical
    differences among the treatments in the numbers of marketable tomatoes from the
    2022 growing season (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756). Thus, the production
    and quality of tomatoes were similar from all treatments, but the amount of applied
    irrigation was different. The sensor-based irrigation strategy applied a 30% lower
    amount than the farmer''s irrigation scheduling method, which indicates that the
    farmer could improve their irrigation water use efficiency using the sensor technology.
    An IoT-based automation irrigation management using a soil moisture sensor''s
    recommendation can help to save water by 30% while maintaining the same marketable
    yields and quality of tomatoes as the farmer''s typical irrigation management.
    In addition to conserving water, saving energy by pumping less water reduces farm
    energy costs. Moreover, low energy usage contributes to reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions from agriculture. The primary benefit of an automatic irrigation system
    is that it can save farmers'' time and labor costs in operating the irrigation
    system. figure 12 Figure 12. The total number of marketable tomatoes (A) and the
    total weight of marketable tomatoes from each replication (B). T1 is the farmer''s
    typical irrigation management. T2 is an IoT soil moisture sensor-based irrigation
    recommendation. 4 Conclusion Based on the field demonstration, the IoT-based sensor
    technology has proven to improve irrigation water use efficiency by evaluating
    the farmer''s existing irrigation practices and providing recommendations if needed.
    Providing real-time in-field soil moisture sensor data is helpful in making day-to-day
    irrigation management decisions, especially under unpredictable precipitation
    patterns. Minimizing overirrigation can reduce the risk of nutrients leaching
    below the root zone, ultimately protecting groundwater quality. In future studies,
    more on-farm demonstrations are needed to increase technology adoption. In addition,
    a continuation of extension outreach activities to promote making irrigation management
    decisions based on scientific data is needed. Besides irrigation management, this
    IoT sensor technology can be utilized to help other management practices such
    as nutrient, pesticide, insecticide, frost protection, and plant health monitoring
    (heat and water stress). Therefore, continued efforts to explore the application
    of IoT-based sensor technology in agriculture to combat the effect of climate
    change are needed. LOCOMOS utilizes cellular networks to communicate; however,
    cellular reception may be poor in some rural areas. Other communication network
    systems, such as radio, NB-IoT, and Sigfox, should be explored to overcome the
    signal issues. Moreover, the effectiveness of IoT-based technology should also
    be evaluated in other crop types. The usability of the LOCOMOS technology, including
    the installation technique, software interface, data accessibility, and alert
    systems, needs to be improved to make the technology easy to adopt for farmers.
    Additionally, other potential applications of the LOCOMOS platform, such as wind
    speed for spray drift reduction, soil moisture sensors for irrigation management,
    leaf surface temperature measurement for plant heat stress, and carbon dioxide
    measurement for greenhouse gas emission, should be considered in the future. Concerns
    about agricultural water use have been and will continue to grow due to the effect
    of climate change on agriculture. Because water is a limited resource, technologies
    that improve irrigation water use efficiency will play a significant role in increasing
    agricultural water sustainability. Data availability statement The datasets presented

  description: The irrigation sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) confronts
    a range of obstacles, such as scarce water resources, the elevated salinity and
    alkalinity of irrigation water, inefficient irrigation practices, and inter-sectoral
    competition for water resources. These challenges have led to diminishing agricultural
    yields and abandonment of arable lands. Internet of Things (IoT)-based irrigation
    systems present a promising remedy for these issues. By curbing water wastage
    and ensuring precise water delivery to crops, IoT-based irrigation systems offer
    a viable solution to the challenges entrenched in traditional irrigation methodologies
    in KSA. However, the widespread implementation of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation
    System (I-SIMS) poses a multifaceted and intricate challenge in KSA. This study
    is focused on the identification of the factors and challenges through a systematic
    review and ranking of the challenges/factors that exert a significant influence
    on the adoption of I-SIMS. Ranking aids in determining the importance of various
    alternatives. It enables locating the best options that support the required objectives
    in complex decision situations. The study employs both Grey Relational Analysis
    (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methodologies to prioritize these
    factors. The study’s conclusive findings indicate that among the challenges, technical
    expertise and security measures emerge as the foremost concerns that demand attention.

    predominantly arid country with no permanent bodies of water and has the third-highest
    per capita intake of fresh water (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). The widespread agricultural
    programs Reilly et al. (2023) and freshwater have exhausted non-renewable groundwater
    and degraded the quality of water. There is a significant amount of waste in both
    the urban and agricultural sectors. In addition to this, due to limited rainfall,
    major groundwater aquifers in Saudi Arabia have been depleted. Although the total
    amount of freshwater produced in Saudi Arabia increased from 17.5 million cubic
    meters in 2010 to approximately 24 million cubic meters in 2016, the percentages
    of water produced from different sources remained relatively constant, as shown
    in Supplementary Figure 1. KSA figures as one of the most water-scarce countries
    around the globe. With a hot and arid climate, limited rainfall, and a rapidly
    growing population and economy, the limited availability of water resources, the
    demand for water has far exceeded the available resources. One of the major challenges
    that KSA faces is irrigation, due to its limited water resources and inefficient
    irrigation techniques, which is critical for sustainable agriculture and food
    production (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). These challenges have been discussed in several
    recent studies (Ghanim, 2019; Shankar, 2019), highlighting the need for innovative
    solutions to address water scarcity and promote sustainable agriculture. The traditional
    flood irrigation method, which is still widely used in KSA, is highly inefficient
    and wasteful, leading to water loss through evaporation and runoff (Dinar and
    Donoso, 2020). The demand for irrigation water Singh et al. (2023) has increased
    over the years due to population growth (Rambo et al., 2017), expansion of agricultural
    activities, and increasing urbanization. Groundwater reserves, which are the primary
    irrigation water source, are rapidly depleting also due to over-extraction and
    inefficient use (Chowdhury and Al-Zahrani, 2013). The consequences of these challenges
    are evident in the form of reduced crop yields and the abandonment of agricultural
    lands. The salinity and alkalinity of irrigation water further aggravate the situation,
    negatively impacting crop growth and quality, while also contributing to soil
    salinization and degradation. Outdated irrigation practices, including the lack
    of modern technologies like drip irrigation, add to the inefficiency of water
    usage. With the country’s population and economy expanding, the competition for
    water resources among the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors is intensifying,
    necessitating a well coordinated method to water management. The government has
    thus implemented various policies aimed at enhancing water resource management,
    such as promoting the utilization of treated wastewater for irrigation (Dinar
    and Donoso, 2020). However, the high upfront cost and lack of technical expertise
    limit the adoption of modern irrigation techniques like drip irrigation. Furthermore,
    the swift urbanization and industrialization in KSA are exacerbating the scarcity
    of water resources, leading to heightened competition among various sectors. To
    address these challenges, efforts have been made to develop a comprehensive water
    transmission system. However, the existing backbone is not up-to-date, even degrading
    in many areas. Furthermore, approximately 20% of the water that is distributed
    is unaccounted for (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). The kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces
    multifaceted challenges in the irrigation sector and requires a comprehensive
    approach that addresses water scarcity, salinity, inefficiency, and competition
    between different sectors. Efforts to promote sustainable agriculture, improve
    water use efficiency, and invest in modern irrigation technologies are crucial
    for ensuring the country’s food security and sustainable water management. Automated
    farming systems utilize various types of data, such as soil moisture content,
    temperature, rainfall, and wind speed profiles within indoor covered agriculture
    farm sheds (Ratnakumari and Koteswari, 2020). This data is collected and stored
    in a computer server to provide insights into climate prediction, soil conditions,
    and disturbance analysis. By utilizing these data archives, farmers can effectively
    monitor and analyze the conditions of their crops, which can improve the overall
    efficiency and productivity of their farming operations. Moreover, IoT-based irrigation
    systems (Shankar, 2019) can also mitigate the impact of water salinity and alkalinity
    on crop growth and quality. These systems can measure and control soil salinity
    levels, thereby ensuring crops receive the appropriate nutrients and minerals
    and also help address the competition for water between different sectors in KSA.
    By optimizing water utilization efficiency in agriculture, these systems can free
    up water resources for other sectors, such as urban and industrial use. Consequently,
    IoT-based irrigation systems offer a promising solution to the challenges faced
    by irrigation in KSA. By optimizing water use efficiency, improving crop yields,
    and reducing soil salinization and degradation, these systems can contribute to
    the long-term sustainability of agriculture in the country. However, identifying
    and ranking the challenges for the adoption of I-SIMS is a complex decision problem.
    When resources like time, money, or manpower are scarce, ranking facilitates efficient
    resource allocation. Ranking helps to maximize the effect of your decisions within
    the limits by concentrating resources on the options that received the highest
    rankings. High-ranked options are often those that fit the goals best and are
    more likely to produce successful results, reducing potential hazards. Despite
    its initial adoption several years ago, KSA has yet to fully adopt an IoT technology
    for efficient irrigation management due to numerous factors. To facilitate this
    adoption, a detailed analysis of the challenges shall be conducted. This includes
    identifying and ranking these challenges to determine which ones are most significant.
    Principal approaches such as GRA (Ju-Long, 1982) and AHP (Ayağ and Özdemir, 2007)
    (Rajesh and Ravi, 2015) can be utilized to determine the priority of these challenges.These
    approaches are both useful resources for making decisions and resolving issues
    in a variety of sectors. These approaches are both useful resources for making
    decisions and resolving issues in a variety of sectors. When dealing with systems
    or issues where data is scarce, ambiguous, or imprecise, GRA is highly useful.
    It works well in situations where incomplete data can prevent traditional quantitative
    analysis from producing reliable conclusions. GRA is excellent at contrasting
    numerous options across various aspects. Even in the absence of appropriate data,
    it aids in the discovery of patterns, trends, and correlations between variables.
    By organizing the decision-making process by dividing complex situations into
    a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria, AHP offers a systematic framework for
    decision-making. The advantages of both techniques can be combined to produce
    a more thorough and informed decision-making process with reference to Saudi Arabia.
    The ranking of the alternate factors is significant to achieving the goal of adopting
    I-SIMS by addressing each challenge one by one based on the order of ranking obtained
    using GRA/AHP. The decision problem can be organized using AHP, which can also
    identify the criteria and determine their relative weight. In order to effectively
    handle uncertainty and compare options, GRA can then be used within each criterion.
    This hybrid strategy takes advantage of both GRA’s capacity to handle complicated
    and ambiguous data and AHP’s quantitative prioritization. The goal of using GRA
    and AHP for smart irrigation in Saudi Arabia includes raising agricultural production,
    supporting sustainable agricultural practices, and better managing water resources,
    which shall assure effective water distribution, reduce waste, and encourage water
    conservation. These approaches can aid in selecting the most important challenges
    and enable KSA to move towards a successful and significant implementation of
    an I-SIMS. Smart irrigation systems that are dependent on measurements like evapotranspiration,
    are becoming more popular to enhance efficiency and timeliness compared to conventional
    irrigation methods. There has not been a significant study that addresses the
    KSA decision-problem for smart irrigation. This study will open the door for further,

    ML, ANNs, and DL, especially when fuzzy logic systems are used in irrigation control.
    In this paper, firstly a discussion of related work is done in Section 2. Then
    an overview of the Challenges in IoT implementation in KSA is done in Section
    3, followed by a detailed proposed methodology in Section 4 as well as the algorithms
    including GRA and AHP, followed by the results. In Section 6, the conclusion is
    provided and suggestions for further work. 2 Related work To address these challenges
    of depleted groundwater reserves, which are the primary source of irrigation water
    in KSA and inefficient irrigation techniques, such as flood irrigation, which
    result in significant water loss, recent literature (Habib et al., 2023) has emphasized
    the need for innovative solutions, such as I-SIMS, to improve water use efficiency
    and promote sustainable agriculture. Several studies have highlighted the potential
    benefits of I-SIMS in KSA. For example, the researchers found that the use of
    an IoT-based irrigation system resulted in a significant reduction in water usage
    and improved crop yields in a pilot study done in KSA (Habib et al., 2023). IoT-based
    irrigation systems can help to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and salinity
    in KSA by optimizing irrigation scheduling and reducing water loss. A comprehensive
    approach was urgently needed to achieve sustainable agriculture in KSA, as proposed
    by (Ghanim, 2019). An array of short- and long-term measures were taken in this
    approach. To begin the integrated solution, the effective management of existing
    non-renewable resources was implemented to safeguard the deep aquifer in delicate
    regions. To achieve this, the use of these resources was restricted solely to
    the provision drinking only and agricultural purposes was prohibited. Additionally,
    implementation of advanced water-saving techniques for irrigation, along with
    the cultivation of low-water requirement crops, and the enhancement of agricultural
    and irrigation practices resulted in significant reductions in agricultural water
    consumption. Increasing irrigation efficiency from 47% to 65% could result in
    saving more than 3 billion m3 per year. The second step in the overall solution
    involved creating new water resources using both traditional and non-traditional
    methods. To increase water availability, the utilization of treated wastewater
    was considered. It was important to note that treated wastewater was an essential
    component for irrigation in critical regions of KSA where the deep ground water
    aquifer was alarmingly low due to excessive use. Additionally, the development
    of rain-fed agriculture and more effective water collection practices were highly
    recommended in the country’s southwestern part, specifically on the deserted terraces
    of the AI Sarawat mountains and along the Red Sea coasts. These areas received
    annual runoff water from nearby and moderately damp mountains, which could be
    harnessed through appropriate infrastructure and management techniques. The authors
    in (Shankar, 2019) designed a smart irrigation system powered by Raspberry Pi
    and utilizing IoT technology. The system automatically controlled the water motor
    and tracked plant growth by utilizing a webcam. By connecting to a WI-FI network,
    the live stream of the farm could be accessed through a mobile phone application.
    The authors in (Quasim, 2021) covered a variety of topics including market size,
    notable IoT players, market predictions, academic considerations, overall architecture,
    opportunities, and challenges. The authors noted that the public’s openness to
    adopting new technologies and the desire for a technologically advanced society
    were positive factors for the successful implementation of IoT-based systems in
    Saudi Arabia. The researchers in (Rawal, 2017) presented a system that involved
    the development of an automated irrigation system that ensured the soil’s desired
    moisture content was maintained through automatic watering. The control unit was
    created using a microcontroller (ATMEGA328P) on the Arduino Uno platform. Sensors
    were used to read moisture levels of soil which in turn was used to extrapolate
    the adequate amount of water necessary for irrigation. Furthermore, IoT technology
    was integrated to keep farmers updated on sprinkler status. The sensor data was
    frequently updated on a web page through a GSM-GPRS SIM900A modem, allowing farmers
    to check whether the water sprinklers are ON/OFF in real time. The authors in
    (Campoverde et al., 2021) presented a suggestion for an irrigation system that
    utilized IoT technology. The system utilized sensors and hardware platforms like
    Raspberry PI and Arduino to facilitate irrigation methods on farms. The water
    pumps used for irrigation were controlled by two crucial factors: soil moisture
    and evapotranspiration. To predict the adequate water levels necessary for the
    plants, RL was used in tandem with an MDP. This method helped in the reduction
    of water and energy needs. The proposed system was analyzed and compared to a
    traditional irrigation system that used a soil moisture threshold to make decisions.
    The experiments conducted demonstrated that the proposed method could save both
    water and energy. The study conducted by (Vallejo-Gómez et al., 2023) provided
    a systematic review using a modified version of the PRISMA 2020 approach to identify
    important aspects related to smart technologies used in irrigation systems. The
    review emphasized, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2, that there was a recent
    increase in research on smart technologies for irrigation system control and modelling.
    The authors suggested that this research area had great potential for further
    contributions. The review also found that embedded systems were generally used
    to implement smart irrigation systems. IoT-based systems are frequently used in
    smart irrigation systems due to their simplification in usage and data exchange
    between devices, which makes data collection and monitoring easier. It is important
    to mention that implementing and adopting an I-SIMS requires identifying and ranking
    of the challenges. Numerous studies have explored the use of AHP, GRA. Notably,
    (Kaya and Kahraman, 2010) employed fuzzy VIKOR and AHP methods for identifying
    the optimal energy source and energy manufacturing locations in Istanbul. The
    authors in (Chang, 2015) utilized MCGP to determine the ideal plant types, locations,
    and other criteria for the expansion of the renewable energy industry. The researchers
    in (Kabak and Dağdeviren, 2014) proposed an approach using BOCR and ANP to evaluate
    Turkey’s energy position and rank renewable energy parameters, taking both tangible
    and intangible challenges into account. The authors in (Zografidou et al., 2016)
    applied a 0-1 weighted GP model to develop the best design for a renewable energy
    production network in Greece, incorporating social, environmental, and economic
    criteria. The authors in (Atmaca and Basar, 2012) focused on evaluating the correctness
    of inplace and future power plants in Turkey. 3 Challenges To analyse and identify
    irrigation difficulties/challenges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), a defined
    procedure for gathering and analyzing pertinent literature on the subject was
    followed. The question “What difficulties do irrigation techniques in the Kingdom
    of Saudi Arabia face?” provided insights into the factors that affect irrigation
    in KSA. By using relevant keywords and synonyms connected to irrigation, IoT and
    Saudi Arabia, many relevant publications and ideas were highlighted. use of pertinent
    institutional repositories and academic databases (such as PubMed, Web of Science,
    and Scopus) aided in finding most of the studies done in this domain. Reviewing
    the titles and abstracts of the search results also helped narrow down the choices.
    Many irrelevant papers were eliminated. Finally, a quality assessment verified
    the validity and reliability of the studies that were included. 3.1 Resources
    searched The process of selecting appropriate resources for conducting a Systematic
    Literature Review (SLR) is crucial. In our case, we opted to utilize five widely
    recognized digital libraries that primarily catalog publications in the field
    of computer science. These libraries served as our primary sources for identifying
    all relevant literature pertaining to our research inquiries. 1. Scopus: (www.scopus.com),
    2. (IEEE: ieeexplore.ieee.org), 3.MDPI: (www.mdpi.com), 4.Springer: (www.springer.com),
    5. Google Scholar: (scholar.google.com) and 6. Frontiers Library (https://www.frontiersin.org/).
    3.2 Constructing search string The search query was designed based on three fundamental
    concepts: “KSA,” “water,” and “irrigation” as shown in Table 1 Our search string
    is formed by combining different variations of these three keywords using the
    Boolean operators “AND” and “OR”. table 1 Table 1 Search expressions. 3.3 Article
    selection process In Supplementary Figure 3, the comprehensive procedure for searching
    and identifying pertinent publications is illustrated. Initially, we formulated
    a search string that encompassed keywords pertinent to our Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR). Subsequently, we executed the search query in the leading five digital
    libraries that index computer science literature. Supplementary Figure 3 delineates
    the subsequent stages, including the article selection process, culminating in
    the meticulous review of a selected set of 51 articles. Figure 1 defines the exclusion
    and inclusion criteria as follows. figure 1 Figure 1 Prisma Exclusion/Inclusion
    Criteria. Based on the literature and validation from domain experts, the challenges
    that Saudi Arabia may face in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems include:
    Implementation cost (ICO): The cost of implementing IoT-based irrigation systems
    is relatively high (Antony et al., 2020), which could be a major challenge for
    farmers, especially small-scale farmers. The cost of sensors, communication equipment,
    and other components of IoT-based irrigation systems can be prohibitive for some
    farmers. Constructing an affordable, widely-supported smart agriculture platform
    to improve small-scale farmers’ irrigation efficiency, save water in a variety
    of crops with different water needs at different stages of growth, and yield excellent
    results Saqib et al. (2020). To increase agricultural field output, precision
    agriculture makes use of computers, sensors, artificial intelligence, and automation.
    It keeps an eye on the environment at the same time to encourage the preservation
    of soil, water, and other natural resources, with a focus on agricultural sustainability
    in particular. However, the accompanying expenses of data monitoring and recording
    technology prevent their broad implementation in agriculture Ferrarezi and Peng
    (2021). The Table 2 below gives approximate cost of a simple automated irrigation
    system Ferrarezi and Peng (2021). table 2 Table 2 Cost of a simple automated irrigation
    system. The cost is about $400 with one sensor and $1000 with 4 sensors which
    is not a feasible expense for a low-budget farmer. Internet connectivity (ITC):
    Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure, such as reliable internet connectivity
    and power supply (Nguyen et al., 2021). These systems require a reliable power
    supply and a stable internet connection to transmit data, which could be a challenge
    in remote areas with poor infrastructure (Nguyen et al., 2022). The research study
    done by Jabbari et al. (2023) encompasses a study on farmers and the use of IoT
    for crop monitoring in Saudi Arabia and the study suggested that the farmers in
    Saudi Arabia are highly engaged and interested in using IoT technologies for crop
    monitoring. According to this study, when it came to agricultural experience,
    36.0% of respondents had none at all. 32.8% of those with experience had been
    farming for one to three years, 19.4% for four to five years, 10.0% for six to
    seven years, and 1.8% for more than seven years. These results show a mix of seasoned
    and inexperienced farmers, providing insights into their respective viewpoints
    on the uptake of IoT technology. 28% of people were single, 53.8% were married,
    20.2% were divorced, and 5.2% were widowed. This variation in marital status offers
    a thorough insight into farmers’ various living circumstances and viewpoints about
    the deployment of IoT technologies. Among the farmers polled, 68.8% of the males
    and 31.2% of the females had used IoT technology, indicating a possible gender
    difference in adoption in Saudi Arabia particularly Jizan as shown in Table 3
    and bar chart in Supplementary Figure 4. The study also clarifies the understanding
    of farmers’ attitudes and behaviours when it comes to using IoT technology for
    activities like crop monitoring, health assessment, growth tracking, and yield
    prediction. table 3 Table 3 Demographics. Security measures (SCM): IoT offers
    a dependable means of exchanging data between a vast array of devices, with the
    crucial requirement that this exchange is safeguarded against tampering and other
    malicious attacks (Jyoti Deogirikar, 2017). Security issues in IoT are a major
    concern because IoT devices are in direct communication on the internet and are
    efficient for collecting, processing, and transmitting sensitive data. This data
    can include personal information, financial data, and sensitive business data,
    among other things. Many IoT devices have weak security mechanisms, making them
    vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
    access to systems, and other security incidents (ur Rehman et al., 2022). There
    is currently a lack of standardization in IoT security, which makes it difficult
    to implement consistent and effective security measures across different devices
    and systems. IoT devices and systems may rely on third-party services or software,
    which can introduce additional security risks if these services or software are
    not properly secured. It is important to implement strong security measures throughout
    the entire IoT ecosystem, including device design, data collection and storage,
    data transmission, and user access control. This includes implementing robust
    encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, regularly updating
    and patching IoT devices and systems, and providing clear and transparent information
    about security practices to users. Technical expertise (TEC): One of the significant
    challenges is limited awareness (Madakam et al., 2015) among farmers about the
    benefits and usage of these systems. Farmers may lack the technical knowledge
    required to implement and maintain IoT-based irrigation systems. Farmers need
    to be educated about the potential advantages of IoT-based irrigation systems,
    such as reduced water consumption, increased crop yield, and decreased labour
    costs. Precision agriculture practices, such as using sensors to monitor soil
    moisture and temperature, are not yet widely adopted in Saudi Arabia, which could
    limit the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems. Privacy concerns (PRC): IoT-based
    irrigation systems involve the collection and transmission of sensitive data,
    such as crop yields, soil moisture levels, and weather conditions. Therefore,
    there is a risk of data privacy (Deogirikar and Vidhate, 2016; Teli et al., 2020)
    which could be a significant challenge for farmers. IoT devices can be vulnerable
    to cyber-attacks, which can result in data breaches and expose personal and sensitive
    information to unauthorized parties. IoT devices may share data with third-party
    services or other devices in ways that users may not be aware of or consent to,
    potentially leading to the misuse of their data. IoT devices may have weak security
    or encryption mechanisms, making it easier for attackers to access and steal personal
    data. Many IoT devices and services do not provide clear information about how
    data is collected, processed, and used, or give users control over their data.
    IoT devices can be used to track and monitor individuals without their knowledge
    or consent, potentially infringing on their privacy and civil liberties. To address
    these concerns (ur Rehman et al., 2022), it is important to implement strong privacy
    measures throughout the entire IoT ecosystem, including device design, data collection
    and storage, data sharing, and user consent and control. This includes implementing
    robust encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, providing clear
    and transparent information about data practices, and giving users meaningful
    choices and control over their data. Standard protocols (STP): The IoT landscape
    is rapidly evolving, with new devices and technologies being developed all the
    time. This means that existing protocols may not be able to keep up with the changing
    needs and requirements of IoT (Palattella et al., 2013). Also, the sheer scale
    and complexity of IoT networks require protocols that can support large numbers
    of devices, handle high volumes of data, and operate in different environments
    and contexts. IoT devices and systems have unique requirements that may not be
    fully addressed by existing protocols. For example, some IoT devices have limited
    processing power or memory and may require lightweight protocols that can operate
    efficiently on these devices. Up-to-date business model (UBM): Business models
    should be up-to-date to run on IoT for several reasons. Firstly, IoT is a rapidly
    evolving technology that requires businesses to constantly adapt and update their
    models to remain competitive. Outdated models may not be able to fully utilize
    the capabilities of IoT, resulting in missed opportunities for optimization and
    cost savings (Chan, 2015). Secondly, IoT introduces new possibilities for data
    collection, analysis, and automation. To take advantage of these opportunities,
    businesses must have models that are designed to incorporate and leverage the
    data and insights provided by IoT devices. IoT also presents new security risks
    and challenges that require businesses to have updated models and strategies to
    effectively mitigate and manage these risks. Failure to keep up with these risks
    could result in costly data breaches or other security incidents. Mobile deliverability
    (MOD): Providing mobile services to users in IoT (Kaushal et al., 2022) is important
    because it enables users to access and interact with IoT devices and services
    from anywhere, at any time. By incorporating mobile capabilities into IoT devices
    and services, businesses can enhance the user experience and improve the accessibility
    and usability of their products. Mobile services enable users to access and interact
    with IoT devices and services from their smartphones or tablets, providing a more
    convenient and accessible user experience. It can provide users with real-time
    notifications and alerts related to their IoT devices and services, enabling them
    to stay informed and take prompt action if needed. Users can remotely control
    and monitor their IoT devices and services from anywhere, providing greater flexibility
    and convenience. Mobile services can provide businesses with valuable data on
    user behaviour, preferences, and usage patterns, enabling them to make data-driven
    decisions and improve their products and services over time. The final list of
    identified eight challenges is given in Table 4. table 4 Table 4 Identified challenges.
    It is imperative to note that the relative significance of these challenges may
    vary depending on the specific context and region within Saudi Arabia. In conclusion,
    the challenges facing irrigation in KSA continue to be significant, but recent
    literature suggests that innovative solutions, such as IoT-based irrigation systems,
    could help to enhance the utilization efficiency and promote sustainable agriculture.
    Efforts to increase the implementation and adoption of these technologies are
    crucial for ensuring the country’s food security and sustainable water management.
    4 Proposed methodology Academics and professionals have investigated several factors
    and challenges involved in the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA. This investigation
    requires the collection of expert insights, opinions regarding the significance
    of various challenges, and assessments of the relationship between these challenges,
    which are highly subjective and indeterminate. In order to tackle the uncertainty
    and imprecision inherent in this area, various researchers have employed the GRA
    methodology. For example, (Song et al., 2014) applied GRA within QFD to rank technical
    attributes based on customer expectations. Similarly, citepOmoniwa2014 utilized
    GRA to address multi-criteria selection issues in the field of robotics. The authors
    in (Tosun, 2006) optimized drilling process parameters utilizing GRA, while (Sharma
    et al., 2018) applied GRA to minimize food loss by assessing food safety and security
    risks. In another study, (Tsaur et al., 2017) evaluated the operational performance
    of six TFT and LCD products by analyzing both current and predicted future performances
    with GRA. This study has identified eight challenges that influence the adoption
    of an I-SIMS in KSA. However, the information available about these factors is
    uncertain and incomplete, which makes it challenging to construct a reliable model.
    There is a lack of a well-defined strategy for the adoption process of an I-SIMS
    in KSA, which adds to ambiguity in decision-making. Since implementing SIMS is
    a complex and multifaceted task, the correlation between various influencing challenges
    can be blurry. Systems characterized by imprecise and uncertain information are
    commonly referred to as “grey.” Within the realm of MCDM, especially when decision-making
    involves uncertainty, GRA is a highly effective evaluation methodology (Luthra
    et al., 2018). Thus, GRA can be leveraged to establish a dependable model that
    addresses the uncertainty and unpredictability of complex decision-making processes
    by ranking each challenge and predicting its potential impact on the implementation
    of I-SIMS in KSA. Therefore, the GRA methodology is an appropriate tool to rank
    the challenges. AHP is another commonly used technique in MCDM problem domains.
    Developed by mathematician and operations researcher Thomas Saaty (Saaty, 1989)
    in the 1970s, AHP could be established as a structured methodology for analyzing
    complex decisions, particularly those that involve multiple criteria or alternatives.
    AHP entails breaking down a decision problem into a hierarchy of criteria and
    then assessing each criterion in terms of its relative significance to the overall
    decision. This is accomplished through pairwise comparisons made by experts in
    the field, in which each parameter is compared to every other parameter with respect
    to its relative significance. The comparisons are subsequently converted into
    numerical values, which are employed to calculate weighted scores for each criterion.
    In addition, AHP involves evaluating each alternative in terms of how well it
    satisfies each criterion, with pairwise comparisons made between each alternative
    and every other alternative in terms of their performance on each criterion. The
    comparisons are then translated into numerical values, which are used to calculate
    a score for each alternative. The scores for each alternative are combined with
    the weighted scores for each parameter to produce an overall ranking of the factors/alternatives.
    The decision-maker’s pairwise comparisons are evaluated for consistency using
    the Consistency Ratio (CR) and Consistency Index (CI). The CR is the difference
    between the CI and an average CI that was created at random given a set of consistent
    judgments. To assess if pairwise comparisons are sufficiently consistent, the
    CR value is utilized. A CR value of 0.10 or below is typically regarded as satisfactory
    and denotes reasonable consistency. The CI calculates how far the pairwise comparisons
    differ from a set of judgments that are fully consistent. The AHP has been widely
    used in business, engineering, and other fields to support decision-making in
    a variety of contexts, including project management, supplier selection, and product
    design. In this study both GRA and AHP have been used to rank the alternatives.
    4.1 Grey relational analysis Figure 2 illustrates the process of ranking the challenges
    in the implementation of an I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using GRA. It
    encompasses four main stages: identifying challenges from the literature, collection
    of data using expert opinion, GRA methodology, and ranking of the factors. Step
    1 and Step 2 shown in Figure 2 have already been discussed in the previous section
    in which eight challenges were identified in the current literature. The complete
    algorithm for GRA is given as follows: figure 2 Figure 2 Flowchart grey relational
    analysis. Step 1: Make a decision matrix using expert knowledge. A 6-point scale
    as shown in Table 5, is used in this study to mark the importance of challenges.
    The domain experts are consulted and the data is collected to make the decision
    matrix using Equation 1. table 5 Table 5 6-point scale for decision matrix. Decision
    Matrix (DM)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ d 11 d 21 ⋮ d u1 d 12 d 22 ⋮ d u2 …  …  ⋱ …  d 1v d
    2v ⋮ d uv ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (1) Where dij, 1 ≤ i ≤ u, 1 ≤ j ≤ v represents the significance
    value by an expert (i) for a challenge (j). Step 2: This step involves the normalization
    of the data collected from experts using Equation 2. d '' ij  =  d ij −φ( d ij
    ,1≤i≤u) ϕ( d ij ,1≤i≤u)−φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) (2) Where φ and ϕ represent functions
    that return the minimum and maximum of given values, dij respectively. Step 3:
    Next the normalized values are used to calculate the reference sequence for all
    challenges in the range [0,1]. This is achieved as given in Equation 3. s ij  =
    |ϕ(d '' ij ,where 1≤ i≤ u) − d '' ij | (3) Where ϕ represents a function that
    returns the maximum of given values, d′ij. Step 4: In this step, the GRC matrix
    is calculated as given in Equation 4 in order to find the correlation to the reference
    sequence calculated in the previous step. λ ij  =  φ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) + ρ ∗ ϕ( s
    ij , 1≤i≤u) s ij  + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) (4) Where ρ = 0.5 and is known as the
    Grey Relational Coefficient and φ and ϕ represent functions that return the minimum
    and maximum of given values, sij respectively. Step 5: This step involves the
    calculation of the Degree (D) or Grey Relational Grade Matrix, which is a single-column
    matrix calculated as given in Equation 5. D = 1/n ∑ j=1 n λ ij (5) Finally, the
    challenges are ranked. 4.1.1 Results After an extensive review of the available
    literature, a total of eight challenges (ICO, ITC, SCM, TEC, PRC, STP, UBM, MOD)
    that have a direct impact on the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA were identified.
    These factors were then validated in consultation with domain experts. The experts
    included eight individuals from both academia and industry, and a scale was prepared
    after discussions with them. Data was collected from the experts using a Likert
    scale (Likert, 1985) ranging from 0 to 5 shown in Table 5, where 0 represents
    no influence and 5 represents very high influence. The ratings provided by the
    experts were used to construct a decision matrix, which is presented in Table
    6 and outlines the influencing challenges to the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA.
    table 6 Table 6 Decision matrix. The next step encompasses the normalization of
    data obtained in Table 6. It is done using Equation 2. For example, for (PRC,
    #6), the value 0.2500 is obtained as: d '' ij  =  d ij −φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) ϕ( d ij
    , 1≤i≤u)−φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) = 2−1 5−1 =0.2500 The results of normalization for all
    d '' ij s is shown in Table 7: table 7 Table 7 Normalization. Next, the Reference
    Sequence Generation (RSG) is done using Equation 3. For example, for (SCM, #3),
    the value 0.500 is obtained as: s ij =∣ϕ(d '' ij , where 1≤ i ≤ u)−d '' ij =1−0.500
    =0.5000 The results of RSG for all sij’s is obtained as shown in Table 8. table
    8 Table 8 Reference sequence generation. Now, the Grey relational coefficient
    calculation (GRC) is generated using Equation 4. For example. For (STP, #6), the
    value, 0.400 is obtained as: λ ij  =  φ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u)
    s ij  + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) =  0 .0000+ (0.5 * 1.0000) 0.7500 + (0.5 * 1.0000)
    =  0.5 1.25 =0.4000 The results of GRC for all λij’s is obtained as shown in Table
    9. table 9 Table 9 Grey relational coefficient calculation. Finally, the degree
    is calculated using Equation 5. For example, for ICO, the degree value is calculated
    using Equation 5 as: D = 1/n ∑ j=1 n λ ij =  1 8 (0.4286 + 1.0000 + 1.0000 + 0.4286
    + 1.0000 + 0.6667 + 1.0000 + 1.0000 = 0.8155 The degree for all alternatives and
    the corresponding rankings are obtained as given in Table 10. In the next section,
    AHP methodology is applied to revise, verify and validate the results obtained
    using GRA. table 10 Table 10 Degree and ranking of challenges/factors. 4.2 Analytical
    hierarchical process AHP is another approach that is used in MCDMs. AHP operates
    by incorporating comparisons and a systematic approach to minimize bias in the
    sequence of decisions (Saaty, 1989). The process involves a 9-point scale. Figure
    3 illustrates the process of ranking the challenges in the implementation of an
    I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using AHP. It encompasses four main stages:
    identifying challenges from the literature, creation of a pairwise matrix, normalization
    and calculation of priority weights, ranking of the factors and finally confirming
    the consistency of the pairwise matrix. figure 3 Figure 3 Flowchart analytical
    hierarchical process. The complete AHP algorithm is given as under: Step 1: Identifying
    the most significant challenges or factors that have a direct effect on the adoption
    of an I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Step 2: Creation of an n x n pairwise
    comparison matrix where n depicts the number of challenges identified in step
    1. The pairwise comparison is done according to the significance values and using
    Equation 6 shown in Table 11 as: table 11 Table 11 9-point scale for comparison
    values. Comparison Matrix (CM)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 1 c 21 ⋮ c n1 c 12 1 ⋮ c n2 … …
    ⋱ … c 1n c 2n ⋮ 1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (6) Where,  c ij = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ 1 1 1 −1 3  3 −1
    5  5 −1 7  7 −1 9  9 −1 i is more significant to j i is equally significant as
    j i is less significant to j as defined in Table 11. Step 3: In this step, normalization
    is done by using Equation 7. c '' ij =  c ij  ∑ n i=0 c ij (7) Step 4: In this
    step, the priority/criteria weights and ranking of challenges are calculated using
    Equation 8. w j  =  1  n ∑ j=1 n c '' ij (8) Step 5: Check the consistency of
    the comparison matrix as follows: 1. Calculate weighted sum using Equation 9.
    w s  = CM .  w j (9) 2. Calculate consistency vector using Equation 10. C v  =  w
    s  .  1 w j (10) 3. Calculate consistency index using Equation 11. Consistency
    Index (CI) =  (ξ − n) n − 1 (11) 4. Calculate consistency ratio (CR) using Equation
    12. CI RI (12) Where RI is Random Index given in Table 12 for different values
    of n as follows: table 12 Table 12 Random consistency index. 5. Check if CR <
    0.10, then. The matrix and rankings are consistent, EXIT. Else The comparison
    matrix (CM) should be recalculated. Repeat Step 2. 4.2.1 Results After identifying
    the challenges that impact I-SIMS adoption in KSA, the comparison matrix was generated
    by consulting with domain experts from both industry and academia. Using Table
    11 and Equation 6, the value of significance is inserted for each pair of alternatives,
    and a pairwise comparison matrix is obtained given in Table 13 as follows: table
    13 Table 13 Pairwise comparison matrix. The second step involves the normalization
    of the pairwise comparison matrix values using Equation 7. For example, for (ITC,
    TEC) pair, the value 0.1786 is obtained as: c '' ij =  c ij  ∑ n i=0 c ij =  5.0000
    28.0006 = 0.1786 The results of normalization for all c '' ij .s is obtained as
    shown in Table 14 as shown below: table 14 Table 14 Normalization. Next, the calculation
    of priority weights is done using Equation 8. For example, for STP, the value
    0.1977 is calculated as: w j  =  1  n ∑ j=1 n c '' ij =  1 8 (0.0855 + 0.1293
    + 0.1539 + 0.1786 + 0.2909 + 0.1382 + 0.3871 + 0.2182) = 0.1977 The results of
    priority weights and the corresponding ranks for all wj’s is obtained and shown
    in Table 15. table 15 Table 15 Criteria wights calculation. Now, in order to validate
    the ranking obtained using the pairwise matrix in Table 10, the comparison matrix
    needs to be consistent with the values provided and verified by the domain experts
    because any inconsistency in the values of the pairwise matrix shall mean unreliable
    data which shall point to unreliable ranking. To check consistency, the weighted
    sum is calculated using Equation 9, for example for w5, ws(w5) = ws(0.0825) =
    0.6924. The values for all weighted sums are obtained by the dot product of CM
    with the criteria weights vector, as shown in Table 16. table 16 Table 16 Consistency
    check. Similarly, the consistency vector is obtained by the dot product of weighted
    sum, wswith 1 w j , as shown in Table 16. In the next step, the CI is calculated
    as: CI =  (ξ − n) (n − 1) , where ξ is the average of  C v =  (8.6033 − 8) (8−1)
    = 0.0862 The random index (RI) for the matrix size 8 is given as 1.41 as shown
    in Table 12. Therefore, the CR is obtained as: CR =  CI RI 0.0862 1.41 = 0.0611
    Since CR = 0.0611 is less than 0.10, the comparison matrix is consistent. 5 Discussion
    Both GRA and AHP confirm that the challenges are ranked given in Table 17: table
    17 Table 17 Final ranking. Technical expertise and a skilled workforce (TEC) surfaced
    as the most important challenge in the adoption of an IoT-based irrigation system
    in KSA. There are various reasons that support the obtained result as follows:
    Technical Complexity: Implementing and managing an IoT-based irrigation system
    requires a certain level of technical expertise, including knowledge of sensor
    installation, data collection, data analysis, system configuration, and troubleshooting.
    Farmers and agricultural stakeholders may require specialized skills to operate
    and maintain the IoT devices and systems, which can be a challenge if they lack
    the necessary technical expertise (Catota et al., 2019). Limited Availability
    of Skilled Workforce: In some regions of KSA, there is a limited number of skilled
    workforce, including technicians, engineers, and other professionals with expertise
    in IoT technologies. This can pose challenges in finding qualified personnel to
    design, install, configure, and maintain IoT-based irrigation systems, which may
    result in delays or inefficiencies in the adoption process. Training and Education:
    Providing adequate training and education for farmers and other stakeholders to
    understand and use IoT-based irrigation systems effectively can be challenging.
    The lack of accessible training programs, resources, and educational materials
    for farmers to learn about IoT technology and its application in agriculture can
    be a barrier to adoption. Language and Cultural Barriers: Language and cultural
    barriers can be a challenge in adopting IoT-based irrigation systems in Saudi
    Arabia. The technical documentation, user manuals, and training materials for
    IoT systems may be predominantly available in English or other languages, which
    may pose difficulties for farmers who are not proficient in these languages. Additionally,
    cultural norms and practices related to technology adoption may influence the
    willingness and ability of farmers to adopt and use IoT-based irrigation systems
    (Eysenbach and Jadad, 2001). Upgrading Existing Skills: Adopting IoT-based irrigation
    systems may require farmers and other stakeholders to upgrade their existing technical
    skills and knowledge to adapt to the new technology. This can be a challenge for
    farmers who have been using traditional irrigation methods and may not be familiar
    with IoT concepts, data-driven decision-making, and digital technologies. Cost
    of Hiring Skilled Workforce: Hiring skilled workforce with expertise in IoT technologies
    can be costly, especially for small-scale farmers or those with limited financial
    resources. The cost of hiring or training personnel with the necessary technical
    skills to implement and manage an IoT-based irrigation system can be a challenge,
    making it less financially viable for some farmers. Addressing the challenge of
    technical expertise and skilled workforce in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation
    systems in Saudi Arabia may require providing training and education programs
    tailored to the needs of farmers and stakeholders, promoting the development of
    local talent in IoT technologies, and providing resources and support to upgrade
    existing skills. Collaborations between government, educational institutions,
    and industry stakeholders can play a vital role in addressing this challenge and
    promoting the successful adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems in the agricultural
    sector. Secondly, Security Measures (SCM) are ranked as the second most important
    challenge, which could be attributed to the following reasons: Data Security:
    IoT-based irrigation systems generate and transmit a huge amount of data, including
    sensitive information such as crop data, water usage, and weather conditions.
    Ensuring the security of this data is crucial to protect it from unauthorized
    access, data breaches, or cyber-attacks (Teli and Masoodi, 2023). Breaches in
    data security can result in financial losses, compromise farmers’ privacy, and
    disrupt the normal operation of the irrigation system (Humayun et al., 2021).
    Device Security: IoT devices, including sensors and communication devices used
    in irrigation systems, can be vulnerable to security threats (Masoodi et al.,
    2021). These devices may lack robust security features or may have vulnerabilities
    that could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or control
    over the system. Ensuring the security of these devices is important to prevent
    unauthorized tampering, manipulation, or disruption of the irrigation system.
    Network Security: The communication networks used to transmit data in IoT-based
    irrigation systems, such as wireless (Teli et al., 2022) or cellular networks,
    can be susceptible to security threats. Unauthorized access to the network, interception
    of data, or denial of service attacks can disrupt the communication between devices
    and the central system, affecting the reliability and performance of the irrigation
    system (Abdullah et al., 2019). Physical Security: Protecting the physical infrastructure
    of the IoT-based irrigation system, including sensors, communication devices,
    and control systems, from theft, vandalism, or tampering is crucial. Physical
    security measures, such as securing access points, using tamper-proof devices,
    and implementing surveillance systems, may be necessary to safeguard the system
    from physical security threats. Compliance and Regulations: Adhering to relevant
    regulations and compliance requirements related to data privacy, cybersecurity,
    and other legal aspects can be challenging in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation
    systems. Complying with local regulations, industry standards, and best practices
    for IoT security may require additional resources, expertise, and effort, which
    can pose challenges to adoption. Awareness and Training: Ensuring that farmers
    and agricultural stakeholders know the security risks associated with IoT-based
    irrigation systems and providing them with the necessary training and knowledge
    to mitigate these risks can be challenging. Lack of awareness and understanding
    of security best practices among end-users can result in unintentional security
    lapses or vulnerabilities in the system. Addressing these security challenges
    (Teli et al., 2021) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia requires implementing robust
    security measures, including encryption, authentication, access control, and regular
    security audits, to protect the data, devices, and networks used in IoT-based
    irrigation systems. Providing education, training, and awareness programs to farmers
    and stakeholders about security best practices and compliance requirements can
    also contribute to the secure adoption and implementation of I-SIMS in the agricultural
    sector. Mobile deliverability (MOD) is an important challenge in which the problem
    of providing services to each stakeholder with mobile and remote devices shall
    be made available 100% of the time. Power Supply and Connectivity: IoT-based irrigation
    systems rely on a stable power supply and connectivity to transmit data from sensors
    to a central system. However, in some remote agricultural areas of Saudi Arabia,
    accessing a stable power supply and reliable internet connectivity may be challenging
    and expensive, which can increase the overall mobile deliverability of services
    and maintain an I-SIMS (Adli et al., 2023). Affordability for Farmers: Farmers
    in Saudi Arabia may face financial constraints in adopting IoTbased irrigation
    systems, especially small-scale and subsistence farmers. The initial setup cost,
    ongoing maintenance, and operational expenses may be beyond the budget of many
    farmers, making it difficult for them to adopt and sustain the technology (Mohammed
    et al., 2021) and inhibiting remote service deliverability. Privacy Concerns (PRC)
    is also a top challenge due to the following reasons: Cultural and Religious Considerations:
    Saudi Arabia has a unique cultural and religious context where privacy is highly
    valued, and strict regulations are in place to protect the privacy of individuals
    and organizations. The Islamic principles of privacy and modesty, as well as the
    social norms and customs, can influence the perception of privacy in the adoption
    of IoT-based irrigation systems. There may be concerns about the potential intrusion
    of privacy, particularly if the systems involve monitoring of private spaces,
    such as farms, fields, or agricultural facilities. Data Privacy and Security Concerns:
    IoT-based irrigation systems rely on data collection and transmission through
    various sensors and devices. This data can include sensitive information such
    as crop yield, soil conditions, weather data, and water usage patterns (Habib
    et al., 2023). Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is critical to prevent
    unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of information. There may be concerns
    about the collection, storage, and handling of data by IoT-based irrigation systems,
    particularly if the data is transmitted over the Internet or stored in cloud-based
    systems (Masoodi et al., 2019). Compliance with Data Protection Regulations: Saudi
    Arabia has implemented the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA),
    which governs and regulates data and AI-related activities in the country. Compliance
    with data protection regulations, such as the Saudi Data Protection Law (SDPL),
    is important in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems. This may require
    additional measures to protect the privacy and security of data collected and
    transmitted by these systems, including obtaining proper consent, ensuring data
    is used for the intended purpose, and providing individuals with control over
    their personal information. Ownership and Control of Data: Farmers and other stakeholders
    may have concerns about who owns the data generated by the IoT devices and systems,
    who has access to the data, and how the data is used. Ensuring that farmers have
    control over their data and that it is used in a manner that aligns with their
    privacy preferences and requirements can be a challenge in the adoption process.
    There may be concerns about data being used for commercial purposes or shared
    with third parties without proper consent, which can raise privacy concerns. Lack
    of Awareness and Understanding: Farmers and other stakeholders may have limited
    awareness and understanding of the privacy risks associated with IoT-based irrigation
    systems. They may not be familiar with the types of data that are collected, how
    the data is transmitted, stored, and used, and the potential privacy implications.
    This lack of awareness and understanding can hinder the adoption of IoT-based
    irrigation systems, as farmers may be hesitant to adopt new technologies without
    a clear understanding of the privacy risks and how they can be mitigated. Cybersecurity
    Risks: IoT devices and systems can be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such
    as hacking, malware, and other cyber-attacks. If not properly secured, IoT-based
    irrigation systems can be exposed to potential privacy breaches, leading to data
    leaks or unauthorized access. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, including
    encryption, authentication, and access controls, is crucial to protecting the
    privacy of data collected by IoT-based irrigation systems (Lee, 2020). Addressing
    privacy concerns (Teli et al., 2020) in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems
    in Saudi Arabia may require implementing strong data privacy and security measures,
    ensuring compliance with relevant regulations, raising awareness and providing
    education on privacy risks, establishing clear ownership and control of data,
    and implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential privacy
    breaches. Additionally, involving stakeholders in the design and implementation
    of IoT-based irrigation systems, and fostering trust and transparency in data
    handling practices can also help address privacy concerns and promote the successful
    adoption of these technologies in the agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia. Up-to-date
    business model (UBM), Standard protocols (STP), Internet connectivity (ITC) and
    Implementation cost (ICO) appear in the same order of rankings as provided here.
    Business models are already being updated. Protocols are being devised to work
    in line with the new IoT-based technologies. Internet and implementation cost
    appear at the bottom of the list because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is already
    infrastructure rich and these factors shall pose the least of the challenge in
    the adoption of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. Pertinent to mention that
    Implementing an IoT-based irrigation system requires significant upfront investment
    in hardware, sensors, communication devices, and software infrastructure. The
    cost of setting up the necessary infrastructure, installing sensors, and integrating
    them into existing irrigation systems can be expensive, especially for large agricultural
    areas in Saudi Arabia (Ullah et al., 2021). However, most of these costs have
    already been eliminated by having a current state-of-art infrastructure for both
    the internet as well as up-to-date protocols. Implementation costs may be attributed
    to the following reasons: Technology Investment: Sensors, networking infrastructure,
    data storage systems, and other associated technologies must be purchased and
    installed, which entails a substantial upfront cost when implementing IoT-based
    smart agriculture. Cost of Sensors and Devices: Depending on their kind and sophistication,
    Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can range in price. These sensors are essential
    for keeping an eye on crop health, soil conditions, and other factors. Costs of
    Infrastructure: The entire cost of deployment is increased by the construction
    of the data centres and communication networks required to enable IoT. Training
    and Skill Development: More funding for educational initiatives is needed to train
    farmers and other agricultural workers to operate and maintain IoT systems. Internet
    connectivity is a concern due to these issues: Distant and Rural Regions: Agricultural
    regions that are distant or rural may have trouble getting internet access. IoT
    devices’ ability to work in real-time may be hampered by limited access to high-speed
    internet. Dependability Problems: Even in places where internet access is available,
    there might be stability and dependability problems that prevent smart agricultural
    systems from functioning continuously. Broadband Infrastructure: Broadband infrastructure
    quality and availability are critical. This infrastructure has to be expanded
    and improved to provide the smooth communication that Internet of Things applications
    demand. Data transfer Costs: These may be continuous expenses related to data
    transfer, affecting total operating expenses, contingent on the communication
    technology employed (e.g., cellular networks). It is important to mention that
    perceived advantages only account for a portion of the difference in the desire
    to adopt. Access to information and training, as well as farmers’ perceptions
    of government backing, are factors that show a somewhat positive correlation with
    farmers’ propensity to use IoT technology. Taken as a whole, these factors play
    a significant role in explaining the difference in farmers’ adoption willingness.
    Aligning policies in Saudi Arabia with Vision 2030’s objectives, especially those
    concerning technological innovation and economic diversification, can offer a
    strategic framework for the creation and execution of Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    smart agriculture projects. It’s critical to keep up with Saudi Arabia’s particular
    laws and policies since they could change in the future to facilitate the nation’s
    transition to an agricultural economy. The effective execution of Internet of
    Things-based smart agriculture in Saudi Arabia is reliant on all-encompassing
    rules and regulations, including many crucial aspects. First, standards and interoperability
    are handled employing technical standards, which guarantee that IoT systems and
    devices follow consistent guidelines for easy integration. Simultaneously, data
    standards legislation offers criteria for the gathering, archiving, and dissemination
    of agricultural data, promoting cooperation among relevant parties. It is essential
    to have a strong foundation for data security and privacy. Farmers’ data gathered
    by IoT devices is protected by regulations that place a strong emphasis on permission,
    data ownership, and security against illegal access. Policies also specify necessary
    cybersecurity precautions to strengthen IoT systems’ resistance to future cyberattacks.
    In addition, spectrum allocation and connectivity regulations are important because
    they prevent interference and make effective use of available frequencies to provide
    dependable wireless communication. To provide critical internet connectivity for
    Internet of Things applications in agriculture, regulations further encourage
    the construction and upkeep of broadband infrastructure, especially in rural regions.
    Incentives and subsidies also play a significant role in promoting the uptake
    of IoT-based smart agriculture. Financial assistance from government programs
    helps to mitigate the expenses of initial implementation and promotes wider adoption.
    In a similar vein, policies that encourage agricultural technology research and
    development encourage creativity, which produces more sophisticated and affordable
    Internet of Things solutions. Regulations promoting the use of IoT for effective
    resource management, such as precision agriculture and water conservation, address
    environmental sustainability. National plans’ larger sustainability aims are following
    these policies. The policies that promote multi-stakeholder participation help
    to enhance coordination and collaboration. Governmental organizations, businesses,
    and academic institutions work together to create a supporting ecosystem that
    is necessary for the effective adoption of IoT-based smart agriculture. Furthermore,
    regulations about education and workforce development programs guarantee that
    farmers and other stakeholders have the skills required, hence facilitating the
    efficient application and advantages of IoT technology in agriculture. An all-encompassing
    assessment of these variables is necessary to determine if smart IoT-based irrigation
    is technically feasible in Saudi Arabia. Solutions can be more effectively tailored
    to the unique requirements and circumstances of the Kingdom by working with regional
    agriculture specialists, technology suppliers, and governmental organizations.
    Some important factors must be taken into account before smart IoT-based irrigation
    may be implemented in Saudi Arabia. First and foremost, dependable and extensive
    internet connectivity is essential to the functioning of IoT infrastructure, especially
    in distant agricultural areas where real-time smart irrigation systems are in
    place. For devices to communicate with each other seamlessly, effective data interchange
    and system coordination are dependent on a strong network. Second, positioning
    and compatibility of sensor technology are important considerations. The severe
    weather in Saudi Arabia, which includes scorching temperatures and parched terrain,
    must not be tolerated by sensors. Accurate data gathering on soil moisture, temperature,
    and other pertinent elements is ensured by placing sensors optimally. This is
    essential for precision irrigation control. Thirdly, managing and interpreting
    the massive amounts of data produced by IoT devices depends heavily on data management
    and analytics. Making educated judgments about water use and irrigation plans
    requires effective data management. For better scalability and accessibility,
    the viability of using cloud services for data analysis and storage is also taken
    into account. Also, an assessment is conducted on how well-suited the current
    irrigation infrastructure is to receive automated control systems. This entails
    integrating remotely controllable actuators and valves using real-time data. When
    it comes to energy supply, one must evaluate the dependability and accessibility
    of power sources. In areas with plenty of sunlight, solar-powered solutions may
    be a good option. Adherence to regional laws of data privacy and security requirements
    is crucial for the effective operation of intelligent irrigation systems. To determine
    the economic viability, a thorough cost-benefit analysis is carried out, taking
    into account possible long-term water savings, maintenance costs, and initial
    setup costs. The consideration of the availability of trained staff and training
    programs for farmers and stakeholders highlights the particular abilities needed
    to comprehend and utilize IoT-based systems efficiently. Furthermore, the adoption
    of smart agriculture technology in Saudi Arabia may receive extra help from government
    initiatives and support programs, such as those that are in line with Vision 2030
    aims. To customize solutions to the unique requirements and circumstances of the
    Kingdom, a comprehensive assessment of these aspects must be conducted in cooperation
    with regional specialists and stakeholders. 6 Conclusion The research in this
    work focused on the challenges faced by the KSA in irrigation and how IoT-based
    smart irrigation management systems can help overcome these challenges. The paper
    provided an overview of related work and discussed the challenges in IoT implementation
    in KSA. The proposed methodology that includes GRA and AHP algorithms. In this
    study, both GRA and AHP were implemented to rank the alternatives. GRA is an MCDM
    method that is used to analyze the relationship between a set of input and output
    variables and the results. AHP is a structured technique which involves breaking
    down a decision into a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria, assigning weights
    to each criterion based on its relative importance, and evaluating factors against
    each parameter. Both methods are used in this study to evaluate the adoption challenges
    of smart irrigation management systems in KSA. According to the final results
    of the study, technical expertise (TEC) and security measures (SCM) top the list
    of most significant challenges that need to be addressed in the adoption of smart
    irrigation management systems in KSA followed by Mobile deliverability (MOD),
    Privacy concerns (PRC), an up-to-date business model (UBM), Standard protocols
    (STP), Internet connectivity (ITC) and finally Implementation cost (ICO). The
    scores for each alternative are combined with the weighted scores for each parameter
    to produce an overall ranking of the alternatives using both the GRA and AHP methods.
    This study shall act as a doorway to more and extended studies in this and other
    domains of decision problems with respect to KSA. Suggestions for future research
    include addressing the potential bias inherent in existing methodologies; a fuzzy
    GRA/AHP approach may be used to analyze and rank challenges in future studies.

    in both developed and developing countries. By 2050, the world’s population is
    expected to reach 10 billion, requiring a 70% increase in food production. Sustainable
    agriculture principles must be followed to ensure food security for this growing
    population [ 1, 2]. The objectives of sustainable agriculture are to enhance agricultural
    productivity and reduce the negative effects of outdated farming methods on the
    environment. Developing advanced agricultural practices necessitates substantial
    research and development, especially in the field of irrigation, which accounts
    for 70% of the total freshwater resources. Internet of Things (IoT) and machine
    learning (ML) systems can help monitor, control, and plan irrigation for agricultural
    regions, ensuring efficient use of freshwater resources [ 3, 4]. Smart agriculture
    systems utilize IoT and artificial intelligence to collect and transmit autonomous
    data to data centers. Artificial neural networks and clustering evaluate data
    to make informed decisions, improving the efficiency of agricultural systems [
    5, 6]. A range of IoT and ML irrigation systems have been created with the aim
    of monitoring and controlling irrigation systems. An irrigation system prototype
    has been designed that integrates sensors and an energy module at the top of the
    sprinkler [ 7]. Another example connects a soil moisture sensor to the Internet
    to track soil moisture, while a different irrigation system uses ML to assess
    data on air quality, temperature, and humidity to schedule irrigation [ 8]. The
    management of water is extremely important due to its scarcity. As a substantial
    portion of fresh water is needed for irrigation, this influences agriculture as
    well [ 9]. There are many different types of irrigation methods available, such
    as flood irrigation, trickle irrigation, drip irrigation, and spray irrigation
    [ 10]. Irrigation planning involves monitoring agricultural factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. Open-source platforms, such as Arduino UNO, are used
    in irrigation management systems. Efficient management of water resources is crucial
    for increasing yields and meeting future food demand in areas with limited resources
    [ 11]. We can irrigate more areas with the same amount of water if we use a controlled
    irrigation system. In this study, we develop a method for irrigation prediction
    to effectively control intelligent autonomous irrigation. To estimate the amount
    of irrigation required for each crop, the suggested method uses the IoT. We took
    the following four steps: (1) Install the sensors for water, rain, temperature,
    soil moisture, wind, etc. (2) Connecting the sensor set to a data collection system.
    (3) Using an IoT server to transfer data to an application after storing it on
    a ThingSpeak cloud server. (4) Various algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors
    (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), SVM, and logistic regression (LR),
    are used to analyze the data. This automated irrigation method will be extremely
    useful for large-scale irrigation systems. This will both simplify the labor-intensive
    process of irrigation for plants and improve water management. The concept of
    a related study and the proposed automated irrigation system are presented in
    the article. Section 2 presents a state-of-the-art study on ML, precision irrigation,
    automated irrigation systems, and ML algorithms for irrigation prediction, along
    with comparisons with previous research. Section 3 presents the proposed irrigation
    system design. Section 4 displays the results of the system testing and analysis.
    Future work recommendations are provided in Section 5. The conclusions of the
    suggested study are finally summarized in Section 6. 2. Literature Review This
    section covers the contributions of several researchers in the fields of IoT and
    ML for automated irrigation systems for agriculture. In this research, a ML algorithm-based,
    intelligent, adaptable irrigation technique for smart agriculture is presented.
    For the best possible plant development, it uses sensors for temperature, moisture
    content in the soil, and rainfall. A variety of models, including KNN, LR, neural
    networks, SVM, and NB, are utilized to evaluate the data collected using the node-RED
    platform and MongoDB [ 12]. The IoT and cloud-based architecture are used to analyze
    a smart irrigation system in this article. The device detects the humidity and
    moisture content of the soil; ML methods are used to analyze the data. The system
    uses ML algorithms to forecast the ideal amount of fresh water for crop production,
    which results in significant water savings. The agricultural industry is predicted
    to change due to this technology [ 13]. To solve irrigation-related problems,
    the researcher developed a solution that uses ML and the IoT. Pressure, pH, temperature,
    humidity, and other sensor types are included in the hardware. The pH sensor measures
    the pH of the soil and forecasts water requirements. The aim is to develop automated
    irrigation systems and save water for future usage. Improvements in agricultural
    water efficiency and conservation are the objectives of the initiative [ 14].
    In this, a low-cost and intelligent agricultural irrigation system is presented.
    The constructed prototype uses a hardware sensor and a unit to monitor temperature,
    humidity, and water level. To determine whether to turn on or off the motor, the
    study uses a variety of sensors to collect various readings and values. The IoT-based
    automated system uses applications to establish an independent irrigation system.
    It also sends SMS messages to our mobile devices, providing us with remote updates
    on irrigation field details [ 15]. Research has developed a smart irrigation system
    that estimates the depth of crop water (WUD) for tomato planting based on real-time
    soil moisture data. A central irrigation controller was used to collect the data,
    guaranteeing an accurate irrigation depth at every irrigation event. The experiment
    was carried out in a Northern Chinese greenhouse [ 16]. This research suggests
    that instead of using physical sensors in a smart irrigation system, neural networks
    based on long–short-term memory (LSTM) should be used. The system computes transpiration
    in each field by transmitting temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data via
    physical sensors. LM35 is used for temperature, DHT-22 is used for humidity, and
    a bespoke sensor is used for moisture readings. Real-time data were collected.
    The findings indicate that the neural sensor suggested based on deep learning
    has a high degree of accuracy when predicting real-time data, especially those
    related to wetness, temperature, and humidity. This shows that a neural network
    can improve the performance of physical sensors in agricultural settings, increasing
    the dependability of smart irrigation systems [ 17]. In the research, the researcher
    developed a framework that combines IoT with various metrics and methodologies
    to monitor data related to temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. This approach
    offers farmers the ability to analyze data in real-time, allowing them to monitor
    soil moisture, temperature, and automated irrigation systems more efficiently,
    with reduced use of time and energy, and in decision-making analysis specifically
    designed for farmers [ 18]. A method was developed to increase the efficiency
    of irrigation for cotton crops. Researchers have examined a variety of data sets
    to calculate the exact amount of water required for a particular soil combination.
    A mobile application makes the results of analytical research accessible to farmers
    or other users [ 19]. Table 1 illustrates some more previous research on automated
    irrigation systems for smart agriculture. Table 1  Previous research work and
    future recommendations on automated irrigation system. This article focuses on
    research on an autonomous irrigation management system for agricultural fields.
    The system uses a mobile application for data consultation and analysis in real-time,
    as well as a wireless sensor and actuator network. RF produced the best results
    with an accuracy of 84.6% when ML techniques were employed to estimate the optimal
    timing for water administration. An approach is also included in the system to
    figure out how much water is required for field management. Water management technology
    that is both effective and efficient, as shown by the ability of the system to
    save up to 60% of the water used [ 27]. ML and deep learning technologies can
    be used to improve crop yield and manage irrigation in agriculture. These approaches
    exemplify the fast progress of artificial intelligence in the agricultural industry.
    The concept of smart farming encompasses monitoring all agricultural processes,
    predicting diseases, managing agricultural pests, and automated irrigation [ 28].
    The article presents a machine-learning and IoT-based irrigation system that improves
    efficiency. Sensors on a Raspberry Pi measure soil temperature and moisture content
    using the serial peripheral interface protocol. The NB technique is used to train
    a ML model that regulates the irrigation system with an accuracy of 98.33%. A
    prototype project with a water pump and relay is also built to demonstrate the
    precise operation of the system [ 29]. Table 2 illustrates previous research on
    the automated irrigation system for smart agriculture using ML. Table 2  Previous
    research on supervised machine learning models for automated irrigation system.
    3. Proposed Hybrid Irrigation System One of the essential stages in the production
    of agricultural products is irrigation. Agricultural uses account for around 80%
    of the entire water supply, although the amount of water available varies considerably
    from region to region. The adoption of microirrigation technology takes an hour.
    But farmers still adhere to an old irrigation pattern, which causes a huge loss
    of water. Existing sprinkler systems are not suitable for all crops. The height
    of the sprinkler irrigation is 4 feet, so it cannot irrigate crops greater than
    4 feet. In drip and sprinkler irrigation systems, the pipe structure of the system
    spreads throughout the field, making intercultural operations difficult. Binding
    up the system during harvesting and sawing new crops leads to damage to pipes
    as well as to crops and to a highly labor-consuming process. Damage due to rodents
    is more common in fixed-set irrigation systems. The center pivot irrigation system
    and the linear move irrigation system are constructed of heavy pipes and are complex
    structured. They are not suitable for fields of unusual shapes because of their
    high capital and maintenance requirements. Related research and findings are discussed
    in the literature review, and future work recommendations are shown in Table 1.
    To overcome these problems, we proposed a hybrid irrigation system that would
    be able to automatically irrigate different crops from a remote location. The
    objective of the proposed hybrid irrigation system is to overcome the problems
    of existing systems. The suggested smart irrigation architecture is shown in Figure
    1.    Figure 1  Proposed architecture for smart irrigation. This research has
    developed a smart irrigation system that automatically waters crops without human
    involvement. As a center pivot and linear move irrigation system, it also irrigates
    crops with vertical sprinkles, but in a center pivot and linear move irrigation
    system, farmers need heavy machinery, power supply, or human resources to move
    the system in the field to meet the irrigation requirements. The proposed irrigation
    system is a stable and user-friendly model. It is designed in a T shape, which
    is fixed in the field with some distance, and irrigates the field with sprinklers.
    The system uses moisture sensors to measure the moisture content of the soil in
    fields. When the moisture levels drop below the minimum level, the NodeMCU board
    activates the water pump, providing water to the crop. The water sensor also monitors
    the conditions of the water reservoir, sending signals to the NodeMCU when the
    reservoir is empty. Wind speed sensors measure the wind speed on the farm, while
    rain sensors detect the rain status in the field. The data from soil moisture
    sensors are displayed on an LCD screen. Solenoid valves are embedded to control
    water flow in different farms. If soil moisture drops below the threshold value
    for farm field A, the solenoid valves are activated, while the remaining valves
    remain off. This irrigation system helps farmers irrigate their fields with less
    labor and time. The hybrid irrigation system is built with the ability to automatically
    irrigate crops, considering factors such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture. Taxonomy is used to consider the choice of climatic and soil
    conditions, while our sensor network keeps track of factors, such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. In contrast to the three levels of conventional IoT
    design (application layer, network layer, and perception layer), our proposed
    IoT architecture comprises four layers: application layer, processing layer, transport
    layer, and perception layer. Sensors are included in the physical layer, often
    referred to as the perception layer, to collect data such as soil moisture level,
    air humidity and temperature, rainfall level and wind speed. Using networks like
    Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, and LAN, sensing data that has already been acquired is sent from
    the transport layer to the processing layer. The transport layer sends massive
    amounts of data to the processing layer, which stores, analyzes, and processes
    it. It uses modern tools, such as cloud servers and the IoT. The main goal of
    the application layer is to provide user-specific application services. Our system
    manages the sensors, GSM module, ThingSpeak cloud server, IoT server, Android
    application (Blynk application), and other components. We have been able to prepare
    our system for complete autonomy thanks to these technologies. 3.1. Architecture
    of the Proposed System and Working Principals This research developed a method
    for automatic watering by measuring ground moisture values. This smart irrigation
    system allows farmers to control and adjust irrigation with fewer human resources.
    Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the hybrid irrigation system.    Figure 2  System
    block diagram. The NodeMCU is an open-source platform that utilizes the ESP8266
    to facilitate the connection of devices and enable the transmission of data via
    the Wi-Fi protocol. Different types of sensors are used to control the irrigation
    system and monitor the field. Sensors such as soil moisture sensor, wind sensor,
    water level sensor, rain detection sensor, temperature, and humidity sensor, etc.,
    node MCU 8266 is used in this prototype as main board. A soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure soil moisture content in the field. The required soil moisture
    threshold value is described, and if soil moisture exceeds or decreases from the
    threshold value, the soil moisture sensor will send the current soil moisture
    value to the server through the node MCU. The updated current soil moisture value
    is sent to the application, and the farmer can start irrigation according to the
    minimum water requirements of the crops from a remote location automatically.
    Water sensor is utilized to monitor the water status at the dam. If the water
    dam is empty, then it will send the empty signals to the application, and at the
    same time, a buzzer is used to indicate an empty water dam if someone is around
    the field to shut down the motor manual. A wind speed sensor is used to measure
    the wind speed. Wind speed plays an important role in sprinkler water, so if wind
    speed is high, the farmer can turn off the motor to reduce water waste. Solenoid
    valves control water flow on different farms. If soil moisture decreases below
    the threshold value for a farm field, solenoid valves activate for that farm,
    while the remaining valves remain off for other farms. An LCD screen is used to
    display soil moisture from all fields for quick review of soil moisture at field
    level. This innovative approach benefits farmers who struggle to irrigate crops.
    After the sensors were attached to the board, we started programing the board
    to control the sensors in a way that made it possible for different types of data
    to be collected and transferred in real-time. Then, we utilized the ThingSpeak
    cloud server to ensure data storage, and we used the application to monitor and
    operate the irrigation system. We then aggregated several months of data so that
    we could train it to anticipate when to start or stop pumping and close the valve.
    3.2. System Working Flowchart The flowchart of the proposed system provides the
    basic principles of the system and an overview, as shown in Figure 3.    Figure
    3  Working flowchart system. The working steps are as follows: (1) In Step 2,
    the system analyzes the sensor data. (2) In Step 3, the node MCU esp8266 may be
    used to initialize the system. (3) Step 4: The server/application gets information
    from numerous sensors deployed in the agricultural field, including the soil moisture
    sensor, wind sensor, humidity sensor, rain sensor, and water level sensor. (4)
    In Step 5, the soil moisture sensor continuously measures the soil moisture content.
    If the soil moisture is below the required threshold level, the signals are sent
    to the application and the node MCU. The solenoid valves attached to that soil
    moisture sensor will turn on when the update is transmitted to the node MCU, but
    the solenoid valves connected to other sensors will stay optimal. (5) In Step
    6, the motor that is attached to the relay will be turned on either through the
    application or manually. (6) In Step 7, when the amount of soil moisture reaches
    the required threshold level, the relay will automatically turn the motor off
    and the solenoid valves off. (7) In Step 8, the other sensors continuously read
    the data and transmit it to the server or application. For example, a water level
    sensor monitors the water level in the dam; if the dam is empty, the application
    is updated with an empty status, and the buzzer starts beeping. The wind speed
    sensor and the temperature sensor continuously monitor the wind speed and temperature
    of the field because both factors play an important role in irrigation. High temperatures
    and wind speeds cause water loss during irrigation. By monitoring the field, irrigation
    can be scheduled according to temperature and wind speed. (8) In Step 9, once
    Steps 7 and 8 have been completed, the system will go to Step 2. (9) In Step 10,
    the system reads the data from the field and transmits it to the application.
    This operation will continue until the system’s input power is turned off. 3.3.
    Hybrid Irrigation System Design 3.3.1. Hardware Implementation To develop the
    hybrid irrigation system, few steps are performed: Hybrid irrigation model structure
    is shown in Figure 4.    Figure 4  Hybrid irrigation model structure. (1) The
    material is cut into the desired length dimension of the structure is 1.2 into
    0.17 into 0.4 m. (2) The project structure is designed in upside down U-shape
    structure and T-shape hybrid irrigation system. (3) Eight millimeters water pipe
    is used as a main supply pipe. Six millimeters water pipe is used for subpipeline
    for supply the water to field. (4) T and L shape pipe connectors are used to connect
    the subpipe with main pipes and solenoid valves. 3.3.2. Software Implementation
    As mentioned previously, the NodeMCU requires a supply voltage of 5 V DC to operate
    the circuit components. The DHT 11 sensor data pin is connected to the node MCU
    pin D2 and GND and VCC to (ground, 3.3 V), soil moisture sensor connected to the
    A0 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D4 pin of the node MCU, and GND,
    VCC pin connected with the ground pin, 3.3 V, soil moisture sensor b, connected
    to the A1 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D8 pin of the node MCU,
    and GND, VCC pin connected with the pin ground, 3.3 V. The rain detection sensor
    is linked to the node MCU via pin D5. The water sensor is connected to that digital
    pin of node MCU D6 and the buzzer is connected to the digital pin of node MCU
    D7. If the water level is low, the D7 pin gets a signal and the buzzer will beep
    out. LCD display connected with the digital pins of the Arduino Uno RS = 7, EN = 6,
    D4 = 5, D5 = 4, D6 = 3, D7 = 2. Wind speed sensor connected to the analog pin
    of node MCU A0. To connect the water pump motor and the solenoid valves, we will
    need a relay module. Relay 1 will take the signal input value from soil moisture
    sensor 1 and relay 2 will take the signal from soil moisture sensor2. Relay 1
    is connected to the digital pin of Arduino D8 and relay 2 is connected to the
    digital pin of Arduino Uno D9. Relay 1 will control the two solenoid valves, solenoid
    valve 1A and solenoid valve 1B, and relay will control the two solenoid valves
    called solenoid valves 2A and 2B. The motor is connected to the third relay and
    the relay is connected to the digital pin D1 of the node MCU. Transistors and
    resistors are used to regulate the voltage within a range of 3-5 volts to safeguard
    sensors and equipment from excessive voltage fluctuations. For the operation of
    the system, we used 5 volts of DC power for the node MCU and 2 volts of power
    for the Arduino Uno, along with one USB cable to complete the power supply to
    the Arduino Uno. Twelve volt power supply is connected with the solenoid valves
    and motor and with the relays. To establish the communication between hardware
    and the blink application, we need to establish the communication between the
    hardware and the blink application. We need to set the virtual connection between
    the sensors and the blink application. Data from DHT 11 sensors were sent to the
    blynk server using the virtual connection V0, V1, and V2. The rain sensor connected
    to the virtual pin V6 and the water sensor is connected to the virtual pin V7
    soil moisture one connected to the virtual and pin V8 8 and the soil moisture
    sensor 2 connected to the virtual pin V9. Wind speed sensor pin is connected to
    the virtual pin V4 and V5, and the water pump relay is connected with the virtual
    V3 pin to control the water motor. Sensor’s connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3 is represented in Figure 5. Several tools are included in the software
    design method that are necessary for the system to function properly. A few of
    them are as follows:    Figure 5  Sensors connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3. (1) Firmware developed using C/C++ with the Arduino IDE. (2) The ThingSpeak
    cloud server was used to collect and store data for further analysis. (3) Data
    visualization for field control and monitoring is done using the Blynk application.
    (4) Real-time data are collected and sent to the ThingSpeak cloud server after
    the same code is updated to send data to the Blynk application to control and
    monitor sensor data automatically through the application. (5) To simplify the
    access and control of the system, a Wi-Fi or Internet service provider is used.
    (6) For data analysis, Jupiter Notebook and Anaconda are used. 3.3.3. Hybrid Irrigation
    System Working Application An Android application is being developed for farmers
    to monitor and control the hybrid irrigation system. Input parameters such as
    soil moisture, wind speed, rain status, water, temperature, and humidity are displayed
    in an application. The farmer will be able to monitor and control field conditions
    at any time and from anywhere. With the help of this application, the farmer will
    control the motor switch and irrigate the crop according to the requirements and
    availability of water. The mobile application is shown in Figure 6.    Figure
    6  Blynk smart irrigation application. 4. Machine Learning Analysis Algorithms
    This section presents supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze the performance
    of the automated irrigation system. Supervised learning is a method where models
    are trained on a training data set to produce the desired output. This process
    involves acquiring knowledge and improving performance over time. The model’s
    precision is evaluated using a loss function, and adjustments are made until the
    error is reduced. This research utilizes a set of supervised machine learning
    algorithms such as LR, KNN, support vector machine (SVM), NB, and RF classifiers.
    Table 2 presents the results of previous research studies that utilized supervised
    machine learning techniques to analyze a smart irrigation system. The research
    presents a machine learning-based irrigation strategy for smart agriculture using
    sensors like soil humidity, temperature, and rain. The node-RED platform and MongoDB
    collect data, with KNN achieving 98.3% accuracy. A web application visualizes
    and supervises the environment [ 12]. This study examines a smart irrigation system
    that utilizes the IoT and a cloud-based architecture. This technology is developed
    to monitor the moisture and humidity content of the soil and then use several
    machine learning algorithms for analyzing the data in the cloud. Farmers receive
    accurate information on water content requirements. Intelligent irrigation may
    help farmers use less water [ 13]. In this research, we proposed a new irrigation
    model (T-shaped sprinkler irrigation). Different types of sensors are used to
    collect data from the field, like soil moisture sensors, wind sensors, temperature
    sensors, rain sensors, water level sensors, etc. All sensors are connected to
    the node MCU and UNO to control and collect data from the field. Data collected
    from the agriculture field is stored on the ThingsSpeak cloud server. A total
    of 3,000 lines of data are collected for analysis using machine learning algorithms
    to calculate the accuracy of the working automated irrigation system. From the
    collected data, 80% was used for training purposes, and 20% was used for testing
    the algorithms. After collecting the data for analysis, we developed an application
    for monitoring and controlling the irrigation. The algorithms used for the classification
    of automated hybrid irrigation systems are described below. 4.1. Support Vector
    Machine SVM is a machine learning technique that is used for classification and
    regression tasks and is specifically designed to identify objects within given
    data sets. This method effectively divides n-dimensional spaces into various classes,
    making data entry efficient. The research used the kernel trick mechanism of SVMs
    for classification purposes. This technique includes the transformation of 2D
    nonlinear separable data sets into higher dimensions, such as three, four, or
    10 dimensions [ 30]: 4.2. Naïve Bayes Thomas Bayes (1702–1761) developed the Naïve
    Bayesian approach to probabilistic machine learning, which is based on the Bayes
    theorem. The likelihood of A occurring given that B has already happened can be
    used to describe this theorem. Considering X = (x1,…, xn) is the features, and
    Y is the class variable, in this sentence. The NB algorithm is unique in that
    it assumes that each characteristic is independent of the others and that modifying
    one feature will not affect any other. Despite appearing straightforward, NB has
    turned out to be a useful classification system: 4.3. Logistic Regression LR is
    a supervised machine-learning method used for classification tasks. This method
    is used to determine the probability of the dependent variable. The target variable
    has a binary nature, indicating that it may only assume one of two potential classes:
    success (represented by 1 or yes) or failure (represented by 0 or no). The classification
    of this may be categorized into three main types: binary or binomial, multinomial,
    and ordinal. The equation for linear regression may be expressed as the equation
    of a straight line: 4.4. K-Nearest Neighbors The KNN method is a supervised learning
    approach often used in machine learning. The algorithm operates on the assumption
    that there exists a degree of similarity between the newly acquired data and the
    data that are already accessible. When assigning the newly acquired data to the
    category that exhibits the highest degree of similarity with the existing categories,
    the KNN algorithm uses the Manhattan equation to calculate the distance within
    this framework. The formula for the Manhattan distance is shown in Equation (4)
    [ 12]: 4.5. Random Forest Ensemble learning is a powerful teaching strategy. For
    categorization purposes, RF is commonly used. Each decision tree’s planned output
    is represented by the forest’s output, and the categorization is based on the
    information gathered from the many decision trees created during training. Random
    forest decreases variance in the final model, improves performance, and controls
    overfitting by building decision trees using random samples of the training data
    [ 8]. 4.6. Collecting and Storing Data Automated modeling and continuous collection
    of real-time measurements of environmental factors, such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature, humidity, and pump activity, were taken into consideration when developing
    the hybrid smart irrigation system based on the IoT. To perform the analysis,
    the ThingSpeak cloud server is used to collect data from all sensors. We began
    implementing these devices in various environments with various soil conditions
    in the mass collection process using IoT technologies, which are made up of many
    autonomous devices in the form of sensors capable of self-organization and working
    to collect information. It was built to distribute the data using an algorithm
    to provide an essential interface during the project. This was a practically complete
    implementation of our data set. Data collected from different sensors with different
    ranges are discussed below. (1) Soil moisture data: As shown in Table 3, these
    data are generated by an analog sensor over a range of values between 0 and 1,023.
    We can see that the smallest value is 314.51 and the maximum value is 984.82,
    meaning that the average value is 654.5. (2) Temperature data: A DHT11 temperature
    sensor was used to collect air temperature data from the environment in the form
    of Celsius. We can observe that the average temperature throughout the collected
    months was 26.24, exceeding both its upper and lower limitations. The minimum
    value during this time was 18.00, and the highest temperature during this time
    was 38.99. (3) Data on air humidity: We were able to acquire data on air humidity
    using the same temperature sensor that helped with collecting air temperature
    values, and the following is an analysis of those data. The average was 66.4%
    while collecting the massive amount of data, with the lowest value being 38% and
    the highest value being 81.26%. Table 3  Analysis data set. The study suggests
    an automated design based on the peer-to-peer concept, using data that can be
    classified with values that vary from 0 to 1. The final design was implemented
    to show its feasibility and prevent major problems. The data collected from all
    sensors are shown in Table 3. 4.7. Results and Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms
    Any machine learning method, including KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, which are all
    classification dilemma handling algorithms, can forecast the degree of irrigation
    demand. In this paper, all the abovementioned techniques are used to analyze the
    collected data. For experimental analysis, a collection of 3,000 data recordings
    was collected. These factors include soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the water pump for irrigation decision-making. Five machine learning algorithms,
    KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, were utilized in an experimental investigation. Two
    different colors are used to represent the graph. Red colors are used to represent
    0, and blue colors represent 1. To achieve better accuracy and application modeling,
    the data available on soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and motor working
    status are divided into two sets: the training data set and the testing data set.
    The training set contains 80% of the data, and 20% is used for testing and validation.
    The training data set is used to train the different machine learning algorithms,
    and the testing data set is used to test the models, which will help to find the
    accuracy of their workings and the best machine learning algorithm. Figure 7 represents
    the training data and test data in a graphical view.    Figure 7  Graph displays
    training and test data. The real-time collected data from field are stored for
    analysis using different machine learning algorithms. The data collection process
    is done on a ThingSpeak cloud server and published on Mendeley Data [ 37]. Table
    3 shows the data for making training predictions, looking at presorted data, and
    showing outcomes. After analyzing all five machine learning algorithms, the results
    from the models used in this study are shown together with their accuracy and
    mean square error (RMSE) in Table 4. The same outcome is shown in Figure 8, as
    in a graph.    Figure 8  The output of our models is shown in a graph. Table 4  Models
    anàlisis result. (1) The output of the KNN model is shown in Line 1, where the
    corresponding red and blue colors of the training and testing sets stand in for
    the pumping points between “0” and “1.” All the data points supplied in red and
    green are shown to be integrated into their surroundings by the model, respectively.
    The model’s rate of accuracy in describing the outcomes is 98.3%. (2) Line 2 displays
    a 99.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square error for the RF model. (3) Line
    3 shows the results of the NB model with a 98.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square
    error. (4) In Line 4, where the SVM model’s results are displayed and as a result,
    the mean square error is 0.66 and the accuracy rate is 99.3%. (5) Finally, a LR
    model with a mean square error that is very nearly 0.5 and a rate of accuracy
    of 99.5%. The accuracy of ML algorithms is determined through training and validation
    processes. Various machine learning algorithms provide satisfactory results after
    performing analysis of the collected data. As we can see, the accuracy rates of
    the NB and RF model of 98.8% and the MSE of 0.16 are higher compared to KNN, SVM,
    and LR with successive results: (98.3%/1.66), (99.3%/0.66), and (99.5%/0.5), respectively.
    5. Future Work Recommendations To increase the efficiency of the system, some
    recommendations are listed for future research work: (1) To maintain the soil
    quality, there is a need to monitor soil salt rate and pH level of the soil. (2)
    To increase the crop production to fulfill the future needs, controlling and monitoring
    of the fertilization process are required to be utilized with the existing smart
    irrigation process. (3) Improvement of the system is done by adding new controllers
    and sensors to increase the stability, reliability, structure, and working efficiency
    of the system. (4) Artificial intelligent system will be installed with the irrigation
    system to predict the user action, rainfall condition patterns, and time to harvest
    extra. (5) To estimate the water requirement for irrigation process, water meter
    can be installed in the irrigation systems. (6) In this project, motor is controlled
    from mobile application, fully automated motor system should be installed. (7)
    Cameras can be used for detecting the deeds and for controlling and monitoring
    the plant growth. (8) Alarm system can be installed in the smart agriculture system
    for alerting the farmers regarding the fire and the any movement in the agriculture
    field. This can be achieved using the fire sensor and motion detector sensor.
    (9) Decision making can be done using the big data and artificial intelligent
    technologies. These technologies will help the smart irrigation for past and future
    data prediction in the IoT system. 6. Conclusion Increased production is an important
    first step since it will be necessary to meet the projected 70% rise in global
    food consumption by 2050. The management of water consumption for irrigation is
    another aspect of it. In this research, a hybrid irrigation system is suggested.
    Three modules make up our suggested approach to smart irrigation: As the first
    module, the sensor network identifies variables affecting the requirement for
    water. We use sensors such as DHT11, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, a wind
    sensor, a rain sensor, and a water level sensor to measure temperature, soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity in the air, wind speed, rain status, and reservoir water
    level. In the second module, we utilize the ThingSpeak cloud server and the Bylnk
    cloud server as IoT servers to send and receive data. In the third module, we
    used machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and determine how accurate
    the decision-making process was to determine the need for irrigation. KNN, NB,
    LR, and RF were just a few of the models we used to analyze the data we collected.
    When comparing the accuracy rates and mean squared errors of different models,
    the NB and RF models have an accuracy rate of 98.8% and MSE of 0.16. In comparison,
    the KNN, SVM, and logistic regression models have accuracy rates of 98.3%, 99.3%,
    and 99.5%, with corresponding MSE values of 1.66, 0.66, and 0.5, respectively.

    smart agriculture emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u
    (t)]+ γ E P total (t), ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t

    ∀p∈U∪M, ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p , ∀p∈U∪M.
    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of
    the estimated Q-value Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) from the target
    value y( t ~ ) [21], L( θ u ( t ~ ))=E[(y( t ~ )− Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~
    ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (23) View Source where, y( t ~ )= r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u
    ( t ~ +1) Q u ( o u ( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1); θ u ( t ~ )) and a u ( t ~ +1) indicates
    the agent’s action generated by the DNN at t ~ +1 , given the observation o u
    ( t ~ +1) . At each iteration, the deep Q -function approximator is trained to
    learn the best estimate of the Q-function by minimizing the loss function L( θ
    u ( t ~ )) . To improve the stability of the algorithm and cope with samples correlation,
    as depicted in Fig. 4, two novel techniques, namely Fixed Target Network [51]
    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t
    ~ )) = E D [( r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u ( t ~ +1) Q u (b( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1);
    θ ´ u ( t ~ )) − Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (24) View
    Source where θ ´ u ( t ~ ) denotes the target network parameters, and the expectation
    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u
    ( t ~ )= ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u ( t ~ )= Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )= ζ k u ( t ~ )= δ NFV ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u
    ( t ~ )+ δ AoI Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )+ δ E P total ( t ~ ), 1 K ∑ k∈S ζ k u ( t ~ )

    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

    development, nourishing a growing global population. However, traditional agricultural
    practices face numerous challenges, including diminishing arable land, environmental
    degradation, and increasing demands for food production [1]. Innovative approaches
    incorporating advanced materials have emerged to address these challenges and
    enhance the efficiency of agricultural systems. Among these materials, two-dimensional
    (2D) based hybrid materials have shown great promise in revolutionizing the agriculture
    industry. Two-dimensional materials refer to thin sheets of materials with only
    one or a few atoms in thickness [2]. These materials possess unique properties
    due to their ultra-thin nature, high surface-to-volume ratio, and exceptional
    mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties [3, 4]. They have garnered significant
    attention in various scientific disciplines, including materials science, electronics,
    energy storage, and agriculture [2]. The utilization of 2D-based hybrid materials
    in agriculture offers several advantages over conventional practices [5]. Firstly,
    their large surface area allows for increased absorption and retention of nutrients
    and water, leading to improved plant growth and development. Secondly, their unique
    electrical and optical properties enable the development of sensors and actuators
    that can monitor and regulate various environmental factors, optimizing crop growth
    conditions [6]. Additionally, the incorporation of 2D materials into hybrid structures
    can enhance mechanical strength, stability, and durability, ensuring long-term
    performance in agricultural applications. Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms
    arranged in a honeycomb lattice, is one of the most extensively studied 2D materials
    [7, 8]. Its exceptional electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical
    strength make it an ideal candidate for various agricultural applications [9,
    10]. For instance, graphene-based sensors can detect soil moisture, temperature,
    and nutrient levels in real-time, providing precise data for efficient irrigation
    and fertilization. Graphene-based nanocomposites have also demonstrated the ability
    to improve soil water-holding capacity and nutrient retention, reducing water
    and fertilizer consumption while enhancing crop yields [11, 12]. Transition metal
    dichalcogenides (TMDs) are another class of 2D materials that hold tremendous
    potential in agriculture. These materials exhibit unique optical and electronic
    properties, making them suitable for applications such as photocatalysis and plant
    disease detection. TMD-based hybrid materials have shown promise in the removal
    of pollutants from soil and water, contributing to soil remediation and environmental
    sustainability [13, 14]. Moreover, the integration of TMDs with conventional materials
    can enhance the efficiency of pesticide delivery systems, reducing chemical usage
    and minimizing environmental risks [15]. The synthesis and fabrication of 2D-based
    hybrid materials for agriculture require precise control and manipulation of the
    material''s structure and properties. Various techniques such as chemical vapor
    deposition (CVD) [16, 17], physical vapor deposition (PVD) [18], and electrochemical
    deposition have been employed to synthesize 2D materials with desired properties.
    The combination of these techniques with conventional fabrication methods allows
    for the development of hybrid materials with tailored characteristics suitable
    for specific agricultural applications. The potential applications of 2D-based
    hybrid materials in agriculture are vast and diverse. Improved nutrient delivery
    systems can be achieved through the incorporation of 2D materials in fertilizers,
    enabling controlled release and efficient utilization of nutrients by plants.
    Enhanced crop growth and productivity can be realized by optimizing environmental
    conditions using 2D-based sensors and actuators. Additionally, the remediation
    of contaminated soils and water bodies can be facilitated by the use of 2D-based
    adsorbents and catalysts [14]. Despite the significant potential of 2D-based hybrid
    materials, several challenges need to be addressed for their widespread implementation
    in agricultural systems. Environmental and health concerns associated with the
    use of these advanced materials require thorough investigation to ensure their
    safe and sustainable use [19]. Furthermore, economic feasibility and scalability
    need to be considered to ensure the practicality of these materials for small-scale
    and large-scale farming operations. Continued research and development efforts
    are required to overcome these challenges and further unlock the full potential
    of 2D-based hybrid materials in agriculture. The future perspectives of 2D-based

    with biodegradable polymers can lead to the development of environmentally friendly
    and sustainable agricultural products [20]. Additionally, nanotechnology and material
    engineering advancements will enable the production of 2D-based hybrid materials
    with tailored properties for specific agricultural needs. One area of future exploration
    is the development of smart nanomaterials that can respond to environmental stimuli
    and regulate plant growth processes [21]. These materials can potentially release
    growth-promoting substances, such as hormones or signaling molecules, in response
    to specific conditions, optimizing plant development and increasing crop yields.
    Furthermore, the integration of nano sensors into 2D-based hybrid materials can
    facilitate real-time monitoring of crop health, pest infestation, and disease
    outbreaks, enabling early detection and targeted intervention [22]. The utilization
    of 2D-based hybrid materials in precision agriculture is another area of great
    interest. Precision agriculture aims to optimize farming practices by using technology
    and data-driven decision-making. By incorporating 2D materials into precision
    farming systems, farmers can gather accurate and timely information about soil
    conditions, nutrient levels, and plant health, leading to efficient resource management
    and reduced environmental impact. Collaboration between scientists, engineers,
    agronomists, and farmers is crucial for the successful implementation of 2D-based
    hybrid materials in agriculture. The interdisciplinary nature of this field requires
    a holistic approach, considering not only the technical aspects but also the social,
    economic, and environmental implications [23]. Regulatory frameworks and policies
    need to be developed to ensure these materials’ safe and responsible use, addressing
    concerns related to human health, ecosystem impact, and ethical considerations.
    Therefore, two-dimensional-based hybrid materials hold tremendous potential to
    revolutionize the agriculture system. Their unique properties and functionalities

    Methods Solution-based methods are extensively used for synthesizing hybrid materials
    in agriculture. One common technique is the sol–gel method, where precursor solutions
    are mixed and undergo hydrolysis and condensation reactions to form a gel-like
    structure followed by subsequent drying and heat treatment result in the formation
    of hybrid materials [43]. This procedure allows for the incorporation of different
    materials, such as 2D materials, polymers, nanoparticles, and organic compounds,
    into the final product. Solution-based methods offer versatility and control over
    the composition, morphology, and properties of these materials [44]. 3.2 Chemical
    Vapour Deposition (CVD) Chemical vapour deposition is a technique frequently employed
    for the synthesis of 2D materials and their integration into hybrid materials.
    In CVD, precursor gases are introduced into a reaction chamber, where they decompose
    and deposit on a substrate to form a thin film. By controlling the reaction parameters,
    such as temperature, pressure, and gas composition, hybrid materials can be fabricated
    with precise switch over the composition and morphology. CVD allows for the growth
    of large-area films and the integration of multiple materials, enabling the development
    of complex hybrid structures [16, 17]. 3.3 Electrospinning Electrospinning is

    hybrid materials with unique surface functionalities. 3.9 3D Printing 3D printing,
    also known as additive manufacturing, is a technique that allows for the fabrication
    of complex three-dimensional structures layer by layer. By incorporating 2D materials,
    polymers, or nanoparticles into the printing materials, hybrid structures with
    tailored compositions and functionalities can be created. 3D printing offers precise
    control over the geometry and internal architecture of the fabricated objects,
    enabling the development of customized agricultural tools, sensors, and structures
    [50]. 3.10 Electrochemical Deposition Electrochemical deposition involves the
    electrodeposition of materials onto a conductive substrate using an electrolyte
    solution. By controlling the deposition parameters, such as current density and
    deposition time, hybrid materials can be synthesized with controlled composition,
    morphology, and thickness. Electrochemical deposition is a versatile technique
    that can be used to integrate 2D materials, nanoparticles, or other materials
    onto electrodes, enabling the development of hybrid electrochemical sensors or
    energy storage devices for agricultural applications. The field of hybrid materials
    in agriculture continues to advance with the development of new synthesis and
    fabrication techniques. Each method offers unique advantages in terms of control

    modification, self-assembly, physical mixing and blending, templating and replication,
    3D printing, and electrochemical deposition are just some of the techniques employed
    to create hybrid materials with enhanced functionalities for agricultural systems
    [44]. By leveraging these techniques, researchers and engineers can tailor hybrid
    materials to address specific challenges in crop yield improvement, soil quality
    enhancement, and sustainable agriculture [48]. 4 Applications of 2D-Based Hybrid
    Materials in Agriculture The 2D materials are going to be the backbone of next
    generation agriculture to produce more by expensing less. Some of its potential
    applications are outlined and summarized below (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Various applications
    of 2D-based hybrid materials in Agriculture Full size image 4.1 Improved Nutrient
    Delivery Systems Efficient nutrient delivery is essential for promoting healthy
    plant growth and maximizing agricultural productivity. Traditional methods of
    nutrient application, such as soil fertilization and foliar spraying, often suffer
    from issues such as nutrient leaching, low absorption rates, and uneven distribution
    [51]. In recent years, the integration of two-dimensional (2D) hybrid materials
    in agriculture has shown great promise in addressing these challenges. By combining
    the unique properties of 2D materials with other materials, hybrid systems offer
    innovative solutions for improving nutrient delivery and enhancing plant nutrition.
    This document aims to explore the concept of improved nutrient delivery systems
    through 2D-hybrid materials in agriculture and highlight their potential benefits
    and applications. 4.2 Enhanced Nutrient Retention and Controlled Release One of
    the key advantages of using 2D-hybrid materials in nutrient delivery systems is
    their ability to enhance nutrient retention and facilitate controlled release
    [52]. By incorporating 2D materials, such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides
    (TMDs), into nutrient carriers or matrices, hybrid materials can improve the adsorption
    and retention of nutrients. These materials possess large surface areas and high
    adsorption capacities, allowing them to effectively bind and retain essential
    nutrients, preventing their loss through leaching. Additionally, the controlled
    release properties of hybrid materials can be tailored by adjusting factors such
    as composition, morphology, and interlayer spacing, enabling nutrients to be released
    gradually over time, matching the plant''s uptake requirements. 4.3 Improved Nutrient
    Uptake Efficiency 2D-hybrid materials can also enhance nutrient uptake efficiency
    by promoting root growth and improving nutrient absorption. Incorporating 2D materials
    into soil amendments or hydrogels can enhance soil structure, porosity, and water-holding
    capacity, thereby creating a favourable environment for root development. The
    increased surface area of 2D materials facilitates the adsorption of nutrients
    in the root zone, making them readily available for plant uptake [53]. Furthermore,
    the use of hybrid materials can enhance the solubility and bioavailability of
    nutrients, ensuring their effective absorption by plant roots and reducing nutrient
    wastage. 4.4 Targeted Nutrient Delivery and Site-Specific Application The precise
    targeting of nutrients to specific plant organs or growth stages is critical for
    optimizing nutrient utilization and minimizing environmental impact. 2D-hybrid
    materials offer the potential for targeted nutrient delivery through functionalization
    and modification. For example, hybrid materials can be engineered to respond to
    specific triggers such as pH, temperature, or enzymatic activity, enabling controlled
    nutrient release at specific plant growth stages or in response to environmental
    cues. This targeted approach ensures that nutrients are delivered directly to
    the intended sites, reducing the risk of wastage and optimizing plant nutrient
    uptake efficiency) [52]. 4.5 Reduced Environmental Impact Improved nutrient delivery
    systems through 2D-hybrid materials have the potential to reduce the environmental
    impact associated with conventional nutrient application methods. The controlled-release
    nature of hybrid materials minimizes nutrient leaching, decreasing the risk of
    water contamination and eutrophication [54]. Additionally, the site-specific nutrient
    delivery enabled by hybrid materials ensures that nutrients are delivered where
    they are most needed, reducing excess nutrient application and subsequent environmental
    pollution [55]. These sustainable nutrient delivery systems contribute to environmentally
    responsible agricultural practices and promote the conservation of natural resources
    [56]. 5 Enhanced Crop Growth and Productivity The global population is steadily
    increasing, putting significant pressure on agricultural systems to meet the rising
    demand for food. To address this challenge, innovative approaches are required
    to enhance crop growth and productivity [52, 57]. One such approach is the integration
    of two-dimensional (2D) hybrid materials in agriculture. These materials, combined
    with other components, offer unique properties and functionalities that can positively
    impact crop performance [58]. 5.1 Improved Nutrient Availability Optimal nutrient
    availability is essential for promoting plant growth and maximizing crop productivity.
    2D-hybrid materials play a significant role in improving nutrient availability
    and uptake efficiency. By incorporating 2D materials, such as graphene or transition
    metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), into fertilizers or soil amendments, hybrid systems
    can enhance nutrient retention and release characteristics [53]. The high surface
    area and adsorption capacity of 2D materials enable them to bind and retain nutrients,
    preventing their loss through leaching. Moreover, these materials can improve
    the solubility and bioavailability of nutrients, making them more accessible to
    plant roots and increasing their uptake efficiency. 5.2 Enhanced Water Management
    and Efficiency Water scarcity is a major challenge in agriculture, particularly
    in regions with limited water resources. 2D-hybrid materials offer the potential
    to improve water management and efficiency in crop production. By incorporating
    hydrophilic 2D materials into soil amendments or mulches, hybrid systems can enhance
    water retention in the root zone, reducing water loss through evaporation and
    improving the availability of water to plants [59]. Additionally, the use of 2D
    materials with water-responsive properties allows for controlled water release,
    ensuring that plants receive water when needed. This improved water management
    can lead to better crop growth, especially in drought-prone areas, and contribute
    to sustainable water usage in agriculture [58]. 5.3 Enhanced Pest and Disease
    Management Pests and diseases pose significant threats to crop health and productivity.
    Integrating 2D-hybrid materials in pest and disease management strategies can
    provide novel solutions to combat these challenges. For instance, incorporating
    antimicrobial 2D materials into crop protection formulations can enhance the efficacy
    of pesticides, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks and improving crop health.
    Similarly, the use of 2D materials with insect-repellent properties can help deter
    pests and minimize crop damage [60]. The antimicrobial and insect-repellent functionalities
    of 2D-hybrid materials offer environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional
    pesticide use, promoting sustainable pest and disease management practices [61].
    5.4 Enhanced Stress Tolerance and Resilience Crop plants often face various environmental
    stresses, such as heat, drought, salinity, and heavy metal contamination, which
    can negatively impact their growth and productivity. 2D-hybrid materials have
    shown potential in enhancing stress tolerance and resilience in crops [62]. By
    incorporating stress-responsive 2D materials into plant growth substrates or seed
    coatings, hybrid systems can provide plants with additional protection and support
    under challenging environmental conditions [63]. These materials can help regulate
    plant responses to stress, mitigate oxidative damage, and promote the production
    of stress-related signalling molecules, ultimately enhancing crop resilience and
    productivity in adverse environments. 6 Soil Remediation and Pollution Control
    Soil pollution is a significant environmental issue that affects agricultural
    productivity and poses risks to human health. Contamination of soil by heavy metals,
    pesticides, industrial pollutants, and other toxic substances can have detrimental
    effects on plant growth, soil fertility, and ecosystem health. In recent years,
    the integration of two-dimensional (2D) hybrid materials in agriculture has emerged
    as a promising approach for soil remediation and pollution control [64]. These
    materials, combined with other components, offer unique properties and functionalities
    that can effectively remove, immobilize, or degrade pollutants in the soil. 6.1
    Contaminant Adsorption and Immobilization One of the key advantages of using 2D-hybrid
    materials in soil remediation is their high adsorption capacity and affinity for
    contaminants. Certain 2D materials, such as graphene oxide and layered double
    hydroxides, possess large surface areas and abundant functional groups that can
    effectively adsorb a wide range of pollutants and heavy materials [65]. By incorporating
    these materials into soil amendments or barriers, hybrid systems can enhance the
    removal and immobilization of contaminants. The adsorption mechanisms involve
    electrostatic interactions, ion exchange, and surface complexation, allowing 2D-hybrid
    materials to selectively capture and retain pollutants, preventing their movement
    through the soil profile and reducing the risk of groundwater contamination. 6.2
    Pollutant Degradation and Transformation In addition to adsorption and immobilization,
    some 2D-hybrid materials possess inherent catalytic properties that can facilitate
    pollutant degradation and transformation. For example, certain transition metal
    dichalcogenides (TMDs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can serve as catalysts
    for the degradation of organic pollutants through processes like photocatalysis
    or advanced oxidation [55]. These materials can generate reactive oxygen species
    or promote redox reactions, breaking down pollutants into less toxic compounds
    or mineralizing them into harmless substances. The integration of such materials
    in soil remediation strategies offers the potential for in situ pollutant degradation
    and the restoration of soil quality. 6.3 Enhanced Microbial Activity and Bioremediation
    Microorganisms play a crucial role in the degradation and detoxification of pollutants
    in the soil. 2D-hybrid materials can enhance microbial activity and facilitate
    bioremediation processes. By incorporating materials with antimicrobial properties
    or those that can promote microbial growth and activity, hybrid systems create
    a favourable environment for pollutant-degrading microorganisms [66]. These materials
    can serve as carriers for beneficial microorganisms, providing protection, nutrients,
    and a suitable microenvironment for their growth and activity. This synergy between
    2D materials and microorganisms can accelerate the natural biodegradation processes
    and enhance the effectiveness of bioremediation strategies. 6.4 Reduced Environmental
    Risk and Enhanced Soil Health The use of 2D-hybrid materials in soil remediation
    and pollution control offers several benefits in terms of reducing environmental
    risks and enhancing soil health. By effectively adsorbing or degrading pollutants,
    these materials can mitigate the mobility and bioavailability of contaminants,
    reducing their potential for environmental exposure and subsequent risks to ecosystems
    and human health [67]. Moreover, the immobilization or transformation of pollutants
    can lead to the restoration of soil fertility and the enhancement of soil structure
    and microbial activity. This, in turn, promotes the recovery of soil health, nutrient
    cycling, and plant growth, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices
    [68]. 7 Enhanced Pesticide and Fertilizer Efficiency Pesticides and fertilizers
    play a crucial role in modern agriculture by protecting crops from pests and providing
    essential nutrients for optimal growth. However, their excessive and inefficient
    use can have detrimental effects on the environment, human health, and agricultural
    sustainability. To address these challenges, the integration of two-dimensional
    (2D) hybrid materials in agriculture has emerged as a promising approach to enhance

    combined with other components, offer unique properties and functionalities that
    can improve pesticide targeting, reduce environmental pollution, and enhance fertilizer
    utilization [70]. 7.1 Enhanced Pesticide Targeting and Delivery One of the key
    advantages of using 2D-hybrid materials in agriculture is their ability to improve
    pesticide targeting and delivery. By incorporating these materials into pesticide
    formulations or coatings, hybrid systems can enhance the adhesion and absorption
    of pesticides to plant surfaces, improving their efficacy and reducing the amount
    of pesticide required [71]. The high surface area and functionalization of 2D
    materials allow for better interaction with pests and enhance the penetration
    of active ingredients into plant tissues. This targeted and controlled delivery
    of pesticides reduces off-target effects, minimizes environmental pollution, and

    fertilizers can optimize their effectiveness and minimize waste. 2D-hybrid materials
    enable the development of smart and controlled release systems for agricultural
    inputs. These materials can be functionalized with stimuli-responsive properties,
    such as pH, temperature, or moisture sensitivity, allowing for the release of
    active ingredients based on specific environmental conditions or plant needs [74].
    This precise control over the release of pesticides and fertilizers ensures targeted
    application, minimizes losses, and maximizes their efficacy, resulting in improved
    crop protection and nutrient management [75]. The integration of 2D-hybrid materials
    in agriculture offers significant potential to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness
    of pesticides and fertilizers. Through improved pesticide targeting and delivery,
    reduced drift and volatilization, enhanced fertilizer utilization, and smart release
    systems, these materials contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. 9 Optimization

    rice productionsmart farmingfood securityagriculture sustainability Rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) is the primary food source for an estimated 3.5 billion people globally,
    which contributes up to 50% of the daily caloric intake for Asian populations
    (Li et al, 2018). More than half of the world’s population relies on rice as a
    staple diet, making it the second most extensively produced cereal crop (Giri
    et al, 2022). It is also a frontrunner in the struggle against global poverty
    and hunger as well as the primary staple food and a significant source of income
    for worldwide populations. In this regard, rice is crucial to the economy and
    those with lower incomes in promoting agricultural growth and reducing poverty.
    As the proportion of income from agriculture diminishes due to the faster growth
    of other industries, the significance of rice continues to decline economically
    (Adjao and Staatz, 2015). The rice production must be regulated in order to meet
    the demand of the expanding population. As a strategic crop, rice production should
    be increased globally to ensure food security and sustainability. Most countries
    were unprepared for the significant increase in food prices when the food crisis
    of 2007 to 2008 hit, particularly the price of rice (Nodin et al, 2022). Stable
    rice prices in most of the world’s marketplaces have been considered a sign of
    food security. The strategy of rice production for ensuring food security takes
    into consideration of rice marketing, and import and export trends. For several
    developing countries, rice is crucial to food security, socio-cultural practices,
    and government strategic initiatives. The efficient use of resources including
    labour, water, land, and energy along with a lower environmental footprint is
    needed in order to sustain food security and support economic development (Devkota
    et al, 2020). Conventional rice production needs to evolve to make room for additional
    resources, an effective and profitable system for future generations. It is crucial
    to take the sustainability of food systems into account, especially better- utilizing
    rice production in order to feed 10 billion people in 2050 (Saha et al, 2021).
    Typically, developed countries will need to raise rice production, while least
    developed countries will need to maintain their rice production to meet their
    own needs. A sustainable approach to rice production is thus becoming even more
    vital in tandem with the growing population, limitation of fertile land, and insufficient
    natural resources. Achieving self-sufficiency in rice production towards food
    security has significant consequences for a stable supply of rice. The rice dominance
    as a food commodity guarantees the stability in the whole operation of rice production.
    In the early 1990s, self-sufficiency was achieved from the increased per capita
    availability and intensive rice production (Vaghefi et al, 2016). However, since
    then, there have been certain challenges with intensive rice production due to
    the resource shortages for modern agricultural practices. For this reason, advances
    in smart farming in rice production have empowered the supply in accordance with
    the growing population. Smart farming is an agricultural management strategy supported
    by technology that monitors and assesses the requirements of specific areas and
    crops (Alfred et al, 2021). It is known for the use of information and data technology
    for the optimization of sophisticated farming systems. Instead of emphasising
    data storage, access, or applications, it concentrates on how the gathered information
    about rice production may be used intelligently. Utilizing smart farming technologies
    will undoubtedly help farmers with a variety of tasks to boost rice production.
    The ability of smart farming for rice production is one of the key issues at stake
    in the discussion of how to guarantee global food security and sustainability.
    By utilizing natural resources, smart farming adopts the advances of artificial
    intelligence to meet the demands of the expanding population. Smart farming, with
    the integration of various technologies, offers huge potential to create automated
    operations with minimal human intervention. In this sense, mechanization, efficiency,
    and productivity are required at all rice production stages due to the global
    population increase and the limited availability of agricultural lands (Bacco
    et al, 2018). As a result, implementing precision agriculture or smart farming
    is essential for coping methods in the settings of food security and sustainability.
    Therefore, this review addresses the global production and consumption of rice.
    The recent applications of smart farming technologies have been highlighted with
    the technological advancements for sustainable rice production. The underlying
    challenges, trends as well as future prospects of rice production in food security
    and sustainability are also elucidated. Trends of global rice production In the
    past, global rice production has been relatively modest compared with crops such
    as wheat, maize, and soybeans. However, there was a notable expansion in rice
    production during the 1980s, following trade liberalization efforts by several
    rice-producing nations. This trend was further boosted by the implementation of
    the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994 (Abera et al, 2019). During
    the early stages, government intervention held a pivotal position in rice production,
    consumption, and trade due to inadequate food supply, low consumer income, and
    limited foreign exchange earnings (Xie et al, 2014). However, with economic development,
    government policies have shifted towards market liberalization, characterized
    by the establishment of individual production systems, the elimination of consumption
    subsidies, and the abolition of export taxation. This policy evolution has generally
    transitioned from safeguarding consumer benefits to protecting the interests of
    producers. In terms of trade policy, export taxation measures are typically introduced
    when consumer income is low, and the government is committed to ensuring ample
    domestic supplies at affordable and stable prices. The absence of a coherent policy
    for the development and promotion of rice production, primarily due to data limitations,
    will inevitably impact future planning and management strategies for rice production.
    In 1961, only 215 million tonnes of rice were produced worldwide, even though
    rice farming had been ongoing for thousands of years (Ali Chandio et al, 2022).
    The global harvested area of rice was recorded at 1.65 × 108 hm2, whereas global
    rice production obtained 7.76 × 108 t in 2022, respectively (FAOSTAT, 2023). During
    the period from 2016 to 2023, there was a significant increase in global rice
    production and the area of harvested rice (Fig. 1). Enhanced rice productivity
    is probably the main reason for the increase in global rice production and harvested
    area during this period. Global rice demand is expected to be equivalent to an
    annual growth rate of approximately 1%, ranging from 5.03 × 108 to 5.44 × 108
    t by 2030 (FAO, 2014). Although shifting consumption habits have an impact, population
    expansion is primarily driving this demand growth. This outlook emphasizes the
    necessity of increasing rice production to satisfy the growing demand globally.

    Fig. 1. Harvested area (A) and production (B) of rice worldwide from 2016 to 2022
    (FAOSTAT, 2023). Between the 1940s and the late 1960s, the Green Revolution or
    known as the Third Agricultural Revolution led to a rise in agricultural productivity
    among developing countries primarily as a result of technology transfer and innovations
    (Muthayya et al, 2014). The global rice production is projected to keep pace with
    demand and consumption. Accumulation by rice-importing countries, particularly
    China, would maintain relative stability, whereas Thailand would focus on liquidation
    from the government stockpiles (Abera et al, 2019). Current population predictions
    indicate that Asia will require an additional 8 × 106 t of rice annually despite
    the fact that rice production is decreasing (Mohidem et al, 2022). The demand
    for rice has increased along with the preference and taste of customers for rice-based
    cuisines, as a result of the growing Asian communities living in western regions.
    Therefore, to fulfill the rapidly rising demand and discerning consumer needs,
    rice production in the future will need to greatly enhance resource efficiency.
    It is anticipated that rice will continue to play a significant role in human
    diets in the near future. The regional distribution of rice production has remained
    relatively stable over the past decades, with the highest share dominated by Asia
    at 89.7%, followed by Africa at 4.9%, Americas at 4.8%, Europe at 0.5%, and Oceania
    at 0.1%, respectively (FAOSTAT, 2023). Asia’s rapid agricultural revolution has
    driven the regional transformation and rapid economic development (Ali Chandio
    et al, 2022). Americas and Africa both display similar patterns, although the
    changes in rice production have been less dramatic. The significant shifts in
    the regional production share of rice, particularly in Asia, are driven by the
    underlying dynamics of rapid income growth, supported by in-depth economic research
    and historical context. These issues in rice production should be addressed through
    a systematic and holistic approach. Additionally, the anticipated improvement
    in the customers’ standard of living and income level is expected to have an influence
    on rice production. In the near future, it is projected that the global rice trade
    will significantly increase due to the increased consumption of rice in non-Asian
    countries such as several regions of Africa and Europe. By deeply investing in
    and widely applying scientific advancements and technologies, particularly biological
    technologies, in rice production, there will be a substantial increase in both
    the productivity and quality of rice in domestic and overseas markets. Given the
    varying cultural and taste preferences for rice consumption across different regions
    of the world, it is anticipated that the long-term trend of rice consumption will
    continue to rise. However, marketing demands are becoming more intricate due to
    expanding urban societies and a growing middle-class population. This demographic
    shift leads to increasing demand of high-quality rice with diverse nutritional
    values and safety assurances, while the demand of poor-quality rice diminishes.
    The top rice producers worldwide in 2022 were China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia,
    Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Pakistan (Table 1).
    China achieved the highest total rice production in 2020, with 2.08 × 108 t, followed
    by India and Bangladesh, with 1.96 × 108 and 5.71 × 107 t, respectively. In several
    countries, such as the United Republic of Tanzania, Madagascar, Peru, Colombia,
    Mali, and Guinea, rice production was on par with some Asian countries, such as
    Laos, Malaysia, Korea, and Sri Lanka. The production quantities of rice are expected
    to rise significantly in the coming years. This is vital as rice production quantities
    are important for maintaining per capita rice consumption worldwide. Asian countries
    will likely continue to dominate rice demand in the future due to factors including
    population expansion, dietary changes, and increased yields from land intensification.
    Given that rice remains the primary staple in leading producing nations, the establishment
    of domestic strategic reserves holds paramount significance for ensuring food
    security. Table 1. Top 30 rice producers worldwide in 2022 (FAOSTAT, 2023). Country/Region

    years, global rice production and consumption have witnessed significant trends
    and patterns, which can be further analyzed by segmenting the data based on the
    type of rice. This segmentation allows for a more detailed understanding of the
    dynamics within each rice category, providing insights into the factors influencing
    production and consumption. Total global rice production has generally increased
    over the past two decades due to population growth, food demand expanding, and
    improvements in agricultural practices. The production growth rate may vary among
    different regions, with some countries experiencing substantial increases in output,
    driven by advancements in technology, irrigation systems, and farming techniques.
    It may also be influenced by factors such as weather conditions, land availability,
    government policies, and market demand. Fragrant rice varieties, including basmati
    and jasmine, have shown a rising demand globally, driven by their unique aroma,
    flavour, and cultural significance. Production of fragrant rice has expanded in
    countries such as India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam, which are renowned for
    their high-quality aromatic rice. Increasing international trade and export opportunities
    have contributed to the growth of fragrant rice production and consumption. Non-fragrant
    rice, including parboiled and glutinous varieties, remains the dominant type in
    global rice production and consumption. Countries, like China, India, Indonesia,
    and Bangladesh, are major producers and consumers of non-fragrant rice. The production
    of non-fragrant rice has shown steady growth, primarily driven by the increasing
    demand for staple food in densely populated regions. Global rice consumption has
    followed diverse trends over the past two decades, influenced by factors such
    as population growth, urbanization, dietary changes, and economic development.
    In some regions, there has been a shift from traditional rice-based diets to more
    varied food choices, resulting in changes in consumption patterns. The consumption
    of fragrant rice has increased in certain markets, driven by factors like globalization,
    cultural preferences, and rising incomes. Non-fragrant rice remains the mainstay
    of global consumption, particularly in countries with large populations and high
    rice consumption rates. Understanding these production and consumption trends,
    along with the segmentation by rice types, helps policymakers, researchers, and
    businesses make informed decisions related to agricultural policies, trade strategies,
    and market development. It also aids in identifying opportunities for sustainable
    production, addressing food security concerns, and meeting the evolving preferences
    of consumers worldwide. Applications of smart farming in rice Utilizing sustainable
    and smart farming technology is necessary to meet the need for rice production
    with higher yield and quality through mechanization and automation. Smart farming
    is derived from the rise of various applications of industrialization and agricultural
    modernization. Artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing,
    big data, and other information technologies are specifically incorporated to
    deeply integrate with rice production applications for smart control and to deliver
    a precise management system, providing crop growth, predictive modelling in visual
    diagnosis, remote control, pest infestation, and disaster warning (Li et al, 2023).
    The fundamental element in smart farming is the extensive use of information,
    knowledge, and technology with the utmost goals including labour-saving, increased
    production scale, maximum yield capacity as well as substitution of manual operation
    and management. Smart farming has various applications in rice production, including
    yield estimation, smart irrigation systems, monitoring disease and growth as well
    as predicting quality and classification. Table 2 shows the applications of smart
    farming technologies for rice production. Table 2. Applications of smart farming

    Rice yield estimation Rice yield estimation is very important due to decision-
    making according to the potential reduction in the crop yield. These innovative
    approaches provide real- time monitoring and data-driven insights, allowing farmers
    to optimize resource management, make informed decisions, and enhance overall
    productivity. The integration of smart farming techniques in rice yield estimation
    holds immense potential for improving crop management strategies, maximizing yields,
    and ensuring sustainable rice production. Accurate estimation of rice yield is
    crucial for effective crop management, food security, and agricultural planning.
    Muthusinghe et al (2019) evaluated rice harvest prediction using two different
    machine learning algorithms. A platform has been designed specifically for the
    smart farming concept in paddy cultivation, incorporating two key modules: a prediction
    module for forecasting paddy harvest and a prediction module for anticipating
    rice demand. The recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
    models were used to successfully predict the rice harvest with a training accuracy
    of 78% and testing accuracy of 75%. Elders et al (2022) discussed the application
    of remote sensing in predicting rice yield. In heterogeneous smallholder agricultural
    landscapes, the combination of moderate spatial resolution Sentinel-2 imagery
    and a crop cut calibrated random forest model has proven to be an effective tool
    for predicting crop type and estimating rice yields. Based on the findings, the
    random forest model was developed to predict the rice yield which obtained prediction
    accuracy higher than 80%. In another approach, Xu et al (2020) studied rice panicle
    features by counting the rice panicle yield in the field. The optimal feature
    learning network and the adaptive multi-scale hybrid window were selected by quantifying
    and analysing the correlation between the receptive field, input image size, and
    average panicle dimensions. This approach effectively maximizes the representation
    of panicle features. Additionally, a fusion algorithm is employed to eliminate
    duplicate counting of broken panicles, resulting in an accurate estimation of
    the final panicle count. A multi-scale hybrid window panicle detect model was
    developed to predict the rice panicle counting with an accuracy higher than 87%.
    Hama et al (2020) investigated the rice yield estimation using an unmanned aerial
    vehicle remote sensing integrated with solar radiation datasets. The unmanned
    aerial vehicle remote sensing-derived normalized difference vegetation index is
    employed during the heading stage, as well as solar radiation data from the geostationary
    satellite Himawari-8 and the polar orbiting satellite Aqua/MODIS. The results
    obtained a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76 and a root mean square error
    (RMSE) of 26.5. By combining these data sources, the study sought to improve the
    precision and reliability of yield estimation for paddy rice crops. Ogunti et
    al (2018) reported various applications of rice yield monitoring systems. A newly
    developed mobile application known as Connected Farm Field App was compared with
    existing applications which could enable farmers to conveniently record detailed
    information about their farming operations using a smartphone or tablet. The findings
    successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of a decision support system using
    mobile applications in order to help farmers monitor rice yield. It is worth mentioning
    that understanding the rice yield estimation is important for monitoring the growth
    of rice. Smart rice irrigation system Water is a vital resource for rice production.
    Nevertheless, its scarcity is becoming a growing concern for farmers. Irrigation,
    a non-natural technique of water delivering for rice production, helps boost crop
    yield (Selvaraj et al, 2022). The efficacy and consistency of the smart irrigation
    system can be monitored through different data-based frameworks by considering
    factors such as soil, climate, temperature, and harvest information. It is crucial
    to use water resources for efficient rice production, as this can open the door
    for an automated irrigation system, which is constantly being developed for efficient
    agriculture. Bamurigire et al (2021) reported the application of an IoT-Markov
    chain process based on expert knowledge and system datasets for fertilization
    and irrigation control systems. Likewise, Pham et al (2021) developed an IoT system
    to improve water efficiency in alternate wetting and drying irrigation. This system
    is feasible, in water saving 13% to 20% more water than manual practice. It consists
    of four elements: a cloud-based management platform, end-user applications, controller/gateway,
    and solar-powered water sensor. González Perea et al (2021) evaluated a pressurized
    irrigation system using different algorithms, including fuzzy logic, artificial
    neural network (ANN), and multi-objective genetic algorithms. The results yielded
    an R2 of 0.70 and an RMSE of 19.9, respectively. Rowshon et al (2019) determined
    the water demand modelling for rice irrigation by generating several hydro-climatic
    parameters. They used a multi-model (ensemble) projection to create a climate-smart
    decision support system for monitoring water resources under different climate
    conditions. Winter et al (2017) developed a water evaluation and planning support
    decision system. They denoted that rice yields appear to follow a step function,
    when there is sufficient water for flooding. Apart from that, Kadiyala et al (2015)
    established a decision support system for water-saving rice production. Their
    findings showed that up to 41% of water can be saved, while still producing 96%
    of rice yield. Xiao et al (2010) studied the moisture content and water height
    of rice field soil. They built a wireless moisture sensor that obtained a water-saving
    irrigation system of up to 65% compared to normal irrigation. Zakzouk et al (2022)
    investigated rice irrigation systems based on different features of the water
    pump, including temperature, humidity, time, and moisture. They compared three
    different machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN), decision
    tree, and random forest to assess the classification performance of the system.
    Among all the algorithms, the random forest algorithm obtained the highest classification
    accuracy of up to 99%. González Perea et al (2018) reported the application of
    irrigation water demand using a hybrid combination of different machine learning
    algorithms. The model successfully achieved an R2 of 0.72 and an RMSE of 22.2.
    Liu et al (2021) evaluated an irrigation control system using a fuzzy-programmable
    intelligence device (PID) algorithm, which reduces the regulation time by 2.5
    s. In addition, Rowshon and Amin (2010) developed a rice irrigation scheduling
    based on a geographic information system- based water management model. Regular
    monitoring of irrigation performance was performed based on ongoing water delivery
    programmes. Rashid et al (2022) assessed the feasibility of random forest model
    to determine consortium-treated wastewater for rice irrigation systems. They observed
    increasing trends in rice germination indices after irrigating with consortium-
    treated wastewater. Monitoring rice disease and growth Smart farming has demonstrated
    considerable effectives in identifying diseases and monitoring the growth of rice.
    Peng et al (2022) monitored weed detection in rice using deep learning models.
    The det-ResNet architecture was built to enhance the feature extraction of rice
    images, which obtained a mean average precision of 94%. In a similar manner, Latif
    et al (2022) employed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a deep
    learning method for rice disease detection. The results achieved the highest average
    accuracy of 96%, which can accurately classify five categories of rice disease,
    including leaf scald, leaf blast, brown spot, narrow brown spot, and bacterial
    leaf blight. Xia et al (2022) investigated the rice growth stage detection using
    a deep learning-based model. The full-resolution network model was designed with
    the highest accuracy of 0.89. Sai et al (2019) presented early detection of rice
    disease using an IoT system. Based on the findings, it was demonstrated that the
    IoT system increases field horizons by monitoring desired parameters in the cloud.
    Sowmyalakshmi et al (2021) employed an IoT system with deep learning models for
    the detection of rice disease. The CNN model was used to classify based on rice
    disease, achieving high sensitivity of 0.91. In addition, Shahidur Harun Rumy
    et al (2021) proposed the detection of rice leaf disease, including brown spot,
    leaf blast, and hispa, using image processing techniques. A random forest model
    was developed for the discrimination of rice disease with an accuracy of 97%.
    Shrivastava et al (2021) detected six types of rice disease at the early stage,
    including bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, blast, sheath rot, sheath blight,
    and false smut. The CNN-deep learning- based model was created for rice disease
    detection with the highest classification accuracy of 93%. Hanif et al (2021)
    evaluated shelf life prediction based on rice aroma using an electronic nose coupled
    with the kNN algorithm. The model achieved the best aroma prediction with an R2
    of 0.72 and an RMSE of 3.80. Kusbandhini et al (2021) determined the shelf life
    prediction of rice using an electronic nose combined with a machine learning method.
    A support vector regression algorithm was used, which obtained R2 of 0.99 and
    RMSE of 0.36, respectively. Afzal and Kasi (2019) monitored the rice farm ontology
    using an IoT system. Based on the results, the IoT system aided in making phase-wise
    decisions for rice at an early stage of crop growth. Likewise, Ramesh et al (2022)
    identified rice growth using image processing techniques. The k-means clustering
    algorithm was developed to classify rice growth with the highest classification
    rate of 100%. Asif Saleem et al (2022) investigated the detection of rice disease
    using a deep learning model. The CNN architecture was designed for the classification
    of rice disease with the highest accuracy of 89%. Venu Vasantha et al (2022) reported
    the application of a deep learning model in classifying eight different types
    of rice leaf disease. The CNN model was used for the classification of rice leaf
    disease with a testing accuracy of 98%. Furthermore, Lee et al (2022) evaluated
    rice blast detection using a feed-forward neural network model. The findings achieved
    the highest recall of 66% using input and blast occurrence datasets based on rice
    blast prediction. Singh et al (2021) studied the detection of three different
    rice diseases, including bacterial leaf blight, leaf smut, and brown spot. The
    random forest algorithm was used for rice disease classification with the highest
    accuracy of 100%. Hama et al (2021) investigated the monitoring of rice growth
    based on empirical correction using a drone, which was found to be feasible in
    mitigating the decrease in normalized difference vegetation index values. Tejaswini
    et al (2022) discussed the feasibility of deep learning method for the detection
    of rice leaf disease. The deep learning model obtained the highest accuracy of
    78% in discriminating rice leaf disease. Predicting rice quality and classification
    Through the adoption of smart farming practices in rice production, there are
    tremendous prospects for monitoring quality and classification diversity to reduce
    postharvest losses. To improve the precision of prediction and classification
    tasks in practical applications, various imaging techniques can be utilized to
    identify different types of rice. Jin et al (2022) distinguished between rice
    seed varieties using a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technique. A deep learning-
    based ResNet architecture was employed, achieving a classification accuracy of
    86% for rice seed identification. Rahimzadeh et al (2022) identified aroma rice
    using an electronic nose coupled with a fuzzy clustering algorithm. The results
    demonstrated that fuzzy clustering is feasible for determining the number of clusters
    and grouping for aromatic rice based on aroma changes. Moreover, Moses et al (2022)
    investigated damage classification in milled rice using a machine vision system.
    CNN models were developed for rice damage discrimination with an overall classification
    accuracy of 98%. Aznan et al (2021) designed an ANN model to predict rice quality,
    including colour, texture, pH, and aroma. The ANN model successfully classified
    the rice with the highest classification rate of 98%. Meanwhile, Ruslan et al
    (2022) reported the application of machine vision combined with machine learning
    methods to identify rice seed classification. Logistic regression was used based
    on the obtained rice seed images, resulting in a correct classification rate of
    92%. Garnaik et al (2022) employed a machine learning algorithm to monitor soil
    quality based on rice productivity. The random forest model was found to be feasible
    for long-term fertilizer application. Arboleda and Dizon (2022) observed rice
    seed classification by extracting colour features from healthy and unhealthy rice
    images. A Coarse Tree classifier was established for rice seed identification,
    which successfully obtained a classification rate of 100%. Zia et al (2022) integrated
    the applications of computer vision and machine learning in the identification
    of rice kernels. Seven features of rice kernels, including width, weight, length,
    chalkiness, damage, yellowness, and brokenness, were analysed, with the highest
    classification accuracy of 98%. Lu et al (2021) evaluated the prediction of potassium
    content based on the canopy hyperspectral reflectance of rice. The partial least
    squares model was used for potassium content prediction with an R2 of up to 0.76
    and an RMSE of 0.37, respectively. Almaleeh et al (2022) analyzed moisture distribution
    detection using radio frequency tomographic imaging. Regression- based machine
    learning successfully detected multiple phases of moisture distribution in rice
    with the highest accuracy of 83%. Koklu et al (2021) investigated the classification
    of five different rice varieties, including Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, Karacadag,
    and Arborio. Based on the findings, the CNN model achieved the highest classification
    of 100% for discriminate rice varieties. Erlangga et al (2021) assessed the detection
    of rice quality using an electronic nose. A neural network algorithm was developed
    to distinguish between expired and non-expired rice grains, achieving an accuracy
    score of 99%. Likewise, Aulia et al (2021) discussed the feasibility of an electronic
    nose in predicting the shelf life of rice. The gradient tree boosting machine
    learning algorithm received the highest classification accuracy of 96%. Research
    conducted by Wang et al (2022) reported the application of a gradient-weighed
    class activation mapping-based tool and CNN models in distinguishing between chalky
    and non-chalky rice grains. Azmi et al (2021) used radio frequency transceivers
    to identify the classification of moisture content in rice. The random forest
    model obtained the highest classification accuracy of 87% based on moisture content.
    Challenges of rice production in food security and sustainability Rice production
    plays a pivotal role in global food security and socio-economic development, particularly
    in Asian countries where it is a staple food for a significant portion of the
    population. However, ensuring the sustainability of rice production presents several
    challenges that need to be addressed from economic, social, and environmental
    perspectives. From an economic point of view, the profitability of rice farming
    is affected by fluctuating market prices, input costs, and limited access to credit
    and resources for small-scale farmers. Market uncertainties, trade policies, and
    competition from imported rice further compound the economic challenges. Since
    the 1980s, farmers in developed countries had access to new tools and methods
    for rice production. This has led to the development of smart farming systems
    for precisely managing rice production based on various conditions and improving
    the efficiency of input applications. In developing countries, agricultural research
    centres and institutions are currently engaged in improving smart farming applications
    for rice production. However, farmers in underdeveloped countries with limited
    resources cannot afford the technologies and techniques employed in developed
    countries. The majority of rice farmers are underprivileged, yet national policies
    in countries where rice is the main food crop typically favour consumers by regulating
    market prices for rice. Rice production does not provide farmers with a significant
    income due to rising input costs and low rice prices. Food security for rice requires
    a rigorous national policy that permits appropriate investment at every stage
    of rice production. In other words, the correct policies must be created for better
    pricing, marketing, and input availability. Despite slower growth in per capita
    rice consumption in several countries, there is a need to meet the rising demand
    for rice production which is hugely influenced by the population of a country.
    Due to the unpredictability of trade policies of the major rice exporting countries,
    maintaining stability in rice prices is a significant problem in the context of
    shock transmission. From the social perspective, it is crucial to identify several
    obstacles in terms of labour shortages, lack of advanced facilities, and conventional
    rice farming practices. Some farmers stop growing rice because there are other
    economic options available such as job opportunities in the industrial sector.
    Presently, the agricultural sector is experiencing a severe labour shortage due
    to the younger generation obtaining greater education levels and the industrial
    sector offering more enticing and promising career opportunities. Rice production
    is a vital source of income for about 140 million households involved in rice
    cultivation, such as farmers and hired labour (ESG, 2019). Due to this, the labour
    supply for rice farming operations has been reduced. Industrialization, urbanization,
    and the growth of residential areas are reducing the amount of land that can be
    used for rice farming activities. Approximately 79% of the total production cost
    per hectare in conventional rice farming is attributable to labour costs. In this
    sense, the mechanized systems and smart farming technologies are being implemented
    as there is less labour available for rice production activities. From an environmental
    perspective, rice production is associated with significant environmental impacts,
    including water scarcity, water pollution from agrochemical runoff, greenhouse
    gas emissions (particularly methane), loss of biodiversity, and deforestation.
    These environmental challenges call for sustainable farming practices that minimize
    resource use, promote climate resilience, and conserve natural ecosystems. Furthermore,
    the environment has suffered because of the intensification of rice production.
    The use of pesticides may also endanger human health and pollute waterways. Rice
    soil salinity levels in semi-arid and dry regions have increased due to intensive
    irrigation and poor drainage. This has led to nutrient depletion in rice soils
    after excessive pesticide use. Methane emissions derived from flooded rice and
    nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen fertilizers are often associated with global
    warming. On the contrary, rising ocean water, inconsistent rainfall patterns,
    and rising temperatures could also potentially influence rice production. In tropical
    climate regions, high atmospheric temperatures may reduce rice production, whereas
    variations in rainfall distribution may cause more frequent and severe floods
    and droughts. Rice is a significant contributor to food security with different
    yields according to regional differences in climatic trends. Rising temperatures
    and unpredictable rainfall have a negative impact on rice growth and development.
    A considerable decline in rainfall availability as well as irregular and strong
    rainfall patterns during the past few decades are all related to a significant
    decline in rice production (Habib-ur-Rahman et al, 2022). It will be quite challenging
    to maintain sustainable rice production considering the fact that some underprivileged
    rural populations, particularly in Asia, are facing serious climate change situations.
    The risk of climate change may jeopardize economic productivity and food security
    in the least developed countries. Overcoming these challenges requires a multi-dimensional
    approach that integrates economic incentives, social empowerment, and environmentally
    conscious farming practices. By addressing these challenges holistically, the
    rice industry can foster sustainable and resilient production systems that ensure
    economic viability, social well-being, and environmental conservation for present
    and future generations. Technical advancements and future prospects Global rice
    production has begun to show signs that may not remain constant as the 21st century
    progresses. Despite a slower pace of rice production, there are also fewer resources
    available to grow rice. There are numerous limitations and challenges to diminish
    rural hunger and poverty within rice-based production systems. Fortunately, there
    are technical ways to deal with these challenges as more than half of the world’s
    population depends on rice as their primary food source. The most viable path
    to sustainable rice production is constant productivity growth enabled by yield-enhancing
    smart farming technologies. The increased yields in environmentally sound and
    fertile cultivation areas will lessen the need to use fragile land for rice production,
    which will stop soil erosion and deforestation. In addition to reducing farmers’
    reliance on pesticides, various research projects have been conducted to create
    rice varieties that are resistant to major pests and diseases as well as to control
    natural biological agents. Global industrialization has led to a severe manpower
    shortage in the agricultural sector. It is possible to reduce reliance on labour
    and increase worker productivity by rationalizing land ownership with an emphasis
    on the adoption of innovative smart farming technologies. The majority of rice
    production tasks have been substituted by automated machinery systems and operations.
    The neglect of rice fields has also been associated with lack of resources and
    infrastructure. By establishing a corporation with supply and distribution chains,
    it is possible to improve the situation of farmers in current rice production
    schemes by assisting them in becoming self-sufficient. To preserve rice quality,
    a systematic approach related to rice control and management practices can boost
    the effectiveness of water and fertilizer usage. This will reduce the risk of
    environmental deterioration while increasing farmer profitability and reducing
    poverty. In this case, sustainable rice production is promoted to provide a sufficient
    supply of rice at affordable prices while utilizing environmental, water, and
    energy resources. Sustainable rice production strategies should take into account
    the economic, political, environmental, and social goals of each nation. The top
    priorities for sustainable rice production are international support for workable
    policies and political decision-making from national leaders. In order to achieve
    sustainability in rice production, smart farming technologies incorporated with
    the joint force from private sectors and farmer reorganizations have emerged as
    a new catalyst. Several attempts have been made to modernize rice production through
    the design of policies in order to address the issues related to rice industry.
    For instance, main improvements were rapid infrastructure expansion, enlargement
    of cultivation area through land consolidation, adoption of mechanization, subsidies,
    and the development of rice plantations. The commercialization of rice production
    has been a great success, which has shown to be profitable and attracted potential
    investors. A policy change for export and import in rice production is quite reasonable
    and has obvious implications for the shifting role of rice international markets
    in ensuring food security. It is denoted that the rice international market is
    recognized as an institutional framework for allocating resources for the efficient
    and rapid processing of information. In Malaysia, the national policy is to maintain
    a reasonable level of self-sufficiency of at least 65% because rice is regarded
    as a security commodity (Vaghefi et al, 2016). Income protection of rice farmers
    reduced reliance on external resources, and appropriate rice pricing for consumers
    are the goals of policy initiatives and interventions. In addition, another goal
    for maintaining sustainable rice production is ensuring a stable and fair rice
    supply for customers. To make rice farming economically viable and to promote
    the rice industry, the government offers subsidies by subsidizing fertilizers
    to reduce production costs. The commercial markets are allowed to determine the
    rice price based on the quality grade in order to safeguard the interests of low-income
    consumers. Policy tools targeted at controlling rice trade flows need to be managed
    carefully to avoid negative price volatility that can influence food security
    and nutrition. In the late 1980s, the primary focus of agronomic research was
    the introduction and verification of individual technologies such as herbicides,
    fertilizers, and green manures across three distinct rice growing environments:
    irrigated lowland, mangrove rice, and floating rice (Rodenburg and Saito, 2022).
    Researchers from various disciplines, including agronomists, crop modellers, physiologists,
    geographers, and hydrologists, conducted numerous studies to characterize these
    rice-growing environments, as well as inland valleys. Additionally, efforts were
    made to quantify yield gaps through comprehensive investigations. It is evident
    that policy shocks can significantly contribute to price volatility. This volatility
    can have adverse effects on farming communities, as higher yields and increased
    trade volumes may potentially lead to lower prices (Abera et al, 2019). Such price
    fluctuations can have negative implications for global food security and nutrition,
    particularly considering the substantial population reliant on rice as a major
    staple. Therefore, policy instruments aimed at regulating rice trade flows should
    be carefully managed to prevent detrimental price volatility that could impact
    food security and nutrition. Rice production programs should incorporate nutrition
    objectives to ensure that achieved gains positively influence nutrition and health
    outcomes, recognizing the crucial role that rice plays not only as a significant
    food source but also as a vital component of the livelihoods of many impoverished
    individuals worldwide. The 1980 National Agricultural Policy placed a strong emphasis
    on new land development and the consolidation of economically unviable land holdings
    (Najim et al, 2007). This policy aimed to enhance agricultural productivity while
    ensuring the long-term sustainability of the sector. In line with these policy
    objectives, Malaysia implemented a series of measures to modernize rice farming,
    beginning in the late 1960s. These transformative changes were introduced gradually
    and encompassed various aspects of rice production. The key initiatives include
    improving infrastructure, increasing the size of land parcels through consolidation,
    reorganizing individual land lots to optimize their size and shape, introducing
    mechanization, providing subsidies, and establishing rice estates. The estatization
    of rice farming, which transformed rice cultivation into a commercial enterprise,
    yielded remarkable successes. The profitability of collective farming under this
    model prompted the private sector to also invest in rice estates, further contributing
    to the sector’s growth and development. These policy-driven transformations in
    Malaysia’s rice sector were undertaken to address the challenges faced by the
    industry. By modernizing farming practices and promoting collective farming, the
    government aims to enhance productivity, improve the livelihoods of rice farmers,
    and ensure a sustainable future for the rice sector. The success of these initiatives
    demonstrated the viability and profitability of the commercial approach to rice
    farming, attracting private sector investments, and further fostering the growth
    of the rice industry in Malaysia. As a fundamental strategic item, investing in
    rural infrastructure, especially irrigation and easy access to fertilizers for
    rice production, is important since rice has a significant impact on food security.
    Given the rising demand for rice, much work needs to be done to address potential
    trade-offs for long-term sustainability. Furthermore, successful postharvest handling
    and management that reduces losses and preserves nutritional rice quality should
    be developed. New breeding techniques, such as various forms of biofortification,
    are suggested to develop new rice varieties with improved specific nutrient quality.
    There are interesting breeding techniques that can be used to improve nutrient
    content and reduce illness risks brought on by climatic variabilities, such as
    for golden rice and zinc rice. Wide-ranging rice research and breeding programmes
    are available from various institutions and organizations with the goal of creating
    climate-ready rice varieties that are more resilient to submersion, drought, heat,
    salinity, and biotic stresses. Additionally, research work on rice varieties resistant
    to salinity and drought has been developed to find ways to increase rice yields
    under these circumstances. Through genetic manipulation, genetic diversity can
    be enhanced to improve rice quality and yields. Nevertheless, these breeding methods
    should prevent the loss of other beneficial agronomic traits linked to productivity
    and disease resistance. Efforts have been exerted to effectively utilize rice
    genetic resources for long-term food security and nutrition. Climate change is
    projected to have an impact on the welfare and food security status of rice production
    because of limited land and scarce resources. Increased food insecurity in rice
    production is caused by various factors, including inadequate storage, limited
    rice operation facilities, and unfavourable environmental circumstances such as
    erosion and flooding (Ojo et al, 2022). Despite recent attention to the potentially
    major influence of climate change on rice production, the links between climate
    change and other components of food security have not yet been well investigated.
    For this reason, rice availability and nutritional value are both important factors
    that affect food security. Numerous aspects of food security must be carefully
    studied and action plans must be made in order to create an effective framework
    for sustainable rice production. Therefore, it has been suggested that in order
    to ensure the economic, social, and environmental systems working well, planned
    and proactive rice production strategies should be developed. With the global
    demand for rice on the rise, the need for sustainable rice production has become
    paramount. To address this challenge, integrating advanced technologies and data-driven
    approaches holds significant promise for the future. Precision agriculture, smart
    farming, and IoT system present opportunities to optimize the management of resources,
    refine yield estimation, enhance pest and disease control measures, and minimize
    environmental impacts. Leveraging remote sensing, drones, and satellite imagery
    can provide valuable information for monitoring and effectively managing rice
    fields, enabling more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. By embracing
    these innovative technologies, the rice industry can strive towards achieving
    higher productivity, improved resource efficiency, and reduced environmental footprints,
    thereby meeting the increasing global demand for rice while ensuring long-term
    sustainability. A significant contribution to the quest for sustainable rice production
    involves the development and adoption of climate-smart rice varieties. These specially
    bred varieties are designed to withstand various climate stresses, including drought,
    heat, and flooding while maintaining high yields and nutritional qualities. Moreover,
    the exploration of genetic engineering and biotechnology opens up new possibilities
    for enhancing desirable traits in rice, such as disease resistance and nutrient
    content. These advancements play a crucial role in promoting sustainable rice
    production. The implications of sustainable rice production extend beyond the
    agricultural realm. By embracing environmentally friendly practices like water-efficient
    irrigation systems and reduced use of agrochemicals, rice farming can actively
    contribute to conserving water resources, preserving soil health, and safeguarding
    biodiversity. Furthermore, sustainable rice production can have positive socio-economic
    impacts, particularly in the lives of small-scale farmers. It empowers women in
    agriculture, promotes inclusive and equitable value chains, and ultimately improves
    the livelihoods of those involved in rice farming. By adopting a holistic approach
    that combines scientific advancements, eco-friendly practices, and social empowerment,
    the pursuit of sustainable rice production paves the way for a more resilient,
    environmentally conscious, and socially inclusive future. Therefore, the path
    towards sustainable rice production hinges on embracing technological progress,
    fostering the development of climate-smart varieties, and adopting eco-friendly
    practices. These strategies hold great potential for boosting productivity, mitigating
    environmental consequences, and fostering socio-economic prosperity. However,
    the realization of these prospects necessitates collaborative endeavours involving
    researchers, policymakers, farmers, and other stakeholders. By uniting our efforts,
    we can establish sustainable rice production systems that safeguard food security,
    preserve the environment, and ensure the enduring socio-economic well-being of
    current and future generations. In recent decades, rice has been the most important
    crop for ensuring food security worldwide. Rice is a strategic agricultural commodity
    in terms of global trade in addition to being a significant staple food. Apart
    from that, rice farming activities have provided job opportunities for millions
    of people across the world. However, numerous challenges need to be addressed
    in the rice industry. Conventional farming techniques and low-quality rice varieties
    are the main bottlenecks, which also have a detrimental impact on global export
    production and trade share. Research and development priorities as well as the
    deployment of smart farming technologies, should time-saving, rapid, and labour-saving
    methods in response to the manual workforce and tedious operations in rice production.
    Authorities, industries, universities, and research institutions should also collaborate
    to accelerate the development of smart farming technologies and their contributions
    to agriculture. The review systematically illustrated that the technological advancements
    for sustainable rice production. It is noted that integrating smart farming approaches
    has a significant positive impact on rice productivity. The applications of smart
    farming in rice production have grown rapidly including rice yield estimation,
    smart rice irrigation systems, monitoring rice disease and growth, and predicting
    rice quality and classifications. To evaluate the potential use of smart farming
    in various operations in rice production, intensive work has been initiated. Various
    studies are being conducted to transfer this technology to the rice industry based
    on the prospective uses of smart farming. More studies are required to develop
    effective and robust algorithms since a large amount of time-series data is needed
    for solving problems in rice production. This review has successfully shown that
    advanced applications in rice production benefit from smart farming. In order
    to reap the maximum benefits of smart farming, this technology can play a major
    role in establishing sustainable rice production as well as providing social and
    environmental benefits. Thus, the technical revolution of smart farming could
    potentially be used in a real-time monitoring system for a variety of applications
    in rice production. Acknowledgement The authors wish to acknowledge the Ministry

    Chapter © 2023 1 Introduction In India, agricultural sector problems and their
    solutions affect about 80% of total population. Multiple sensors-based movable
    multifunctional robot can be used for deciding the next crop cultivation in the
    field, soil quality monitoring, crop health monitoring, and based on these data
    should be able to make intelligent decisions. Also, if more than one such robot
    will work in a swarm, then will be called as swarm robotics (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Swarm
    robotics from https://makezine.com/article/science/swarm-farming-explained/ Full
    size image Here the robots work as distributed with each robot having its own
    power and capability and also can work by coordinating among themselves. The intelligent
    swarm robotics algorithms are derived from the natural phenomenon of a bird swarm,
    fish swarm, ant swarm, etc., for carrying out any task. In the initial phase,
    the synchronization among swarm bots is to be established. In farming, the multisensory
    swarm robots are used for plowing, sprinkling fertilizers, crop monitoring, soil
    monitoring, and hence for countless applications. This paper explores the fundamental
    requirements of the users in the background research section. The work describes
    the design method followed to develop a simple, low-cost system for tracking agricultural
    environmental data through swarm robots. The second section of paper gives literature
    survey and motivation, third section discusses the objectives and problem statements,
    fourth section discusses the work flow and implementation, and fifth section discusses
    the results and final prototype model. 2 Literature Survey In [1] swarm intelligence
    and its use in swarm robotics is discussed. Due to the flexible, durable, decentralized,
    and self-organized nature of critical thinking systems, swarm robotics presents
    an exciting alternative to conventional approaches to robotics. Swarm Intelligence
    includes Control Approach, Self-assembly robots, Object clustering, swarm guided
    route, self-development, & Mechanism. In [2], the status of the current trends
    and implementation of agricultural and autonomous systems and outline of the potential
    for future applications are discussed. Three main teams of field operations are
    crop institution, plant care, and selective harvesting. The Arduino Uno, agri-bot,
    android application, and Bluetooth are some of the major characteristics of paper.
    In [3], an overview of the issues of swarm robotics and its application in various
    fields: swarm robotics advantages, swarm robotics applications, and swarm robotics
    issues are discussed. In [4], author explains how to set up a farming robot that
    can move automatically through a field while also spying on its surroundings with
    a camera and sending the information to a computer via Wi-Fi network, Arduino,
    ultrasonic sensor, agri-bot, android application, IR sensor, obstacle detection,
    IP webcam, Wi-Fi. In [5], author discusses the swarm robotics research and identifies
    precision agriculture, infrastructure inspection and maintenance, defense, space
    missions, entertainment, and precision medicine as the application fields that
    will most likely drive the science and technology of robot swarms intelligence.
    In [6], the swarm behavior of the social insects led to development of swarm robot
    technology. With the help of the sensors, we can avoid the obstacles. The prototype
    of robots consists of Arduino Uno which control unit for both main robot and follower
    robot, Arduino Uno ATMEGA328P, Transceiver pair NRF24L01, Swarm. In [7], author
    offers a thorough analysis of ground-based agricultural robotic systems, applications,
    and enabling technology, with a focus on harvesting in particular. The majority
    of work focuses on the difficulties in developing crop recognition and field navigation
    by vision. Regular tasks include weeding, seed sowing, yield calculation, water
    inspection, and health monitoring. Author discusses in [8], robotic vehicle as
    agricultural machine that uses swarm intelligence to perform tasks. In [9], an
    approach to collective robotics that takes inspiration from the self-organized
    behaviors of social animals is discussed. References [10,11,12] provide basic
    knowledge about the swarm robotic system, system-level properties, characteristics,
    mechanisms, problems, and research directions. Reference [13] gives an overview
    of recent developments in agricultural robotics, with a focus on those that use
    high-tech sensors, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and simulation environments
    for (i) targeted weed control and spraying, (ii) field scouting and data collection,
    and (iii) automated harvesting. [14] describes the use of this robotic system
    as one of the significant advancements in this generation of robotics and how
    it will revolutionize the farming industry. The major focus of this summary is
    on how this fully autonomous system is used for tasks like harvesting, watering,
    scouting, and plowing. In [15], the following is an author’s discussion of swarm
    robotics. Swarm intelligence and robotics are the sources of inspiration for the
    relatively new field of swarm robotics. It results from the integration of multi
    robotics with swarm intelligence approaches. Despite numerous planned studies,
    there is still a long way to go before they may be used in real life. An overview
    of swarm robotics is provided in the current study to help readers comprehend
    this multi-robot domain research and to make clear the broad themes that are being
    addressed in this area. The sections offered in this paper might easily direct
    those who are just starting to get interested in this area, i.e., swarm robotics
    applications, simulators, and classification of swarm robotics issues. 2.1 Motivation
    The study of swarm robotics focuses on how many physically embodied agents can
    be produced, and how this may be done in a way that a desired collective action
    emerges from the local interactions of the agents and their environment. The operation
    of a swarm robotic system should exhibit three functional properties. Robustness—A
    number of factors is responsible for the robustness of the operation. First, the
    absence of one robot may be promptly replaced by another. Second, because there
    are many different parts of the robot working together, it is unlikely that one
    of them would stop working. Third, all swarms are rather straightforward, which
    lessens the likelihood that they will fail. Fourth, the swarm is resilient to
    local environmental disturbances because sensing is dispersed across it. Flexibility—It
    helps the system to tackle different problems with the coordination of an individual
    swarm. With this property, the swarm robotic system works very fast to carry large
    prey through the utilization of different coordination strategies. Scalability—The
    robot should be able to handle a variety of group sizes and carry a sizable number
    of individuals without interfering with other operations. This refers to the coordination
    techniques and processes that must be created for swarm systems to guarantee swarm
    operation at various swarm sizes. 2.2 Features Task enablement: Multiple robots
    can do certain tasks that are impossible for the single robot. Improved performance:
    If tasks can be decomposable, then by using parallelism, groups of robots can
    make tasks to be performed more efficiently. Fault tolerance: Under certain conditions,
    the failure of a single robot within a group does not imply that the given task
    cannot be accomplished, thanks to other one. Distributed action: The group of
    robots can actuate in various places at the same time. Communication: The robots
    have to support wireless communication which helps to avoid the plugging cables
    to the robots. Physical interaction: The robots should be able to physically interact
    with each other and the environment for self-assembly construction. 3 Problem
    Statement Farmers are seeking for ways to lessen their burden and improve the
    productivity of their fields. Data gathering is the main force behind the need
    for labor. In order to make well-informed decisions that will increase the productivity
    of their farm, farmers require data. Our project is built on the work of a previous
    MQP team to develop an IOT SWARM (stands for self-assembling wireless autonomous
    reconfigurable modules) agriculture system that would allow farmers to monitor
    environmental conditions in their fields with sensor nodes and manage and maintain
    the nodes using autonomous rovers. This system would deal with the socioeconomic
    difficulties that farmers have. The battery-powered nodes measure the following
    variables to provide data on the agronomic conditions in the fields: temperature,
    humidity, light intensity, and air quality. Farmers would be able to evaluate
    the state of their farms precisely and affordably. It supports the farmer’s ability
    to keep an eye on field conditions and make well-informed decisions to boost output,
    cut expenses, and preserve the environment. 3.1 Objectives To develop four robots
    in swarm architecture for precision agriculture. To use the swarm robots in the
    field for obtaining plow, irrigation, seed sowing, harvesting, and soil moistening.
    Based on the data available on one synchronizing BOT, apply intelligent algorithms
    for appropriate action. Swarm robotics implies that the instructions we provide
    to the one robot will be followed by the other robots. We have four robots in
    our project in distributed architecture. 3.2 Model Implementation The proposed
    swarm robotic design, the robots of the swarm should be autonomous bodies to sense
    the field and should be able to send the data to the server. The autonomous robot
    must coordinate and collaborate to complete the task efficiently like soil monitoring
    and irrigation, or harvesting a field, etc. The design of single robot for precision
    agriculture is shown as in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 Circuit diagram of robot Full
    size image Fig. 3 Prototype model of multisensory multifunctional robot Full size
    image 3.3 Process of Monitoring Temperature Start the application. Connect the
    one and slave robots with the cloud where readings are visible. If the temperature
    is below 10 ℃, then seed fails to grow, we need to turn ON the water pump and
    when above 10 ℃ it turns OFF. If the temperature is in between 20 and 32 ℃ the
    crop will grow, so we need to plow the field after turning it OFF and seeding
    ON in the field. If the temperature is more than 32 ℃ in the field, then the crop
    needs some amount of water, so turn ON the water pump and give sufficient water
    to the crop. If the temperature is remaining more than 32 ℃ the crop is damaged
    and harvesting cutter is ON to remove the damaged crop from the field. Store the
    data automatically on cloud. Stop the app and shows the result on cloud. 3.4 Monitoring
    Soil Moisture Start the Blynk Application. Connect the robots to the Blynk or
    cloud. Now, robot starts working and soil moisture data reading shows on Blynk
    app. If the soil moisture of field is below 30% then crop does not grow or becomes
    damage, crop field needs water, so pump is ON and OFF after pumping when the soil
    moisture is up to 30%. If the soil moisture of the crop is in between, it remains
    30–50%, then crop grows faster after that harvesting cutter is ON for cutting
    the crop. If the soil moisture is more than 50% crop is damaged, then harvesting
    cutter is ON and OFF after a time to cutting damage crop. Stop the Blynk application
    after sensing soil moisture in the whole field and store the data on cloud. Blynk
    cloud shows the data of the fields on mobile screen or presenting all data of
    soil moisture in excel sheet format in percentage. 3.5 Plow We use a stand for
    plow or that stands are also called a type of thing for plowing the field. It
    is connected through the servo motor which is connected through the motor and
    controlled by the Arduino. When we give or press the plow button ON then the one
    robot starts to plow after some nano seconds, other slave robots take this command
    to the same function. We use servomotor for take up and down plow stand. 3.6 Seeding
    In this function, we use a servo motor (2), we call servo motor 2 which is used
    for seeding function. This servo motor is also connected to motor driver to drive
    this motor. Use servo motor for seeding purpose, the box is rotated in up and
    down direction. We press seed ON button in Blynk App then Arduino shows this operation.
    3.7 Temperature and Soil Moisture Sensing We use temperature and soil moisture
    sensor to check the quality of crop. These sensors are connected to servo motor
    which is derived by motor drive or performed by Arduino. This servo motor is connected
    from motor driver which drives the direction of sensor up and down. We press ON
    button of the temperature or soil moisture sensor, then it performs the operation
    and stores the reading in the Blynk App. 3.8 Water Pumping We use water pump that
    is connected through Arduino or motor driver for water pumping in the field. When
    we give command through Blynk App then Arduino performs the task. As, we press
    pump button ON, the irrigation starts and if we again press the same button, then
    pump is OFF. 3.9 Harvesting We use DC geared motor which is connected through
    motor driver. We can connect a blade on DC geared motor for cutting the crops.
    When we push ON button of cutter on the Blynk App then Arduino takes command and
    performs this operation. After completing this task, we press OFF button to stop
    harvesting process. 3.10 Humidity Sensing We use DHT sensor for sensing the humidity.
    When we press ON button for humidity sensing, it starts sensing. This sensor is
    connected through Arduino. Arduino UNO performs this operation wisely. It takes
    reading of humidity and stores in Blynk App from where it appears on the mobile
    screen. After sensing the humidity, we press OFF button to stop the operation.
    4 Working of SWARM Agriculture System Firstly, we download Blynk application from
    Play Store in mobile. Make necessary configuration using SSID network and password
    and make a layout of remote and provide ON and OFF buttons with operation name
    and direction buttons. Then connect the One Robot first using the SPOT network
    to control the movements. In the One Robot we have the uses, node MCU, RF module,
    servo motor, DC geared motors, Arduino UNO board, motor drivers, step down buck
    converter and OP Amp for soil moisture sensors. The same components are used for
    the other three slave robots. Firstly, upload the required code in node MCU and
    now connect the RF transmitter with the node MCU. Using Radio Frequency module
    (RF module), we can transmit and receive the radio signal between two devices
    or even more than two devices that maintains the coordination between robots and
    to provide the communication between remote control and actual robots. Then node
    MCU ESP: 8266 has Wi-Fi module that can be connected to our smartphone/smart devices
    by using Blynk Application which is a big IOT platform and it helps to control
    the robots remotely. Then Arduino UNO board is connected with node MCU as well
    as RF transmitter in the One Robot and RF receiver in the slave robots. It is
    used to control robot motors and sensors by using embedded C programming in the
    Arduino UNO board. The motor board controls the motors and stores the reading
    and decides how to operate all robots. The whole process is controlled by a microcontroller.
    Then we use two motor drivers in the one robot or other slave robots to control
    all the motors and maintain speed and direction at the same time according to
    Arduino coding In one robot and slave robots, we have used three servo motors
    and four DC geared motors, DC geared motors are capable of high starting torque.
    We have used two sensors, DTH (for measuring the temperature and humidity) and
    soil moisture sensor (for measuring the moisture of the soil). OP Amp for soil
    moisture sensor is used in one robot or slave robots to convert the incoming analog
    signal from soil probe to digital. Step down buck converter is used to maintain
    power supply of 3A and voltage of motors. Then operations are performed by the
    one robot and slave robots—harvesting, pumping, soil moisture sensing, seeding,
    plowing, temperature, and humidity sensing. In our project we have four robots,
    one robot is used for sending the data to server and issuing commands to other
    three robots, swarm robotics means the instruction we give to the one robot will
    be followed by other robot (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Proposed swarm robotics design for
    agriculture Full size image 5 Workflow of the Prototype Model See Fig. 5. Fig.
    5 Flowchart Full size image 6 Results The objective of this work was to design
    the swarm robotic system for agriculture. This system works well with three slave
    robots and one robot in the field. Due to the parallel operation of numerous robots
    and their cooperation, the application of swarm intelligence principles to agricultural
    robotics has the potential to result in innovation. The one robot gets the sensing
    parameters from slave robots visiting and monitoring the field. On receiving the
    data, the one robot issues commands to slave robot for seeding, harvesting, and
    irrigation. The datasheet mentioned below has shown the reading of temperature
    and soil moisture which helps to operate the various operations like plowing,
    seeding, water pumping, and harvesting. It performs all the functions and gives
    the result accordingly. It starts with one robot then followed by other three
    slave robots as far as the process goes on, in the field. The fully developed
    robots are shown in Fig. 6 (Table 1). Fig. 6 a Multisensory multifunctional robots

    robot that can mow, seed, plow, and sprinkle water has been successfully tested
    and implemented. The key conclusion of this study is that the majority of these
    self-government-supporting frameworks are more adaptable than traditional frameworks.
    Multifunctional horticulture robot advantages include a decrease of human involvement,
    assurance of a sufficient water supply, and effective resource use. In the future,
    similar activities will be completed without the need for a human supervisor due
    to the use of ultrasonic sensors and cameras to monitor things like soil quality,
    the area the robot is guarding, and leveling. The data collected from the robots
    for different parameters will be uploaded on the cloud for different applications.
    Commands will be issued by One Robot for the respective function. Also the data
    collected on the server will be analyzed using machine learning for intelligent
    decisions regarding soil quality, fertilizers requirement, harvesting of crop,
    irrigation, etc. So the system will be smart in future with further application
    of machine learning algorithms. References Kharje S, Wahaj SM, Fatma SS, Prof.

    prominent contributors include Griffith University, Politecnico di Milano, and
    the Università degli Studi di Salerno. Regarding worldwide research trends, an
    examination of distinct clusters defined by their principal keywords was conducted.
    The following clusters were identified in order of significance based on the number
    of publications: Urban Water Meters, IoT Connection, Communication and Security,
    Grid Management, Water Networks, Hot Water, Groundwater Monitoring, and Smart
    Irrigation. Of particular note is the growing use of machine learning applications,
    especially in the management of distribution networks. This trend opens up a promising
    avenue for addressing complex problems in real time. Keywords: smart metering;
    urban infrastructure; water conservation; energy management; data analytics; sustainable
    resource management 1. Introduction Concerns about water supply and quality have
    been a constant focus in human development. Currently, especially in developed
    countries, there is a significant emphasis on the sanitary and overall quality
    aspects of water. Various regulations establish the criteria to be followed in
    water supply [1]. The consumption of water on our planet has tripled in the 20th
    century, attributed to factors such as continuous population growth, water poverty,
    poor management, and outdated or inadequate facilities, contributing to a global
    water crisis. Consequently, water resources are becoming increasingly expensive
    and scarce, fueling a strong interest in their effective control and efficient
    use. Across various sectors, from industry to agriculture, extensive efforts are
    being made to monitor water distribution networks [2]. To address this significant
    challenge, distribution networks need to become more efficient by reducing losses,
    and consumers must also play a role in decreasing their water consumption. In
    the energy sector, studies and actions have already been undertaken to enhance
    the functioning of related facilities [3]. The substantial user base leads to
    a continuously rising water consumption, necessitating precise control mechanisms,
    despite the high costs associated with installing multiple monitoring instruments
    and their corresponding actuators [4]. Measurement devices often malfunction,
    leading to interventions based on lower-quality data. While studies on urban water
    consumption in broad areas have been conducted [5], research on specific buildings
    is scarce. For individual buildings, the LEED certification (Leadership in Energy
    and Environmental Design) is frequently employed, sought after by many businesses
    in their business plans [6]. Consumption signatures are used to identify the individual
    consumption of each device [7], enabling the identification of more complex consumption
    patterns. Such algorithms have successfully been applied in public buildings for
    energy use rationalization [8]. The role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in water
    supply chain management is crucial for understanding the future trajectory at
    the intersection of computer science and resource management [9]. Actuators play
    a vital role in enabling the automation of various smart city services [10]. The
    primary goal of this study is to scrutinize the entire body of scientific literature
    pertaining to smart water meters on a global scale, emphasizing the significance
    of understanding research trends in this domain. 2. Materials and Methods This
    bibliometric study utilized Scopus databases as the primary source for data retrieval.
    Despite Scopus containing historical content dating back to 1788, the search was
    restricted to the period between 2000 and 2022. The research methodology encompasses
    a comprehensive approach involving data collection, preprocessing, and multifaceted
    analysis to unveil and comprehend scientific communities and their collaborative
    patterns, see Figure 1. Figure 1. Methodology. In the initial phase, scholarly
    publications and their associated metadata were retrieved from the globally recognized
    Scopus database. The Scopus API was leveraged to conduct a targeted search focused
    on documents related to smart water meters, aligning with established research
    methodologies [11]. The search query employed was as follows: TITLE-ABS-KEY (smart*
    AND (water* OR flow*) AND meter*). All documents were downloaded from Scopus leading
    to the annotated search. Crafted to cover a broad spectrum of literature, the
    query specifically addressed terms related to “smart water meter” or “smart flow
    meter” and their practical applications across various communities. However, the
    methodology introduced in this study effectively manages this potential issue,
    thanks to the resulting network graph’s structure and which can be visualized
    with the Gephi (open-source tool). After acquiring the raw dataset, a preprocessing
    phase ensued, employing Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine for basic data organization
    and cleansing. This ensured that the dataset was primed for advanced analysis.
    For the core analysis, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, capitalizing on
    its robust capabilities in statistical analysis and data visualization. The data
    underwent refinement to eliminate documents lacking meaningful connections within
    the main body of scientific literature. This curation process allowed this research
    to focus specifically on the most pertinent documents and their relationships.
    For the primary screening, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, taking advantage
    of its robust statistical analysis and data visualization capabilities. The dataset
    was subjected to a filtering process to eliminate documents that did not establish
    any connection with the rest of the documents. This filtering allowed us to focus
    the cluster analysis on the most relevant documents and their associations. For
    this purpose, we employed a community detection algorithm based on modularity
    in large networks, as detailed in [12]. Specifically, Gephi’s algorithm used Louvain’s
    method, a widely accepted approach for community detection. Louvain’s method is
    optimized for large networks, with the goal of identifying modular structures
    by maximizing a modularity score within the range of −0.5 to 1. This score evaluates
    the density of edges within clusters compared to those between clusters. The Louvain
    method was chosen because of its computational efficiency and its ability to delineate
    clear structures in intricate datasets. Although alternative algorithms such as
    Girvan–Newman, Infomap, and Label Propagation were considered, they proved less
    suitable due to their computational intensity, limited relevance to citation networks,
    or production of less cohesive structures, respectively. For the sorting by year,
    by subject category, and by country, these data are obtained directly from the
    Scopus search in the results analysis section of the website itself. It is possible
    to export them in CSV format. Later, year and subject category data were imported
    and represented using Excel. Country data have been mapped with QGIS software
    3.28. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis will be undertaken to delve into the
    evolution of publications over the years. This includes a meticulous examination
    of the countries and affiliations that make the most substantial contributions
    to this scientific field. Additionally, this study will focus on dissecting the
    key words employed in the articles, aiming to discern the scientific communities
    within which these works can be categorized. The overarching aim is to provide
    a comprehensive and insightful overview of the landscape of smart water meter
    research. 3. Results 3.1. Evolution Trend The evolution of published articles

    is a gradual increase in the number of publications, with a significant spike
    in 2010, where the count jumps to 85. This suggests a growing interest in and
    focus on the subject during that period. The most substantial growth occurs in
    the subsequent years, particularly from 2011 to 2019, with a remarkable surge
    in publications. The year 2019 stands out with 281 articles, reflecting a substantial

    research, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the varied
    priorities within the academic community. Cluster 1, identified as Urban Water
    Meters, stands out as the most significant in terms of size. Table 4 outlines
    the frequency (N) of occurrences of primary keywords associated with this cluster.
    It is noteworthy that this cluster leads in 18 out of the 20 main keywords, indicating
    a higher concentration of these terms within this community compared to others.
    In fact, eight of the 20 main keywords, such as Residential Water and Water Efficiency,
    are exclusive to this cluster. Over the past two decades, more or less detailed
    measurement programs, referred to as smart measures, have been developed [13].
    This progress has led to nearly continuous monitoring of water consumption. The
    abundance of available data has prompted the exploration of strategies for modeling
    and managing water in residential areas [14]. Periodic resource scarcity drives
    interest in limiting and controlling losses; leading studies toward water, notably
    by Rahim et al. [15], demand planning, socio-economic analysis, behavioral analysis,
    classification of water-related events, and user feedback. The cluster’s connection
    with information technology is evident, sharing techniques with other supply systems
    such as electricity or gas [16]. These meters enable the identification of the
    final use of water, a crucial aspect for making utility predictions [17]. The
    technology has matured sufficiently to transition from pilot trials to real-world
    implementation in large supply networks [18] and urban supply planning, closely
    intertwined with city planning itself [19]. Additionally, the current analyses
    aim to disaggregate data to reach individual events [20]. Reengineering of existing
    systems can be undertaken in light of the results already achieved [21]. Cluster
    2, denoted as IOT Connection, forms a community centered on Internet of Things
    (IoT) connection algorithms and network implementation. Ranking as the second-largest
    community, Table 4 details the frequency (N) of primary keywords associated with
    this cluster, establishing connections with the Urban Water metering and Communication
    and Security communities, while maintaining ties with the Energy consumption cluster.
    Among its 20 main keywords, 12 are intrinsic to this cluster, and it holds significance
    as the leading community in 8 of them. Its primary associations lie with Clusters
    1, 3, and 4, positioning it as a substantial and interconnected family with promising
    prospects for future development. Current meters are acknowledged for their sluggishness
    and time-intensive nature, promoting water wastage, thus advocating for the adoption
    of smart meters to enhance resource conservation and early fault detection [22,23].
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) architectures are anticipated to facilitate
    the integration of multiple networks simultaneously [24], aiming for user interaction
    [25]. The configuration of networks through smart water meters (SWM) and the advantageous
    use of IoT are highlighted in literature [26]. Case studies explore innovative
    applications, such as using pumps as generators or direct interaction with users
    [27], aligning with user interest in these devices [28]. Efficient data transmission
    mechanisms within the network involve relaying data from each node to the nearest
    node [29]. Two critical aspects, namely sensor network energy consumption and
    security issues, are underscored in the literature [30], emphasizing the multifaceted
    nature of research within the IOT Connection cluster. Cluster 3 was identified
    as Communication and Security and stands as the third-largest community. Table
    4 delineates the frequency (N) of principal keywords associated with this cluster,
    which revolves around communication and security aspects in network meters, particularly
    emphasizing energy meters. Remarkably, it encapsulates the top 10 keywords among
    the first 20 across all clusters, asserting its significance in this domain. In
    half of these 20 keywords, this community holds the utmost importance, while in
    the remaining 10, it shares keywords with other communities, primarily with Clusters
    1 and 3. This community is predominantly concerned with communication protocols
    and applications of automatic meters, with a focus on reducing peak consumption,
    a growingly attractive topic [31]. Traditional systems, effective thus far in
    electricity and water distribution, are deemed insecure and lacking user feedback
    capabilities [32]. Smart energy meters can be leveraged to monitor other types
    of meters, integrated into networks [33,34]. The computerized control of these
    networks [35] presents a challenge in terms of vulnerability to intrusions [36],
    necessitating resolution in future developments [37]. Data aggregation allows
    for processing while maintaining user privacy [38]. The Communication and Security
    cluster, thus, contributes significantly to the exploration of secure and effective
    communication protocols in smart metering systems. Cluster 4 was identified as
    Grid Management. Table 5 provides an overview of the primary keywords associated
    with this cluster. Positioned as a peripheral cluster, it primarily addresses
    the challenges in managing vast amounts of grid data. Although it shares keywords
    with other communities, it assumes a leading role in what is termed Big Data,
    highlighting its auxiliary nature in supporting other fields. This specialized
    community focuses on the implementation of intelligent algorithms for information
    acquisition, data processing, and swift action in extensive supply networks, predominantly
    in energy but extending to other domains such as water or gas [39,40,41]. The
    characterization of overall consumption holds a prominent place in this cluster,
    particularly in the context of water, leveraging time series [42] or neural networks
    [43]. Grid Management emerges as a crucial contributor to the application of intelligent
    algorithms for efficient data management and consumption characterization in large-scale
    supply networks. Cluster 5, labelled as Water Network Partitioning, is outlined
    in Table 5, featuring the primary keywords associated with this cluster. Characterized
    as an isolated cluster, it addresses the challenges of metering an extensive network
    through the analysis of smaller network components. Despite being a smaller cluster,
    it holds significance, representing 1.97% of the keywords. Within this group,
    all authors are closely interconnected, collaborating on a specific strategy for
    distribution network analysis. This strategy involves studying reduced sectors
    of the network to simplify the analysis [44,45,46]. The methodology employed includes
    the installation of valves and smart meters on main lines, accompanied by the
    development of specialized software for these meters, referred to as SWAM [47,48].
    This technique has been applied in fault detection and pollution control [49]
    through recursive sectorization [50]. The Water Network Partitioning cluster,
    although smaller in size, plays a vital role in the exploration of innovative
    strategies for network analysis, particularly in the context of simplifying analysis
    through the study of smaller network components. Cluster 6 focuses on Water Heating
    and the associated metering of this valuable resource, as detailed in Table 5
    with the primary keywords for this cluster. Comprising 1.13% of the keywords,
    this well-defined community primarily interacts with Cluster 1. The majority of
    the keywords within this family are unique to it, although none stands out as
    particularly abundant. The substantial cost of this resource amplifies the significance
    of this family, as highlighted by Bacher et al. [51]. The research within this
    cluster involves the development of prediction models for resource needs, particularly
    emphasizing scenarios in cold climates [52]. Detection of leaks is of particular
    importance due to the high energy costs [53]. This family extends its exploration
    to related networks such as domestic heat and gas, demonstrating a comprehensive
    approach to resource management [54,55]. The Water Heating and metering cluster,
    while relatively small, delves into crucial aspects of resource prediction, environmental
    considerations, and the efficient management of expensive resources. The remaining
    clusters are of limited size but represent emerging sectors with promising prospects
    for future studies. Cluster 7 is a small cluster centered on Groundwater Monitoring,
    utilizing various approaches. It occupies a peripheral position in the diagram
    and is related to Cluster 1, accounting for 0.99% of the keywords. Similar to
    Cluster 8, the majority of the keywords within this group are specific to it,
    sharing few words with other clusters. Table 6 lists the most representative keywords
    for this cluster. Water crisis and the threat of resource shortage are identified
    as direct consequences of factors such as limited precipitation, traditional irrigation
    methods, and inefficient monitoring and control systems in agriculture [56]. This
    cluster serves as a unique case within monitoring, often supported by simulation
    models [57,58,59]. It places special emphasis on control elements and leverages
    other components, such as energy meters, to enhance information completeness [60].
    Additionally, Cluster 7 connects with the use of unconventional water sources,
    such as desalinated water for urban use and reclaimed water for agricultural purposes
    [61]. Cluster 8, also a small cluster, is dedicated to Smart Irrigation control,
    representing 0.85% of the keywords. This group features highly specific keywords,
    occasionally shared with Cluster 1 and Cluster 3. Table 6 displays the most representative
    keywords for this cluster. Focused on intelligent control of irrigation systems
    to promote water savings and efficiency [62], this cluster emphasizes user satisfaction
    as a crucial parameter [63]. Initially applied in residential landscaping [62,63],
    smart irrigation is currently being implemented in agricultural areas [64,65,66].
    This family exhibits significant development potential, with numerous sensors
    of this type being deployed in agricultural areas [67]. In the analysis, two clusters
    with minimal representation emerge—one focused on data acquisition, sensors, and
    pattern recognition of consumption. For instance, Grigoras et al. [68] present
    an innovative solution in the form of a software platform for sustainable water
    supply system management. This platform incorporates advanced ICT solutions, including
    Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence, along with smart concepts such as smart
    metering and demand response, offering benefits to both the energy and water sectors.
    Additionally, there is another cluster specialized in automated decision making,
    utilizing learning programs, decision support programs, etc. [69,70]. 5. Discussion
    The analysis of the clusters reveals several challenges and prospects in smart
    water meter research. One key challenge lies in the need for more extensive exploration
    and development of clusters related to emerging sectors, such as Groundwater Monitoring
    and Smart Irrigation Control. These clusters, though relatively small, represent
    critical areas of study with promising potential for future research. The challenge
    is to further investigate and expand these clusters to gain a comprehensive understanding
    of their applications and implications for water resource management. Another
    challenge is the integration of various clusters, particularly those related to
    Communication and Security (Cluster 3) and Grid Management (Cluster 4). As smart
    water metering systems become more sophisticated, addressing the communication
    protocols, security vulnerabilities, and efficient management of vast amounts
    of data in the grid becomes crucial. Integrating findings from these clusters
    can contribute to the development of comprehensive and secure smart water networks.
    On the positive side, the clusters also offer promising prospects. For instance,
    the increasing focus on Smart Irrigation Control (Cluster 8) indicates a growing
    interest in water conservation and efficient agricultural practices, as recent
    studies indicate [71]. This cluster’s emphasis on user satisfaction and its potential
    application in agricultural areas signal a positive trend toward sustainable water
    use in farming. Additionally, the intersection of Water Network Partitioning (Cluster
    5) with unconventional water sources like desalinated water and reclaimed water
    opens up opportunities for diversifying water supply strategies. Exploring innovative
    approaches to network analysis and water source utilization can contribute to
    more resilient and sustainable water supply systems. It is worth noting the increasing
    use of machine learning applications, especially in the management of distribution
    networks. This trend opens up a promising avenue for addressing complex problems
    in real time [72]. So, the challenges lie in further exploring and integrating
    emerging clusters, while the prospects include advancements in smart irrigation,
    secure communication protocols, and diversified water supply strategies, ultimately
    contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable smart water
    metering systems. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, the analysis of smart water metering

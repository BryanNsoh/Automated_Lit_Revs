    PDF 1 Introduction Food security is a crucial global problem affecting billions
    of people worldwide. Food security is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation
    of the United Nations (FAO) as “when all people, at all times, have physical,
    social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their
    dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (Cudjoe et
    al. 2021). Despite tremendous improvements in recent decades, food security remains
    a key concern, especially in developing nations and among vulnerable people (Keesstra
    et al. 2016). The world’s population continues to rise, placing enormous strain
    on agricultural systems to produce enough food to feed everyone effectively. Weather
    patterns that are erratic, severe occurrences, and changing climatic circumstances
    significantly influence agricultural production, resulting in crop failures, lower
    yields, and food shortages (Nathan and Joel Uche 2023; Oseni and Masarirambi 2011).
    Soil erosion, deforestation, and degradation of arable land endanger agricultural
    production and restrict cultivable land availability. Water shortage in many locations
    impedes irrigation and farming practices, resulting in water stress and lower
    crop yields. Much of the world’s food supply is lost or squandered at different
    points throughout the supply chain, from production to consumption, aggravating
    food poverty (Khanna, 2018). Sustainable agriculture is an important strategy
    for addressing global food security concerns while minimizing negative environmental
    consequences. Sustainable agriculture seeks to increase production, protect natural
    resources, promote ecological balance, and assure farmers’ economic viability
    (Herzberg et al. 2022). It entails putting practices that promote long-term food
    production in place while neither depleting resources nor damaging the environment
    (Abubakar 2021). The AIoT has emerged as a disruptive technology with enormous
    promise to revolutionise the agriculture industry in recent years. The AIoT is
    a network of networked devices with sensors, software, and data analytics capabilities
    that gather and share data via the Internet. AIoT may be used in agriculture to
    monitor and manage different elements of farming, such as crop health, irrigation,
    pest control, and animal management (Saad et al. 2023). Furthermore, recision
    farming is made possible by AIoT-enabled sensors and data analytics, which allow
    farmers to monitor and optimise inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides,
    resulting in higher efficiency and decreased resource waste (Giuffrida et al.
    2022). Weather forecasting and monitoring powered by AIoT assist farmers in adapting
    to changing weather patterns, mitigating risks, and making educated crop management
    choices. AIoT enables farmers to monitor their crops and animals from afar remotely,
    increasing output and minimising the requirement for personal presence (Kemmoe
    et al. 2022). AIoT applications in the food supply chain increase traceability,
    minimize food loss, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. AIoT technologies
    improve efficiency and solve problems in agriculture and food supply systems.
    Food security and sustainable agriculture need precision farming, smart irrigation,
    livestock monitoring, supply chain traceability, climate resilience, data-driven
    decision-making, and sustainable resource management (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022).
    The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015
    to address worldwide social, economic, and environmental challenges. These 17
    global objectives provide a comprehensive framework for promoting sustainable
    development and improving people’s well-being. They cover various issues such
    as poverty eradication, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water,
    sanitation, affordable energy, decent work, industry, innovation, climate action,
    life below water, life on land, peace and justice, and strong institutions (Kalu
    et al. 2021). The SDGs emphasize collaboration among governments, businesses,
    civil society, and individuals to achieve sustainable development. By 2030, the
    SDGs aim to end poverty, hunger, inequality, access to quality education and healthcare,
    promote sustainable economic growth, combat climate change, and protect biodiversity
    (Erin and Bamigboye 2022). Implementing the SDGs requires political commitment,
    adequate resources, and effective policies. Governments play a crucial role in
    setting national priorities, aligning policies with the SDGs, and mobilizing financial
    resources. Businesses are encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, invest in
    innovation, and contribute to the achievement of the goals (Khan et al. 2022).
    In conclusion, the SDGs represent a global roadmap for creating a more sustainable
    and equitable future for all, addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality,
    and environmental degradation. Achieving the SDGs requires collective efforts
    and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. The study’s research goal is
    to look at the role of AIoT in promoting sustainable agriculture and tackling
    food security issues. The research will examine the possible advantages and drawbacks
    of AIoT applications in agriculture, such as crop management, water conservation,
    animal monitoring, and supply chain management. The study will thoroughly examine
    current literature, case studies, and real-world deployments of AIoT solutions
    in agriculture. It will concentrate on the influence of AIoT on agricultural production,
    resource efficiency, and climate change resistance. In addition, the research
    will look at the problems and hurdles to AIoT adoption in agriculture, policy
    implications, and future trends. Overall, this study aims to improve knowledge
    of how AIoT may play an important role in promoting sustainable agriculture and
    maintaining food security in a fast-changing world. The study seeks to give significant
    insights for policymakers, academics, and stakeholders to make informed choices
    and build strategies for sustainable agricultural growth by highlighting the prospects
    and difficulties of AIoT adoption in agriculture. This chapter is arranged into
    nine different sections. In Sect. 2, the related works are discussed in detail.
    The research on AIoT applications in sustainable agriculture is presented in detail
    in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides a discussion on AIoT in food supply chain management.
    Section 5 provides the challenges and barriers. Section 6 discusses the policy
    and regulatory considerations. Section 7 provides the Case Studies and real-world
    implementations as well as future trends and innovations are provided in Sect.
    8. Finally, Sect. 9 concludes the study. 2 Literature Review Climate change, water
    shortages, and the need for effective resource management are just a few of the
    many obstacles that agriculture must overcome to ensure the world''s food supply.
    The AIoT has emerged as a potent tool to overcome these obstacles and improve
    agriculture’s long-term viability (Praveen et al. 2021). AIoT systems use sensors,
    data analytics, and real-time connectivity to monitor and optimize agricultural
    operations for higher yields, lower resource waste, and safer food supplies (Nwankwoala
    and Okujagu 2021). This section examines current AIoT technologies for sustainable
    agriculture and food security. Using sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature,
    nutrient levels, and crop health is at the heart of precision farming, a prominent
    use in agriculture. More informed choices about watering, fertilizing, and controlling
    pests may be made by farmers thanks to this information (Sohel et al. 2022). With
    real-time data from weather stations and soil moisture sensors, AIoT-enabled smart
    irrigation systems can fine-tune watering schedules to meet the precise needs
    of individual crops. These methods help farmers save water and irrigate their
    crops more efficiently, especially in arid areas (Farooq et al. 2022). AIoT devices
    with sensors and GPS may track cattle and monitor their well-being and habits.
    Better livestock management and greater food production result from using livestock
    monitoring tools that assist farmers in identifying health problems early, optimizing
    feeding patterns and enhancing breeding practices (Eze et al. 2022). Due to AIoT-based
    supply chain traceability systems, food goods may be tracked and monitored in
    real-time through the supply chain. These methods improve visibility and tracking,
    safeguarding against food fraud and keeping consumers secure (Farooq et al. 2022;
    Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Weather patterns, temperature, and humidity data are
    gathered via AIoT-based weather stations and environmental sensors, which are
    then used for climate monitoring and prediction (Al-otaibi 2022). This information
    is utilized to foresee the effects of climate change and harsh weather on crops,
    allowing farmers to make necessary preparations in advance. To keep tabs on pest
    populations in farms, AIoT systems have integrated pest monitoring sensors and
    data analytics. As stated by (Zhao et al. 2022), pests may be managed more sustainably
    and with less reliance on chemical pesticides if their presence is identified
    sufficiently soon. Automated and optimized nutrition and water management is achieved
    via integrating AIoT technology into aquaponics and hydroponics systems. These
    methods allow for year-round farming, reduce water use, and boost the long-term
    viability of fish and vegetable harvests (Yoon 2020). Data on crop health and
    stress may be gathered in real-time via remote sensing technologies like satellites
    and drones fitted with AIoT sensors. This data aids farmers in making early diagnoses
    of disease and nutritional deficits, which leads to more focused treatments and
    fewer crop failures (Abdullahi et al. 2022). AIoT technologies use automated traps,
    drones, and AI for smart pest control (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). This allows for
    precise monitoring and managing of pest populations without harming the ecosystem.
    Indicators of soil health, such as pH, nutrient content, and organic matter, are
    tracked using AIoT sensors and devices. Producing crops sustainably and effectively
    requires this information to implement precision agricultural practices and enhance
    soil fertility (Mishra and Pandya 2021). As a result of optimizing resource utilization,
    increasing productivity, and raising the efficiency of food supply chains, AIoT
    technologies have the potential to revolutionize agriculture and solve food security
    concerns. Current AIoT solutions show how important technology is to attaining
    sustainable agriculture and meeting the needs of a rising global population. 3
    AIoT Applications in Sustainable Agriculture Global food security depends on agriculture,
    yet climate change, water shortages, and resource management pose concerns. The
    AIoT can solve these problems and improve agriculture’s sustainability. AIoT systems
    monitor and optimize agricultural processes using sensors, data analytics, and
    real-time connectivity, improving productivity, resource efficiency, and food
    security (Dibia and Nwaigwe 2017; Herzberg et al. 2022). For precision farming,
    AIoT sensors capture soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and crop health
    data. This data may help farmers optimize irrigation, fertilization, and insect
    management for better resource utilization and crop yields. Smart irrigation systems
    optimize watering schedules based on crop water needs using real-time data from
    weather stations and soil moisture sensors (Ambayea et al. 2022). Livestock monitoring
    systems enhance livestock management and food production by detecting health concerns
    early, optimizing feeding patterns, and improving breeding practices. Supply chain
    traceability systems reduce food fraud and ensure food safety by tracking and
    monitoring food goods in real-time (Oberlack et al. 2021). Farmers can modify
    their practices and safeguard their from bad weather using AIoT-based weather
    stations and environmental sensors. Data analytics and integrated pest monitoring
    devices reduce the demand for chemical pesticides and promote eco-friendly pest
    control (Awofeso and Odeyemi 2021). Aquaponics and hydroponics systems automate
    and optimise nutrition and water management, allowing year-round growing, decreased
    water use, and sustainable fish and vegetable production. Farmers need remote
    sensing for crop health and stress to identify illnesses and nutrient shortages
    early and cure them for maximum development and output (Norton 2016). Farmers
    may plan planting, irrigation, and pest management using weather forecasts and
    predictive analytics. Smart farming and precision agriculture improve crop quality,
    food safety, efficiency, sustainability, data-driven decision-making, labour,
    and time (Ambayea et al. 2022; Voora et al. 2022). However, early investment expenditures,
    data privacy and security issues, and farmers’ technical knowledge are obstacles.
    Smart farming may be vital to global food security and environmental sustainability
    as technology advances. Thus, components of precision agriculture are illustrated
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 The components of precision agriculture (Herzberg et al. 2022)
    Full size image 3.1 Smart Irrigation and Water Management Smart irrigation is
    a cutting-edge technique for managing water in agriculture. It allows farmers
    to save water without sacrificing yield. Smart irrigation systems reduce water
    waste while supplying water reliably to crops depending on individual demands,
    local weather, and other data collected from various sensors and AIoT devices
    (Raghuvanshi et al. 2022). Agriculture uses a lot of water, so finding ways to
    save and reuse that water is essential. Smart irrigation systems determine when
    and how much water should be supplied to crops by monitoring soil moisture and
    evapotranspiration rates (Zhang, Xu et al. 2022b). Smart agricultural practices,
    such as drip irrigation and controlled watering systems, are increasingly used
    to reduce water waste from evaporation and runoff. This technology allows farmers
    to minimize labor by remotely controlling irrigation cycles and maintaining a
    steady water supply. Smart irrigation helps conserve water, grow crops with the
    same amount of water, save money, be more eco-friendly, and be less vulnerable
    to climate change (Neupane et al. 2022; Ning and Liu 2015). However, barriers
    to wider adoption exist, including the need for costly upfront investments, specialized
    knowledge, and consistent access to the Internet (Arubayi 2023). Finally, smart
    irrigation and water management provide a game-changing strategy for environmentally
    responsible farming by helping farmers reduce water waste, maximize crop output,
    and safeguard natural resources. Farmers can help ensure food security in the
    face of climate change by adopting smart irrigation practices like drip irrigation
    and automated watering systems (Merem et al. 2018). Smart irrigation in agriculture
    is predicted to play a crucial role in attaining sustainable water management
    and guaranteeing the resilience of agricultural systems as technology develops.
    3.2 Livestock Management and Health Monitoring Livestock management is an important
    part of contemporary agriculture since it ensures the health and production of
    livestock animals (Ali and Choi 2020). AIoT technology is helping to improve livestock
    management and health monitoring. Farmers may monitor their animals’ health, behaviour,
    and position in real-time by employing wearable sensors and tracking devices,
    allowing for early diagnosis of health concerns or irregularities (Okonofua et
    al. 2021). AIoT-enabled monitoring devices give significant data into cattle movement
    and behaviour, assisting farmers in managing grazing patterns and preventing straying.
    Behavioral monitoring may detect indicators of discomfort or changes in eating
    patterns, resulting in better animal welfare (Kochovski and Stankovski 2018).
    One of the most important advantages of AIoT in livestock management is illness
    diagnosis and prevention facilitated by AIoT. AIoT devices may notify farmers
    of any sickness or stress symptoms by monitoring vital signs and physiological
    factors, limiting disease transmission and significant economic losses (Khan and
    Ahmad 2022). Furthermore, AIoT-based data analytics may aid in identifying illness
    patterns and trends, hence contributing to the creation of effective disease preventive
    programmes. AIoT technology increases animal welfare, productivity, labour costs,
    resource management efficiency, illness control, and biosecurity. However, there
    are hurdles to using AIoT in livestock management, such as initial expenses for
    AIoT devices and infrastructure, dependable connection in remote locations, and
    data privacy and security issues (Abdullahi et al. 2022). Finally, AIoT technology
    has revolutionized livestock management and health monitoring in agriculture,
    allowing farmers to carefully monitor the health and behavior of their animals,
    resulting in enhanced animal welfare and production. AIoT-enabled early disease
    detection and prevention improve biosecurity measures and minimize illness-related
    economic losses (Mishra and Pandya 2021; Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). To ensure the
    well-being of animals and farmers, the AIoT integration in livestock management
    will be crucial as technology develops, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Livestock
    management and health monitoring (Darem et al. 2022) Full size image 4 AIoT in
    Food Supply Chain Management The AIoT has changed the logistics and supply chain
    management industries by enabling real-time monitoring and tracing of items in
    transit. Sensors and gadgets enabled by the are built into things, containers,
    and vehicles to track and record data such as location, temperature, and humidity
    (Praveen et al. 2021). This real-time information allows businesses to streamline
    their supply chains and reduce wasted time and money. Due to AIoT-enabled smart
    logistics, companies can improve inventory management, save operating costs, and
    boost customer satisfaction with on-time, precise delivery (Kamble et al. 2019).
    Perishable items’ quality and safety, including fresh fruit, medicines, and vaccinations,
    depend on effective cold chain management and food preservation (Zhong et al.
    2015). Cold chain management powered by the helps keep goods fresh and secure
    across the supply chain, which helps cut down on food waste and boosts food security.
    Assuring the quality and security of goods via sensors and monitoring is crucial.
    Sensors enabled by the can check food for pH, moisture, and pollutants to ensure
    it''s safe and up to standards (Nozari et al. 2022; Rehman Khan et al. 2022).
    The AIoT makes supply chain visibility, transparency, efficiency, cost savings,
    product quality and safety improvements, sustainability, and environmental impact
    possible (Ezenwa 2019). Data privacy and security, standardization and interoperability
    of AIoT systems, and dependable and continuous connection are just a few hurdles
    that need to be cleared before widespread adoption can occur in supply chain and
    food management (Bertin et al. 2022). AIoT-enabled smart logistics and supply
    chain monitoring, cold chain management, and quality and safety assurance are
    revolutionizing how organizations operate and ensuring that supply chain operations
    are efficient and sustainable (Zakeri et al. 2022). Companies can improve logistics,
    protect the freshness of perishable items, and guarantee their products’ safety
    by using real-time data and insights (Zhong et al. 2015). To keep up with the
    demands of the current business environment and ensure the delivery of high-quality
    goods to customers, supply chain management must increasingly use AIoT technologies,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 AIoT in food supply chain management (Zhong et
    al. 2015) Full size image 5 Challenges and Barriers The technological difficulty
    of establishing and maintaining AIoT systems is a major obstacle to their widespread
    use in agriculture. Integrating sensors, devices, and networking technologies
    may be difficult, particularly for small-scale farmers in rural places with little
    infrastructure (Lu 2018). AIoT applications demand real-time data transfer, which
    might be difficult in rural areas. Data security and privacy are crucial as AIoT
    devices create massive volumes of data. Farmers must secure their crop production,
    soil health, and market data against unauthorized access and cyberattacks (Abdullahi
    et al. 2022). Data encryption, access limits, and secure communication protocols
    protect farmers’ vital data. Small-scale farmers and underdeveloped areas may
    struggle to use AIoT technology due to their high upfront costs. AIoT devices,
    sensors, and connection solutions are costly, making it hard for resource-constrained
    farmers to use them (Zimba 2022). Technical support and maintenance may also strain
    finances. Lack of awareness and understanding of AIoT, limited access to technical
    competence, and cultural opposition to new technology may hinder small-scale farmers
    in developing nations. These areas may additionally struggle to embrace AIoT technologies
    due to language and digital literacy issues (Al Qartah 2020). 5.1 Solution and
    Mitigation Technical constraints, data security concerns, financial issues, and
    acceptance hurdles might prevent the broad adoption of AIoT in agriculture, especially
    in small farms and developing nations. Stakeholders, including governments, commercial
    enterprises, and non-profits, must work together to solve these problems (Hammi
    et al. 2022). By promoting accessible and user-friendly AIoT solutions, guaranteeing
    data security, giving financial incentives, and helping farmers with capacity
    development and training, the agricultural industry can maximize AIoT’s potential
    for sustainable and efficient farming (Ouechtati et al. 2021). Simplified and
    User-Friendly Solutions: Small-scale farmers may use AIoT solutions that are user-friendly
    and cost-effective. Plug-and-play AIoT devices and straightforward interfaces
    may help farmers set up and employ AIoT technology (Jayashankar et al. 2018).
    Public–Private Partnerships: Government agencies, private firms, and NGOs may
    work together to deliver AIoT solutions in poor countries. Joint projects may
    overcome financial and technical constraints and give farmers with training and
    assistance (Hammi et al. 2022). Data Security: Encryption and authentication help
    secure farmers’ data from cyberattacks. To protect data privacy, farmers must
    be educated about data security (Bertin et al. 2022). Subsidies and Incentives:
    Government subsidies or financial incentives for adopting AIoT technology might
    encourage small-scale farmers to invest in these solutions. Implementation costs
    may be reduced via cost-sharing and tax incentives. Training and capacity development
    may improve farmers’ digital literacy and technical abilities. Extension programmes
    and training may assist farmers in grasping AIoT devices (Hammi et al. 2022).
    6 Policy and Regulatory Considerations Agriculture might become more sustainable,
    efficient, and productive using AIoT technology. Through different programmes,
    governments worldwide have supported AIoT adoption. These include financial support,
    research and development funding, capacity building and training, regulatory frameworks,
    public–private partnerships, testbeds and demonstration farms, digital infrastructure
    development, data analytics, and decision support, market linkages and e-commerce
    platforms, and policy advocacy (Lu 2018). These projects have helped farmers use
    AIoT to solve agricultural problems, boost production, and adopt sustainable and
    efficient farming methods. International partnerships and standards are critical
    to developing and accepting AIoT-based food security solutions since governments,
    organisations, and stakeholders must work together to solve the agricultural and
    food sectors’ complex problems (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). The widespread use of
    AIoT technology in agriculture has led to sustainable, efficient, and more productive
    farming. Governments worldwide have been actively pushing and supporting the adoption
    of AIoT due to its critical importance (Fang et al. 2012). Governments provide
    financial assistance, grants, and subsidies to encourage farmers and agricultural
    enterprises to invest in AIoT technology. These rebates reduce the out-of-pocket
    expense of implementing an AIoT system or device, making them more feasible for
    farms of all sizes. Government funding for research and development (R&D) programs
    that provide specialized AIoT solutions for agriculture, such as precision agriculture,
    remote sensing, and livestock monitoring, has led to the developing cutting-edge
    tools and methods (Zhang, Li et al. 2022a). Governments host training programs
    and seminars to improve farmers’ and agricultural employees’ familiarity with
    digital literacy and technical abilities. They set up legislative frameworks that
    make it easier for farmers to use AIoT. Governments create standards for AIoT
    devices and data privacy rules to guarantee the safety of AIoT solutions and protect
    farmers’ data. They work with businesses, universities, and NGOs to promote the
    use of AIoT in farming via public–private partnerships, resulting in increased
    opportunities for information exchange, access to cutting-edge technology, and
    the creation of industry-specific AIoT solutions (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Governments
    also invest in constructing and updating digital infrastructure, such as high-speed
    internet access and mobile networks, to guarantee uninterrupted data transfer
    and communication between farm AIoT devices. They provide data analytics and decision
    support systems that use information gathered from AIoT devices to advise farmers
    on improving their operations (Yin et al. 2022). Governments also develop e-commerce
    platforms that link farmers with customers or purchasers, improving market connections
    and maintaining produce quality and traceability throughout the supply chain.
    Governments advocate for policies that encourage the use of AIoT in farming, such
    as lowering taxes, fostering cross-institutional research partnerships, and lobbying
    for more lenient rules (Godager et al. 2021). The extensive use of AIoT technology
    in agriculture can be attributed to various factors, including financial incentives,
    R&D funding, capacity building, regulatory frameworks, public–private partnerships,
    and the growth of digital infrastructure (Yang et al. 2021). Sharing knowledge
    and best practices helps advance AIoT-based food security solutions. International
    cooperation and standards are essential for food security. Sharing knowledge,
    harmonizing standards, aggregating data, fostering research and development, aligning
    policies, pooling resources, and building capacities can help countries and organisations
    develop cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions for the global agriculture
    and food sectors (Kumar et al. 2020). These agreements allow data exchange and
    aggregation, improving AIoT-based food security solutions. Cross-border research
    and development projects bring together professionals from various nations to
    solve food security issues, resulting in cutting-edge technology and novel solutions
    (Yin et al. 2022). Funding and resource allocation, capacity development and training,
    scaling up successful projects, and addressing data privacy and security issues
    are all examples of ways in which policy alignment and collaboration may be fostered.
    Thus, AIoT-based food security solutions can only be fully realised via international
    cooperation and standardization. Sharing information, harmonizing standards, gathering
    data, promoting research and development, aligning policies, pooling resources,
    and creating skills may help governments and organizations handle global food
    security issues. These combined efforts will lead to sustainable and resilient
    food systems for everybody (Chilaka and Chilaka 2019). 7 Case Studies and Real-World
    Implementations The ability of AIoT solutions to tackle difficult problems and
    propel good change has been shown by their widespread adoption in some countries.
    AIoT technology may enhance productivity, sustainability, and resource management,
    as shown by the featured case studies in precision agriculture, fisheries management,
    and smart grids. Guidelines for future AIoT implementations may be derived from
    the lessons gained and best practices in interoperability, data security, user-centric
    design, and local context concerns (Yin et al. 2022). In order to create a more
    sustainable and interconnected society, AIoT solutions must continue to develop
    and cooperate. Many sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, transportation,
    and more, have been radically altered by AIoT development. This section looks
    at real-world deployments of AIoT technologies in various areas to draw up lessons
    and best practices (Yin et al. 2022). Some globally effective solutions are (Cliff
    et al. 2023; Godager et al. 2021). Accurate farming methods in the USA: Precision
    farming has become more popular in the United States. Farmers use the devices
    like soil sensors, weather stations, and drones to monitor their crops and ensure
    everything is running well. Farmers may improve their irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest management methods with real-time data from these sensors. Sustainable
    agriculture has benefited from increased agricultural yields and more effective
    use of available resources. Norwegian Smart Fishery Management: Norway has introduced
    -based solutions to encourage responsible fishing practices in its fisheries sector.
    AIoT technologies like GPS trackers and sensors are installed aboard fishing boats
    to keep tabs on catch rates, fish stocks, and environmental factors. By using
    this information, authorities can better enforce fishing limits, curb overfishing,
    and safeguard marine ecosystems, assuring the fishing industry''s continued success.
    South Korean smart grids: South Korea''s energy industry has made great efforts
    towards implementing technology. (AIoT) sensors are used in smart grids for real-time
    monitoring of energy usage, distribution optimisation, and problem detection.
    Improved grid efficiency in South Korea has resulted in lower energy costs and
    greater sustainability through lowering energy waste and increasing energy dependability.
    7.1 Best Practices and Real-World Lessons The practices and real-world lessons
    include (Janabi and Kurnaz 2023): Standardisation and Compatibility: Successful
    systems need standardized communication protocols and the ability to easily integrate
    new hardware and software. The easy sharing of data and compatibility across various
    AIoT components are made possible by establishing interoperability. Data Privacy
    and Protection: Sensitive data must be collected and sent securely in AIoT implementations.
    To defend against cyber risks and preserve user privacy, implementers should prioritize
    data encryption, user authentication, and data access restrictions. User-centered
    design: Users are the focus of good design. To increase user adoption and engagement,
    it is important to provide user-friendly interfaces, clear representations, and
    intuitive functionality. Flexibility and scalability: The data volume and the
    number of connected devices are expected to grow over time. Therefore, AIoT implementations
    must be flexible. As a result of its adaptability, new technologies, and future
    growth may be easily included. Consideration of the Local Context: Successful
    installations need adjustments for each unique situation. To provide successful
    solutions, it is essential to appreciate various geographical areas’ specific
    difficulties, cultural subtleties, and infrastructural limitations. Coordination
    and Cooperation: Governments, businesses, universities, and communities all have
    a stake in a successful rollout of the Partners may pool their knowledge, skills,
    and resources through collaboration to create long-lasting improvements. Control
    and Assessment: To determine how successful an AIoT solution is and where it may
    be enhanced, constant monitoring and assessment are required. Insights derived
    from data analysis support continual optimization and enable evidence-based decision-making.
    Instruction and Capacity Development: The knowledge and proficiency of end-users
    and implementers of AIoT technologies may be improved via training and capacity-building
    programs. Building people''s abilities is crucial to ensuring that the solutions
    have the desired effect. 8 Future Trends and Innovations The AIoT has advanced
    swiftly and is continuing to drive innovation. In the not-too-distant future,
    AIoT technologies will merge with AI and machine learning, resulting in unheard-of
    levels of efficiency and automation. The introduction of 5G technology and the
    development of edge computing will also usher in a new era of AIoT applications,
    particularly in the agricultural industry (Saad et al. 2023). Improvements in
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, and edge computing point to a bright
    future for AIoT in agriculture by fueling substantial gains in efficiency, sustainability,
    and production. 5G and edge computing will improve connection and data processing,
    and combining AI and machine learning with AIoT will allow for predictive analytics
    and autonomous systems. Precision farming, smart irrigation, remote monitoring,
    and evidence-based decision-making are just some ways the AIoT will revolutionise
    agriculture and strengthen the foundations of sustainable agriculture worldwide
    (Seyyedabbasi et al. 2023). The potential for innovation and beneficial influence
    on the agricultural business is limitless as these technologies continue to advance.
    The potential impact of 5G and edge computing on AIoT applications in agriculture
    and future trends and breakthroughs in AIoT are discussed. 8.1 Future Trends and
    Innovations in AIoT Increasing connectivity among AIoT devices will provide simple
    two-way communication and data sharing. Because of this enhanced connectedness,
    data analysis and decision-making will become more holistic and integrated. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms will be included into AIoT
    devices, allowing them to analyse and anticipate trends and patterns in real-time
    data (Garg and Goyal 2020). As a result of this capacity, procedures and resource
    allocation may be optimised for greater efficacy. With edge computing, processing
    may be done closer to the data source, which speeds up processing and decreases
    latency. Edge intelligence-equipped AIoT devices will be able to do sophisticated
    tasks locally, cutting down on demand for cloud computing. The AIoT, AI, and ML
    will merge to generate fully autonomous systems. As a result, production will
    rise, human errors will decrease, and efficiency will improve. AIoT will revolutionize
    urban planning and infrastructure management, leading to the construction of smart
    cities with linked transportation, electricity, waste management, and more systems
    (Mousavi et al. 2021). 8.2 Integration of AIoT, AI, and Machine Learning AI and
    ML algorithms will analyze massive volumes of data the AIoT creates. This will
    allow for enhanced knowledge of agricultural procedures and more efficient use
    of available resources (Olan et al. 2022). Precision agriculture will become a
    reality in which farmers administer inputs like water and fertiliser with pinpoint
    accuracy using real-time data and analysis made possible by AI-driven AIoT apps.
    By taking this course of action, both yields and environmental impact may be improved.
    With AI, devices can anticipate when agricultural machinery and equipment need
    repair (Olan et al. 2022; Pan and Zhang 2021). 8.3 The Possible Effect of 5G and
    Edge Computing on Applications in Farming With the increased bandwidth and decreased
    latency that 5G networks provide, the AIoT can communicate with one another in
    near real-time. With the help of 5G and edge computing, farmers can keep an eye
    on their crops and animals without leaving their homes (Rathod et al. 2023). Data-intensive
    AIoT applications, such as high-resolution image and video analytics, will be
    supported by 5G’s fast data rates and the processing capabilities of edge computing,
    enhancing agricultural monitoring and analysis. AIoT-enabled irrigation systems
    with 5G connection and edge computing can optimize water consumption and save
    waste by adjusting the amount of water supplied depending on real-time data, soil
    moisture levels, and weather predictions (Varsha et al. 2021). 9 Conclusion This
    chapter examines the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices via data-driven
    decision-making and precision agriculture on the path to sustainable agriculture
    and food security. Agricultural output, resource effectiveness, and supply chain
    management benefit greatly from AIoT-enabled systems. AIoT improves agricultural
    operations by helping farmers and stakeholders make better choices based on real-time
    data and analytics. Due to the AIoT, farmers can track and manage their crops
    with pinpoint accuracy, improving efficiency, lessening environmental damage,
    and boosting agricultural yields. By allowing farmers to adjust water distribution
    in response to current weather and crop circumstances, smart irrigation systems
    improve water efficiency while decreasing water waste. Better illness diagnosis,
    health assessment, and livestock management contribute to happier, healthier animals.
    A well-oiled supply chain guarantees that food is safe to eat, cuts down on post-harvest
    losses, and speeds up the delivery of crops to consumers. AIoT plays a crucial
    role in developing sustainable agriculture and attaining global food security
    by using real-time data and analytics and closing the information gap between
    farmers, agribusinesses, and consumers. With the ongoing development of AIoT,
    AI, and 5G technologies, the future of AIoT in agriculture seems bright. Data
    security, privacy issues, high implementation costs, and accessibility for small-scale
    farmers in underdeveloped countries are only some of the obstacles that must be
    overcome. Understanding AIoT''s societal and economic effects on agriculture requires
    a study conducted by agronomists, environmentalists, and social scientists. Investing
    in AIoT-related research and development may lead to a future where agriculture
    is more sustainable, productive, and ecologically aware. References Abdullahi

    Agency: SECTION I. Introduction From the earliest agrarian societies to the present
    day, agriculture plays a crucial role in sustaining human life. It basically includes
    the activities such as cultivating the soil, farming, and raising livestock for
    use by humans [1]. Agriculture is not just about the food production. It also
    has a significant impact on economic growth, rural development, maintaining biodiversity,
    shaping the cultural heritage, and in providing various ecosystem services such
    as water filtration, pollination, and habitat for wildlife. The way in which agricultural
    practices are carried out has evolved over time by incorporating various scientific
    advancements. Remote sensing technologies play a major role in today''s agriculture,
    thereby enhancing the sustainability and productivity to a large extent. There
    are different types of remote sensing technologies that can be adopted in agriculture.
    This includes thermal imaging, multispectral imaging, radar, light detection and
    ranging (LiDAR), aerial imagery, satellite imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
    etc. [2], [3]. Drones and satellites equipped with sensors significantly help
    in enhancing the efficiency and decision-making strategies in agriculture, thereby
    addressing the various challenges through data-driven insights. Different types
    of remote sensing sensors can be employed for specific functions in the agriculture
    arena [4], [5]. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are typically used for
    monitoring the crop growth, moisture content in the soil, and also for efficient
    classification of crops. Similarly, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and
    fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging sensors also can be employed for understanding
    the various attributes such as leaf area index, nitrogen content, etc. Visible
    RGB (VIS) sensors can be used for estimating the different geometric attributes.
    Yet another sensor is the near-infrared (NIR) that helps in analyzing the moisture
    content in soil, plant counting, and even for erosion analysis. Remote sensing
    technology along with other technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), robotic
    systems, weather forecasting technology, and global positioning systems (GPSs)
    play a major role in precision agriculture as well [6], [7]. Remote sensing thus
    aids agriculture in a variety of aspects. One of the major applications is in
    monitoring the crops [8]. It can be regarded as the systematic process of observing,
    assessing, and collecting data about crops through the entire span of their growth
    cycle. The images collected using satellites can be used for the identification
    of stress factors, such as water scarcity, nutrient deficiencies, or pest infestations.
    Other applications include soil condition assessment, crop yield prediction, resource
    optimization, early detection of pests and diseases, environmental monitoring,
    global coverage, and time and labor savings. Although remote sensing can help
    in various aspects of agriculture from crop monitoring to soil analysis and precision
    agriculture, the implementation is not without its challenges. Limited access
    to high-quality data is one of the significant challenges associated with the
    remote sensing technologies. As the data are complex, it needs expertise to understand
    and analyze the data. Hong et al. [9] proposed a subpixel-level HS superresolution
    framework that has the capacity to utilize the intrinsic properties of high spatial
    resolution multispectral images effectively for the fusion task. Cloud cover is
    another major challenge that may result in gathering inaccurate data due to the
    clouds [10]. Zhang et al. [11] proposed a CNN model for removing cloud cover interference.
    Another challenge is with regard to the lack of technical expertise in adopting
    these technologies in agriculture. Weather conditions, spatial and temporal resolutions
    of remote sensing data, data security, and privacy issues are all the other vital
    challenges concerning the adoption of remote sensing for agriculture. Extensive
    research has been carried out in the field of remote sensing to deal with the
    aforementioned challenges [12], [13], [14]. Industry 5.0 (I5.0) technologies also
    can significantly help in overcoming these challenges associated with the implementation
    of remote sensing for agriculture. I5.0 is considered as a new production model
    where robots and machines work alongside humans. The key principles of I5.0 are
    sustainability, human centricity, and resilience [15]. The farmers and agronomists
    along with the artificial intelligence (AI) systems can efficiently analyze the
    remote sensing data that can help in generating more accurate interpretations,
    thus enabling informed decision making. Personalization is yet another advantage
    of adopting I5.0 in the agriculture domain. This will enable the farmers to get
    personalized recommendations based on specific farm requirements. Real-time decisions
    can be provided to the end users, thereby improving the responsiveness of the
    various agricultural practices. The agriculture sector can achieve greater sustainability,
    efficiency, and collaboration in farming practices by adopting the principles
    of I5.0 and fully embracing remote sensing technologies. Several surveys have
    been carried out by researchers on the various Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and I5.0 technologies,
    different application domains, technical challenges associated with the implementation,
    and remote sensing technologies. Abbasi et al. [16] presented the state-of-the-art
    digitization technologies that could be adopted for agriculture. However, the
    survey was focused on I4.0 and not on I5.0. Yet another survey was conducted by
    Liu et al. [17], including a comprehensive analysis of the status, enabling technologies,
    and the potential challenges in adopting Agriculture 4.0. However, Raj et al.
    [18] conducted a study on the role of IoT in adopting the Agriculture 4.0 practices.
    Javaid et al. [19] also focused on the Agriculture 4.0 practices. Remote sensing
    technologies were also studied in the aforementioned surveys. However, only very
    few studies have been carried out so far on the role of remote sensing for agriculture
    in the I5.0 era. Martos et al. [4] presented a study on remote sensing for Agriculture
    5.0 in order to ensure the sustainability in agriculture. However, the focus was
    majorly on the important features of the remote sensing technologies such as the
    various data-retrieving approaches, electromagnetic (EM) wave bands, and the importance
    of AI for Agriculture 5.0. The key platforms such as the various sensors used
    and also on satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) were also discussed
    in this study. Nevertheless, the specific target application fields in agriculture
    were not dealt in depth. The technical challenges with respect to the I5.0 integration
    were also not presented. Guruswamy et al. [20] put forward a study on ensuring
    food security in the context of Agriculture 5.0. The role of remote sensing was
    not covered in this study. Another study was by Singh et al. [21] that focused
    primarily on the precision irrigation aspects using I5.0 technologies. A detailed
    review of the enabling technologies and potential applications in I5.0 was presented
    by Maddikunta et al. [22]. However, the study did not focus on the specific aspects
    of agriculture. The role of I5.0 technologies in crop data management was studied
    by Saiz-Rubio et al. [23]. Although few research works have been carried out on
    the use of I5.0 for general applications, none of them comprehensively addresses
    all of the technologies and various target application fields in the agriculture
    domain. Table I presents a summary of the related surveys on remote sensing for
    agriculture in the I5.0 era. Even though several surveys on I5.0 and remote sensing
    for agriculture have been carried out separately, there is no survey focusing
    specifically on remote sensing for agriculture in the era of I5.0. This is the
    first work attempting to review remote sensing for agriculture in the era of I5.0,
    to the best of our knowledge. The significant contributions of this study are
    highlighted as follows. TABLE I Summary of Literature Survey The article presents
    a detailed discussion on the various remote sensing technologies used in agriculture,
    and the associated I5.0 enabling technologies such as data-driven data analytics,
    robotics, automation, etc. The underlying inspiration for adopting the remote
    sensing technologies in various aspects of agriculture in I5.0 is also discussed
    in this survey. A detailed analysis of the various applications of I5.0-enabled
    remote sensing for agriculture is provided along with the existing challenges
    and how I5.0 adoption may help in overcoming those challenges. The article presents
    the several challenges that may arise during the integration of remote sensing
    for agriculture and I5.0 applications. The open research opportunities that may
    drive the researchers and industry toward future research in this interesting
    domain are also highlighted in this work. The rest of the article is organized
    as follows: Section II highlights the importance of remote sensing for agriculture.
    The section also focuses on the various enabling technologies of I5.0 that can
    be adopted specifically for agriculture, and the motivation behind the integration
    of remote sensing for agriculture and I5.0 is also highlighted. Section III deals
    with the various applications of I5.0-enabled remote sensing for agriculture.
    Each section in Section III provides a brief introduction about the application,
    the existing challenges, and how the adoption of I5.0 technologies may help in
    terms of sustainability, human centricity, and resilience. In Section IV, we highlight
    the challenges and open issues of this I5.0 integration in agriculture and throw
    light into the possible research directions. Finally, Section VI concludes this
    article. SECTION II. Background A. Remote Sensing for Agriculture Conventional
    agricultural methods depended on human and some domesticated animal strength to
    carry out tasks including field preparation, irrigation, harvesting, and monitoring.
    Simple tools such as hoes, sickles, and scythes were the mainstay of early agriculture
    [24]. However, using this tool required immense human effort and significant time,
    but with low yields. This sustained agriculture method is defined by local knowledge,
    labor-intensive tasks, less access to markets, low yields, and significant risks.
    Remote sensing technologies have transformed the field of agriculture, offering
    diverse and modern tools for monitoring and managing agricultural behaviors [25].
    Thermal imaging allows for the detection of heat in crops and soil, providing
    valuable insights into water levels and disease occurrence [26]. Multispectral
    imaging captures data at different wavelengths, enabling detailed analysis of
    plant health, soil properties, and moisture levels [27]. Radar technology detects
    cloud patterns and provides data regardless of the weather, making it useful for
    analyzing soil moisture and estimating crop biomass [28]. LiDAR is useful in analyzing
    landscape and crop structures assessment based on its high-resolution 3-D mapping
    features [29]. Aerial imagery, captured by aircraft or drones, presents high-resolution
    images for complete field examination. Satellite imagery provides a broader view,
    essential for large-scale monitoring of crop health, land use, and environmental
    changes [30], [31]. UAVs collect agriculture data in a personalized and accurate
    manner, making them useful for specific investigations and continuous monitoring
    [32]. All of these technologies work together to achieve modern precision agriculture,
    assisting farmers and scientists in making accurate choices about effective and
    environmentally friendly farming practices. Table II presents the different types
    of remote sensing technologies used in agriculture. Fig. 1 depicts Remote Sensing
    in Agriculture. TABLE II Different Types of Remote Sensing Technologies Used in
    Agriculture Following the 18th century, during the steam power revolution, machinery
    began to take the place of human labor. This made it easier for small-scale farmers
    to meet the expanding food needs of the populace by producing food on a huge scale.
    The quick transition from steam to internal combustion engines improved agricultural
    productivity much further [60]. Later in the 20th century, the incorporation of
    machinery and electronics opened the door for specialized agricultural methods
    including GPS-assisted automated tractors, planting robots, automated irrigation
    systems, and analytical and monitoring instruments [61]. Apart from the boost
    in food production, the shift from traditional to commercial agriculture practices
    has noteworthy effects on society, including decreased labor requirements for
    human labor, large-scale farming, and meeting market demands [62]. Preprogrammed
    instructions are used by the automated machinery to carry out tasks mindlessly
    and without context awareness. Resources are used more efficiently and take less
    time when manual monitoring and analytical reasoning are combined with automation.
    However, large-scale agriculture is hard for humans to intervene in, which makes
    labor even more necessary due to time constraints [63]. The science and technology
    of gathering data about the Earth''s terrestrial, atmospheric, and aquatic ecosystems
    from their emitted and reflected EM radiation is called remote sensing. It is
    a type of geospatial technology used to monitor the physical characteristics of
    an object without coming into direct contact with it. It mainly uses a variety
    of sensors installed on airplanes, drones, satellites, or vehicles to gather information
    on the Earth''s surface and atmosphere [64]. Precision farming uses automated
    methods, which are assisted by human interaction, and remote sensing as a supplement.
    In agricultural remote sensing, data regarding pest outbreaks, soil moisture,
    vegetation monitoring, irrigation levels, and the overall health of agricultural
    elements can be continuously sensed and provided to the automated machinery. B.
    Technologies Driven by I5.0 for Agriculture 1) Data-Driven Data Analytics Advanced
    data analysis algorithms enable us to create a virtual model that allows us to
    simulate the environment and test different strategies before implementing them
    in a real-world scenario. For example, farmers can experiment in the simulated
    environment with different fertilizers, and pest control mechanisms to optimize
    the resources and reduce risks [65]. Recognizing pests and plants for agricultural
    protection can be achieved with minimal data, making it a cost-effective solution
    for farmers. Li and Yang [66] proposed a method called “metalearning few-shot
    classification” that learns from just a few examples. This method “mimics” real-world
    scenarios by training on diverse data representing potential pests and plants.
    Using publicly available resources, we built a balanced database for effective
    training. Similar to this, sophisticated data analysis tools facilitate the examination
    of large datasets to provide new perspectives on difficult-to-understand systems.
    Object and feature classification, trend and pattern recognition, all depend heavily
    on data-driven data analysis. To benefit nontechnical users including end users
    and policymakers, data analysis tools assist in processing data and producing
    output in an easily understandable format. Metalearning aims to create models
    that can quickly adapt to new tasks using minimal data. It focuses on using previous
    knowledge to increase learning efficiency and generalization. More interestingly,
    Tseng et al. [67] proposed TIML: task-informed metalearning for agriculture. The
    primary goal of this study is to investigate how model-agnostic metalearning (MAML)
    weights can be modulated, even when all tasks were selected from a single dataset.
    The experiments were carried out using the CropHarvest dataset. The experimental
    results show that the proposed TIML approach outperforms other algorithms on the
    CropHarvest dataset, with the highest F1 and AUC ROC scores. TIML consistently
    outperforms other algorithms across all tasks, including a difficult Brazil task
    with only 26 positive datapoints. Another interesting research in [68] shows how
    metalearning, specifically MAML, can effectively learn from different datasets
    while preserving the unique information that exists in each dataset. The proposed
    model is a metalearning approach that uses a long short-term memory model to determine
    whether pixels contain a specific crop or not. The primary goal of this study
    is to determine the efficiency of the proposed model in different locations and
    creating crop maps for particular geographic areas with limited positive task
    labels. The experiments were conducted on three datasets: 1) Togo, 2) Kenya, and
    3) Brazil. The experimental findings show that the proposed metalearning approach
    outperforms both random and pretrained baselines in different locations. Few-shot
    learning in remote sensing agriculture allows the efficient training of models
    with limited labeled data, vital for sparse and dynamic agricultural landscapes.
    By making use of transfer learning and metalearning techniques, it simplifies
    rapid adaptation to new environments and crop types. A work proposed in [69] on
    few-short learning introduces a method called DLA-MatchNet for remote sensing
    image scene classification. It targets learning discriminative representations
    and an appropriate metric for remote sensing images, which is frequently overlooked
    by existing works. The attention technique was employed to discover discriminative
    regions and an adaptive matcher was used to address issues of large intraclass
    variances and interclass similarity. Experimental results on three public remote
    sensing image datasets show the effectiveness of the model in few-shot scene classification.
    Another work done by Kim and Chi in [70] created a network called SAFFNet, a self-attention-based
    feature fusion network, for remote sensing few-shot scene classification. The
    authors underline the challenges in classifying new unseen scene categories in
    remote sensing applications and the significance of few-shot learning methods.
    SAFFNet integrates a self-attention feature selection module to select and reweight
    informative representations from images with different receptive fields for feature
    fusion. The proposed model is evaluated and assessed on publicly available datasets
    and compared to other few-shot approaches and multiscale feature fusion networks.
    Experimental results demonstrate that SAFFNet significantly enhances few-shot
    classification accuracy. 2) Robotics and Automation Automation can reduce human
    labor''s demanding nature and exposure to hazardous conditions, improving worker
    well-being and changing the appeal of agriculture as a job. Because robots can
    operate continually, they are more productive and efficient [71]. Cameras mounted
    on drones or land vehicles capture images of the crop and livestock that are used
    for further analysis and decision making. Vision-guided robots may carry out tasks
    autonomously, such as milking cows, which enhances sanitation. Based on real-time
    data and forecasts, AI will suggest exact methods for harvesting, fertilizing,
    controlling pests, and irrigation. Farmers can make well-informed decisions about
    irrigation, fertilizing, and pest control because of the data that drones and
    sensors on robots collect about soil conditions, crop health, and water levels.
    Using real-time data, robots may apply water, fertilizer, and insecticides at
    different rates to maximize resource efficiency and reduce environmental effects
    [72]. 3) Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology On a blockchain, tampering
    with data is practically impossible, reducing the possibility of fake goods or
    incorrectly labeled substances and thwarting fraud involving agricultural products
    [73]. All parties involved, from farmers to merchants, have access to reliable
    information regarding food production, processing, and transportation, which promotes
    collaboration and prevents fraud. Transparency in supply chains helps avoid fraud
    in the case of access to subsidy products by guaranteeing that the required and
    eligible individuals receive subsidies. As a result, the actual farmers are encouraged
    and receive financial support. The transparency characteristic of blockchain would
    lessen fraud risk scenarios, which would benefit the actual user. Another similar
    case is manipulating data when claiming insurance for damaged objects, such as
    land, crops, and animals, after natural calamities [74]. 4) Human–Machine Collaboration
    and Upskilling The IoT devices concentrate on isolated items such as individual
    plants or animals or in compact spaces. This results in the need for frequent
    manual monitoring and adjustments to robot operations, which raises labor costs
    and increases the possibility of human error. Remote sensing and IoT are both
    essential to the collection and processing of data, although they function on
    different scales and have different goals. Robust remote sensing data streams
    are necessary to fine-tune and enhance robot algorithms for increased efficacy
    [75]. Large-scale coverage is offered by remote sensing, which offers a comprehensive
    picture of changing environmental conditions, weather patterns, and landscapes.
    C. Motivation for the Integration of Remote Sensing for Agriculture and I5.0 Embracing
    I5.0 and remote sensing in agriculture gives a powerful chance to transform the
    sector, solving issues and realizing enormous potential. Remote sensing will continue
    to be essential in many agricultural domains by utilizing I5.0 technologies, improving
    human well-being, resource management, and decision making. With technological
    improvements, the future of remote sensing for agriculture seems bright. Here
    are some key motivations for embracing this transformative approach. 1) Motivation
    1. Advanced Sensing and Data Acquisition Real-time data about crop growth, animal
    movements, environmental changes, weather, air and water quality, moisture content,
    pollutants, and other vulnerabilities are collected by satellites, drones, and
    integrated sensors in machinery and vehicles [76]. Biosensors can provide information
    on the stress level, deficits, and other possible insights of a plant or animal.
    Targeted insecticides can be applied by robotic devices that use vision sensors.
    Advanced remote sensing methods such as hyperspectral imaging are becoming more
    and more popular. Hyperspectral imaging systems can be used to find, classify,
    or measure the concentration of different components that are undetectable to
    standard cameras or the human eye during an inspection [77], [78]. 2) Motivation
    2. Resilience and Sustainability Cobots are made for intimate human connection,
    in contrast to standard robots that are usually kept in cages or isolated work
    areas [79]. Examples of duties that Cobots can automate are feeding, keeping an
    eye on the health of the animals, and gathering information on behavior and productivity.
    Likewise, Cobots can help with accurate seed planting, delicately selecting and
    plucking fruits and vegetables, and classifying produce according to size and
    quality. With the use of COBOTS, farmers may create resilient agricultural practices
    and adjust to shifting weather patterns using remote sensing data-driven decision
    making. Utilizing real-time data enables farmers to adapt using various techniques,
    reducing the likelihood of disruptions and preserving food production [80]. 3)
    Motivation 3. Empowerment and Human-Centric Approach The focus of I5.0 is on the
    human-in-loop across all dimensions [81]. Therefore, combining remote sensing
    with I5.0 enables farmers to have access to remote sensing data, insights, and
    decision-making tools. Automation improves the quality of farmer''s life and I5.0
    technologies, such as Digital Twin, enable farmers to test out different scenarios
    leading to better decision making about the various agricultural components, which
    enhances risk management and reduces agricultural losses. A broader spectrum of
    users can utilize cobots because they are easy to operate even by those without
    extensive technological knowledge. SECTION III. Applications of I5.0-Enabled Remote
    Sensing for Agriculture The applications of I5.0-enabled remote sensing in agriculture
    span a wide spectrum, catalyzing transformative changes across key sectors. In
    the domain of supply chain monitoring, this I5.0 integration simplifies real-time
    tracking and optimization, improving the efficiency of agricultural logistics.
    Crop monitoring benefits from the adoption of advanced sensors, IoT devices, and
    AI algorithms, allowing farmers to obtain precise data on crop growth, health,
    and yield predictions, thereby optimizing cultivation approaches. Water management
    perceives developments through the intelligent use of remote sensing, helping
    farmers monitor and regulate water usage more effectively. Plant disease identification
    is reformed with the aid of sophisticated sensors and AI, allowing early detection
    and targeted treatment interventions. Precision agriculture makes use of I5.0
    technologies to enhance decision-making processes, enhance resource utilization,
    and reduce environmental impact. Environment monitoring includes the tracking
    of environmental factors, contributing to sustainable farming practices. Soil
    health monitoring provides farmers with more details concerning soil conditions,
    fostering better-informed decisions for optimal crop growth. Agriculture education
    profits from immersive technology integration by offering students and practitioners
    hands-on experiences through virtual simulations. Finally, livestock management
    is augmented through remote sensing applications, allowing real-time tracking,
    health monitoring, and efficient herd management. These various applications collectively
    highlight the multifaceted impact of I5.0-enabled remote sensing, steering to
    a new era of precision, sustainability, and productivity in agriculture (see Fig.
    4). This section discusses in detail about the impact of I5.0 on remote sensing
    for various applications in agriculture. Fig. 1. Remote sensing in agriculture.

    and I5.0 principles for sustainable farming. Show All Fig. 4. Applications of
    I5.0-enabled remote sensing for agriculture. Show All A. Supply Chain Monitoring
    Agriculture and supply chain management (SCM) are intrinsically interconnected
    in a mutually beneficial relationship that supports the production and distribution
    of food and other agricultural products. Agriculture functions as the primary
    source of raw materials within the supply chain [82]. It provides crops, livestock,
    and various resources that lie as the backbone of numerous industries. SCM ensures
    that these agricultural products are efficiently, safely, and cost-effectively
    transported from farms to consumers. SCMs role in agriculture prolongs from improving
    production schedules and postharvest handling to managing distribution networks
    and obeying to quality and safety standards [83]. In essence, SCM acts as the
    channel between the fields and forks, allowing the agricultural sector to meet
    market needs, reduce waste, and improve overall sustainability [84]. This complicated
    relationship highlights the critical importance of effective SCM in confirming
    the success, reliability, and resilience of the agricultural industry. Here are
    some key phases of SCM in agriculture [17]: 1) planning and forecasting, 2) sourcing
    and procurement, 3) production and cultivation, 4) harvesting and delivery, and
    5) monitoring and traceability. Agricultural SCM faces a multitude of challenges
    [85] due to the sector''s distinct characteristics and demands. Seasonal variability
    is very common in agriculture and is driven by aspects such as weather conditions
    and crop cycles, giving significant hurdles to SCM efficiency. Additionally, the
    easy decomposable nature of many agricultural products, such as fruits and dairy,
    requires rigorous efforts to maintain product quality and freshness throughout
    the supply chain. Stakeholder coordination, including farmers, processors, distributors,
    and retailers, can be complex, especially in rural areas. Unpredictable changes
    in crop yields and market demand contribute to SCM uncertainty [86]. This also
    affects production planning and inventory management. Sustainability issues and
    environmental regulations demand balancing profitability with environmentally
    responsible practices. Compliance with stringent regulations related to food safety
    and quality is another ongoing challenge. Quality control and traceability systems
    are vital but complex and expensive to implement. I5.0 integration has the potential
    to revolutionize the field of supply chain processes, focusing on collaboration
    between humans and machines [87]. The integration of I5.0, which typically involves
    cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, blockchain, DT, and AI, can use remote
    sensing data and has the potential to bring about a significant transformation
    in supply chain processes. The importance lies in the development of collaboration
    between human workers and machines to enhance efficiency, productivity, and sustainability
    in the supply chain, aligning with the core principles of I5.0 [88]. Here is how
    I5.0 can use remote sensing data to enhance agricultural SCM. Remote sensing has
    become an innovative tool in agriculture, providing farmers with a wealth of information
    about their crops and fields from a bird''s-eye view. Satellite imagery, drones,
    and IoT sensors can provide a wealth of data, such as crop health, soil moisture,
    nutrient content, etc., allowing farmers to monitor fields in real time. AI has
    the potential to transform precision agriculture into agricultural SCM [89]. Advanced
    AI algorithms can integrate data from various sources to create a comprehensive
    picture of crop health. It can analyze remote sensing data to detect even minor
    changes in vegetation health, recognizing potential diseases before they are visible
    [90]. By examining historical and current data, it can predict issues such as
    nutrient deficiencies, allowing farmers to proactively address challenges and
    optimize crop yield. This collaboration involves not only the capabilities of
    AI but also the expertise of humans, who contribute valuable insights into local
    conditions and practices, aligning with the human-centric approach of I5.0. In
    [91], Shadrin et al. proposed a work that involves the development of a scalable
    smart agriculture system using wireless sensor nodes and machine learning (ML)
    for plant growth assessment. Remote sensing data, when combined with advanced
    analytics using ML, can be used to predict crop yields [92]. These data are valuable
    for optimizing supply chain planning, including production scheduling and distribution.
    Another research effort [93] used ML to predict almond yield based on climate
    and orchard variables. The authors found that winter conditions and summer vapor
    pressure deficits significantly affect yield. The authors'' findings aim to inform
    cultivators about adapting management practices for plant protection in changing
    climates. The data derived from remote sensing not only help in predicting yields
    but also bring them into line with a sustainable approach, a core principle of
    I5.0. Table III depicts the roles of I5.0 in the agricultural supply chain monitoring.
    Building trust and transparency in any process is another crucial ideology in
    I5.0. Blockchain integration in agricultural SCM has the potential to offer transparency
    and traceability features in the SCM process [94]. Blockchain, with its immutable
    and transparent ledger, improves trust by providing a tamper-proof record of the
    entire supply chain journey. Remote sensing data, combined with blockchain, can
    improve transparency and traceability aspect in the supply chain [95]. Consumers
    can monitor the journey of agricultural products from farm to table, confirming
    quality and authenticity. The proposed work in [96] focuses on evaluating the
    maturity level of blockchain technology within the agri-food supply chain. The
    work found that blockchain technology offers significant benefits, such as allowing
    stakeholders and consumers to access reliable information, tracking goods effectively,
    and dropping the need for third-party monitoring. The study also identified smart
    contracts, IoT, transaction records, and traceability tags as the significant
    elements that can improve the agricultural supply chain when integrated with blockchain
    technology. TABLE III Roles of I5.0 in the Agricultural Supply Chain Monitoring
    B. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring in agriculture comprises the systematic observation
    and assessment of crops throughout their growth cycle to improve productivity
    and make informed decisions. This process uses a combination of technology, data
    analysis, and traditional agricultural methods to monitor various aspects of crop
    health [97]. This includes growth patterns, disease occurrence, and resource utilization.
    Recent technologies such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, drones, and sensors
    provide real-time or near-real-time data, allowing farmers to detect problems
    with the crops early [8]. This real-time information about the field also helps
    to make timely interventions and enhance overall crop management. By making use
    of these tools, farmers can make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield,
    resource efficiency, and sustainability in modern agriculture [98]. A large volume
    of data generated by various monitoring methods, such as satellites, drones, and
    sensors, specifically managing and analyzing the data generated efficiently carries
    a significant challenge for farmers, and demands advanced data processing and
    interpretation skills [99]. Deploying monitoring technologies, such as satellite
    imagery and precision agriculture tools, can be expensive [100]. The lack of the
    necessary infrastructure and reliable connectivity for seamless data transmission
    is a big challenge. Limited internet availability in rural areas can restrict
    or delay real-time monitoring and timely response to crop-related issues [101].
    The collection and sharing of agricultural data raise concerns about privacy and
    security [102]. Farmers may not be willing to share sensitive information about
    their crops, soil, and practices, and be scared of unauthorized access or misuse
    of data. Changeable weather patterns, including extreme events such as storms,
    droughts, or floods, can have a serious impact on the effectiveness of crop monitoring.
    These changes can introduce uncertainties and affect the accuracy of predictive
    models. Satellite sensors, including multispectral and hyperspectral, can capture
    data on crop health by measuring the reflectance of different wavelengths [103].
    This remotely sensed data uses vegetation indices such as the normalized difference
    vegetation index, which provides insights into plant health, biomass, and growth
    [104]. ML can be employed to analyze these data to identify areas of stress, nutrient
    deficiencies, or diseases in crops [105], [106], [107]. Interesting work in [108]
    involves using the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) to predict crop
    health. It comprises the classification of major crops in the USA using DESIS
    data and ML algorithms, focusing on corn, soybeans, and winter wheat. This collaborative
    approach makes use of human expertise, the core principle of I5.0, with machine
    capabilities to make timely interventions to monitor crop health. In addressing
    the challenge of securely sharing sensitive information related to farming and
    soil conditions, blockchain technology has evolved as a robust solution [109].
    Blockchain provides a secure and decentralized method to store and manage remote
    sensing data. Farmers can have greater control over who accesses their information
    and can grant or restrict permission through smart contracts [110]. This aligns
    with I5.0’s importance on secure and controlled access to data and technology
    integration [111], confirming that sensitive information remains protected while
    still promoting collaboration and data sharing among authorized stakeholders.
    The work in [112] summarizes a model for better traceability and tamper-proofing
    of remote sensing data changes. It aims to integrate blockchain technology with
    remote sensing data sharing to confirm decentralized, secure, and reliable data
    storage. The model comprises a multichain structure, utilizing a public chain
    to store open data and a summary of federated chain blocks. Fig. 2 depicts crop
    monitoring in agriculture using remote sensing and I5.0. The absence of high bandwidth
    connectivity poses a significant problem in linking with remote sensing devices,
    presenting a critical challenge in agriculture in the era of I5.0. Addressing
    this problem is essential for simplifying the smooth transmission of data from
    various remote sensing devices, including satellites, drones, and ground-based
    sensors. Overcoming this challenge allows real-time monitoring capabilities, permitting
    farmers to promptly receive updates on vital factors such as crop conditions,
    pest infestations, and environmental dynamics. Sharma et al. [113] proposed a
    work that involves the design of a compact antipodal structured antenna for future
    5G broadband applications and upcoming remote sensing satellite links. The stable
    performance of the proposed antenna has made it suitable for deployment in application
    devices. This integrated approach encourages I5.0’s emphasis on seamless connectivity,
    developing a more interconnected and responsive agricultural system. Ranjha et
    al. [114] demonstrate a technique for achieving ultrahigh reliability for short-packet
    communication in UAV-assisted agricultural systems for effective remote sensing
    of crops. The approach uses iterative methods based on perturbation theory to
    improve the system parameters, with simulation results verifying the proposed
    algorithm''s effectiveness. The work aims to allow ultrareliable low-latency communication
    in highly challenging remote sensing scenarios. Sharifi et al. [115] focus on
    field border extraction from satellite images using a convolutional neural network
    that performs multiple semantic segmentation tasks. The model offers high efficiency
    in detecting field borders accurately at both pixel and object levels. The proposed
    approach involves the use of ResUNet-a architecture with multiple convolutions
    to classify features on several scales. The work highlights the importance of
    contextual knowledge at different levels to improve the accuracy of border extraction.
    Shafi et al. [116] make use of IoT, and ML focused on crop health mapping using
    low-altitude remote sensing. Data collected from drone imagery and IoT sensors
    was gathered and used for crop health classification. ML algorithms were applied
    to classify crop health using the fused data. Different classification models
    were used and evaluated, with a model M4 outperforming the rest. C. Water Management
    Water management plays a vital role in achieving sustainable agriculture [117],
    serving as a serious component of the growth and productivity of crops. Efficient
    water management in agriculture comprises the careful planning, distribution,
    and utilization of water resources to optimize crop yields while minimizing waste.
    As the global population continues to increase, the demand for food production
    increases, highlighting the importance of responsible water management practices
    [118]. Farmers and policymakers face the challenge of balancing the demands of
    agriculture with the necessity of preserving water resources for future generations.
    Effective water management not only confirms the economic viability of farming
    but also contributes to environmental sustainability by avoiding the impact of
    water shortages and promoting resilience in the face of changing climate conditions
    [119]. By integrating I5.0, which prioritizes human collaboration and emphasizes
    the interconnection of various stakeholders, stakeholders can work together to
    develop and implement innovative solutions for sustainable water use in agriculture.
    Thus, understanding and implementing sound water management practices are mandatory
    for achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture. Water management
    in agriculture faces significant challenges, including water shortage made worse
    by factors such as climate change and population growth, leading to increased
    competition for limited water resources [120]. In addition, water quality issues
    arise due to pollution from agricultural excess and industrial discharges, raising
    threats to crop health, soil fertility, and ecosystems [121]. Inefficient water
    use, often arising from outdated irrigation practices, contributes to wastage
    and irregular distribution, further increasing competition for water. Climate
    change introduces increased variations in weather patterns, with increased frequency
    and severity of droughts and floods disrupting traditional water management approaches
    [122]. Handling these challenges requires a comprehensive method integrating advanced
    irrigation technologies, sustainable practices, and adaptive strategies to confirm
    the careful and sustainable use of water resources in agriculture, promoting the
    sustainability and resilience of I5.0. Microwave and infrared sensors on satellites
    can calculate soil moisture content, helping farmers and water managers make informed
    decisions about irrigation planning [123]. Deployed ground sensors and satellite
    data can be analyzed using ML to provide real-time information on soil moisture
    levels across large agricultural areas. Das et al. [124] proposed a work that
    involves the development and evaluation of an ML approach for the joint modeling
    of carbon and water fluxes in drylands of the western US using satellite data.
    The work explicitly contains soil moisture in the model and introduces new vegetation
    indices for capturing dryland seasonality demonstrating a form of human–machine
    collaboration through the integration of advanced technologies in agriculture.
    Remote sensing data can be used to assess the efficiency of irrigation systems
    by monitoring changes in soil moisture before and after irrigation. Sensors capable
    of capturing thermal infrared radiation are deployed on various platforms, including
    satellites, drones, and hand-held devices [125]. Thermal infrared imagery can
    help identify areas with water stress, aligning with I5.0’s resilience ability
    in agriculture by allowing farmers to adapt irrigation practices accordingly.
    The work proposed in [126] involves the use of UAVs for precision agriculture
    applications such as tracking crop health, estimating nutrient status, yield,
    and crop water demand. Thermal sensors deployed in the UAVs were used to monitor
    the surface temperature of the crops before and after irrigation to identify plant
    water stress in crops. It supports water management by allowing farmers to make
    timely and effective irrigation decisions. Satellite or drone-based sensors can
    gather data on soil moisture levels, crop health, and weather conditions [127].
    AI algorithms can analyze the remote sensing data to create predictive models
    for soil moisture dynamics [128]. These models allow automated irrigation scheduling
    by taking factors, such as current soil moisture, crop water requirements, and
    upcoming weather conditions. Another interesting work in [129] uses an AI algorithm
    to estimate crop behavior in terms of crop coefficient (Kc) and growth stages
    at the plot level. The work demonstrates improved Kc and growth stage estimation
    compared to experimental Kc protocols, which can help design dynamic irrigation
    management and allocate water between plots in real time. D. Plant Disease Identification
    Plant disease identification in agriculture helps in the identification of crop-damaging
    diseases. Plant disease identification in agriculture is an important part of
    the farming process because correctly and quickly identifying diseases can lead
    to proper treatment, controlling disease spread, and minimizing crop damage. Plant
    disease identification helps in crop yield improvement, food security, and the
    reduction of agricultural economic losses [130]. Identifying a crop''s history
    based on previous disease occurrences and applying advanced disease prevention
    practices can reduce future disease risk. Plant diseases can be avoided by following
    appropriate agricultural practices such as crop rotation, proper irrigation, and
    sanitation. Plant disease can be identified by spots on leaves or fruits, undersized
    growth, color changes, and other abnormal changes in the plant''s exterior parts
    [131]. To provide effective treatment, it is important to identify the germs that
    cause the disease, such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. As medical technology
    advances, samples of the affected plant are sent to a lab for microscopic examination
    for a more accurate diagnosis. Recent technological advances, such as imaging
    technology, remote sensing, and AI, are being useful in identifying plant diseases
    [132]. Remote sensing technology aids in the monitoring of plant diseases and
    pests by identifying plant health from a distance, which is primarily useful for
    large-scale monitoring. This technology provides efficient surveillance for large
    agricultural areas by minimizing time-consuming tasks [133]. Agriculture experts
    can easily identify the specific location and severity of disease and pest infestations
    in crops by analyzing data from remote sensors, which is important for understanding
    the severity of the problem and responding appropriately. Remote sensing technology
    uses live agriculture data, such as optical data, to detect changes in plant health
    that are not visible to the naked eye. It also utilizes fluorescence and thermal
    parameters, which are important in detection and monitoring processes [134]. High-resolution
    images provide detailed information about the landscape, which enables an analysis
    of environmental factors that can influence disease and pest spread. As a result,
    this technology is critical not only for identifying current plant health issues,
    but also for continuously protecting crops from future threats [135]. Although
    remote sensing technology can help in identifying plant diseases and pests, it
    has some limits. One of the most significant challenges is the limited identification
    of certain diseases and pests, particularly those lacking unique, distinct features
    that can be detected by remote sensors [136]. This is particularly challenging
    for soil-borne and root diseases, which frequently cause systemic changes in the
    metabolism of a crop. These changes can be minor and complex, making remote sensing
    technologies difficult to identify. Another significant challenge is ensuring
    the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing data. Accurate and reliable data
    are required for efficient crop preservation, but gaps in sensor performance and
    outside factors can affect data accuracy. Furthermore, existing sensor characteristics
    may limit their ability to detect specific diseases and pests, emphasizing the
    importance of future sensor development [137]. I5.0 plays an important role in
    plant disease identification. The human-centric approach, which is considered
    as an important principle of I5.0, helps in plant disease identification by leveraging
    human knowledge. Accurate disease identification cannot be accomplished solely
    through advanced technology. Skilled humans must be involved in dealing with complex
    or ambiguous scenarios, assessing the significance of symptoms, taking environmental
    factors into account, and determining the status of plant disease conditions [4].
    I5.0 aids in adaptive learning by allowing farmers to interact with AI systems
    and provide feedback. Based on this feedback, the AI systems learn and improve,
    thereby helping in disease identification. The collaborative characteristic of
    I5.0, which combines human expertise and machine productivity, aids in providing
    efficient and environmentally friendly solutions for plant disease identification
    [4]. The use of I5.0 helps in the achievement of sustainable economic practices
    by reducing waste and excess production by recognizing and dealing with plant
    disease spread. Precision agriculture practices, when combined with remote sensing
    and AI, can indicate exactly where and how much treatment is needed, thereby reducing
    chemical usage and the impact on the environment. Predictive analysis aids in
    the prediction and preventive management of plant diseases, thus minimizing the
    need for large amounts of chemical medication and protecting the ecological balance
    [138]. Table IV explains the I5.0 principles for identifying plant diseases, emphasizing
    the importance of technology and human expertise, customized solutions, user-friendly
    designs, and sustainable practices. TABLE IV I5.0 Principles for Plant Disease
    Identification E. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture improves agricultural
    productivity and farming techniques by monitoring and controlling environmental
    variations using modern technology [139]. This method increases productivity by
    optimizing the use of resources such as water, pesticides, and fertilizers based
    on environmental conditions. It also reduces waste, reduces environmental impact,
    and lowers costs by making better use of resources [140]. Precision agriculture
    makes use of data from drones, satellites, and sensors to make decisions and monitor
    crop health. Precision agriculture aids in the detection of plant diseases and
    nutrient deficiencies at an early stage. Furthermore, precision agriculture provides
    a robust system for dealing with weather-related changes, ensuring environmentally
    friendly and productive agriculture. Precision agriculture aids in the monitoring
    of many parameters, including crop irrigation, best sowing stages, and harvesting.
    Precision agriculture also provides accurate crop status information that can
    be acquired via ground and air sources. Remote sensing provides an important role
    in precision agriculture by providing important information for improved agricultural
    management. Remote sensing is useful for optimizing inputs for agriculture, increasing
    crop production, and reducing input waste [103]. Remote sensing applications in
    agriculture provide crop surveillance, irrigation management, precise nutrient
    deployment, disease and pest control, and crop yield estimation. The use of high-definition
    satellite imagery has increased its application in the agriculture field. Furthermore,
    the use of UAVs has improved the effectiveness of remote sensing [141]. Remote
    sensing technology ensures best agricultural practices by providing accurate information,
    resulting in more efficient and environmentally friendly farming methods, emphasizing
    its important role in precision agriculture [142]. The integration of wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) and UAVs improves crop monitoring, agricultural yields,
    production modeling, future predictions, and effective decision. The WSN-UAV-based
    IoT framework provides advantages such as real-time data collection and analysis,
    as well as 3-D modeling of sensor data. Crop monitoring using UAV images can achieve
    a variety of outcomes, including water level monitoring, pesticide levels, and
    identification of diseases. In [143], Abioye et al. proposed a predictive controller
    model for precision irrigation based on discrete Laguerre networks. The proposed
    model employs embedded devices in an IoT platform to monitor water consumption
    at the appropriate time, quantity, and location by monitoring the weather as well
    as controlling soil moisture levels and crop response. When compared to existing
    approaches, the proposed approach reduced water usage by 30% over 21 days. Although
    remote sensing technology in precision agriculture offers advantages, it also
    has some limitations. Interpreting and analyzing the huge quantity of agricultural
    data generated by remote sensing devices necessitates human expertise [144]. Obtaining
    high-resolution and accurate information for specialized agricultural needs is
    one of the most challenging tasks in precision agriculture using remote sensing
    technologies. Purchase and maintenance of modern remote sensing technology, such
    as high-resolution satellites and UAVs, can be expensive, especially for small-scale
    farmers [145]. Environmental factors such as cloud darkness, which can blur satellite
    imagery, and changing weather conditions, which can affect data accuracy, might
    create a negative impact on remote sensing efficiency. Integrating remote sensing
    data into traditional farming systems is a major problem [146]. This integration
    necessitates not just technological data processing and analysis skills but also
    human knowledge and intervention. Farmers and agricultural professionals must
    be able to analyze data in the context of their own farming techniques and situations.
    This needs a combination of scientific expertise and practical agricultural knowledge,
    emphasizing the significance of training and assistance in the efficient use of
    remote sensing in agriculture. The challenges involved in integrating remote sensing
    into precision agriculture highlight the vital role of human involvement and experience.
    Farmers and agricultural workers need both scientific expertise and practical
    application skills to properly use remote sensing data [147]. This is where I5.0
    can make a huge contribution. There is a chance to improve agricultural productivity
    and sustainability by integrating remote sensing technical improvements with the
    human-centric approach of I5.0. This integration can lead to more productive,
    efficient, and environmentally friendly agricultural practices [111]. I5.0 can
    significantly improve precision agriculture by addressing its limitations. The
    human-centric Approach improves precision agriculture by combining human expertise
    with cutting-edge technologies such as AI and remote sensing, ensuring that data
    analysis and decision making are guided by real-time agricultural expertise [148].
    When human knowledge expertise is applied to remote sensing data in agricultural
    tasks, personalized and successful farming practices occur. Training farmers and
    agricultural professionals on how to use advanced technologies results in efficient
    farm management. This method ensures that precision agriculture is not completely
    reliant on technology but also makes use of human expertise and inputs [149].
    In I5.0, sustainability plays an important role in improving precision agriculture
    by encouraging environmentally friendly and resource-effective practices [117].
    Precision agriculture benefits from I5.0 by emphasizing the efficient use of resources
    such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides, reducing waste and environmental harm.
    Precision agriculture contributes to lower greenhouse gas emissions by reducing
    resource overuse and meeting sustainable development goals. I5.0, sustainable
    precision agriculture methods guarantee the long-term health and fertility of
    the soil, saving ecosystems for future generations [21]. This sustainable approach
    in precision agriculture using I5.0 focuses on protecting the environment and
    preserving resources, resulting in more environmentally friendly and productive
    farming. Mass personalization, an important concept in I5.0, significantly improves
    the efficiency, sustainability, and productivity of precision agriculture. Customizing
    agricultural practices and approaches to meet the specific needs of individual
    farms allows for more effective and resource-efficient operations. This personalized
    approach aligns with the goals of sustainable farming, guaranteeing that agricultural
    practices are both environmentally friendly and financially feasible. Table V
    presents precision agriculture utilizing remote sensing and I5.0 to create a sustainable,
    efficient, and resilient agricultural system. TABLE V Precision Agriculture Utilizes
    Remote Sensing and I5.0 to Create a Sustainable, Efficient, and Resilient Agricultural
    System F. Environmental Monitoring Environmental monitoring in agriculture is
    critical for increasing crop yields, ensuring resource sustainability, and reducing
    the effects of climate change and environmental damage caused by farming operations.
    Environmental monitoring helps in monitoring soil health conditions such as nutrient
    levels, pH levels, moisture, and temperature. Monitoring all of these parameters
    helps to understand the soil''s capacity and assists in making decisions regarding
    fertilization, irrigation, and crop rotation [150]. Environmental monitoring methods
    are used to track climate conditions such as temperature, rainfall, humidity,
    and wind patterns. These data are essential for scheduling sowings, irrigation,
    and crop protection during bad weather. Environmental monitoring in agriculture
    helps in determining the quality and quantity of irrigation water. Monitoring
    water sources ensures that crops get enough water without wasting it and reduces
    excessive irrigation, which can help to prevent soil degradation [151]. Diseases
    and pests that harm crops are being monitored for their presence and spread, enabling
    early use of pesticides. Environmental monitoring aids in determining how air
    quality affects crop health. This helps in the identification of harmful pollutants
    that harm crops and reduce their quality. Environmental monitoring in agriculture
    is enhanced by technologies, such as remote sensing, UAVs, and satellite imaging.
    Remote sensing technologies provide detailed information on land topography, soil
    structure, and the plant life that is currently growing in afforestation. Remote
    sensing and satellite imaging can be used to identify appropriate areas for planting,
    track the progress of newly planted areas, and assess forest health periodically.
    These sensing devices provide accurate mapping and analysis, which is essential
    for successful afforestation activities [152]. Remote sensing and satellite imagery
    enable real-time monitoring of deforestation. They detect changes in forest areas,
    identify illegal logging locations, and assist in ensuring that forest conservation
    policies are followed. UAVs aid in the provision of high-resolution images of
    specific areas, allowing for close monitoring and quick response to deforestation
    activities. Remote sensing technologies play an essential role in wildlife conservation
    as they provide accurate environmental monitoring [153]. Satellite and aerial
    imagery provide information about changes in land usage and habitat fragmentation,
    which is important in understanding how agricultural practices affect wildlife.
    Conservation approaches can be developed to protect species in danger and preserve
    biodiversity by monitoring changes in the environment [154]. Satellite imaging
    and UAV technologies are useful for gathering information during monitoring droughts
    and floods. They monitor weather patterns, soil moisture levels, and water availability
    across large areas and provide important forecasting information. These data assist
    farmers in making irrigation, crop selection, and land management decisions, reducing
    the impact of extreme weather on crop yields [155]. Although the use of remote
    sensing has advantages in environmental monitoring, some challenges must be addressed.
    One of the challenges of using remote sensing in environmental monitoring is data
    privacy and security, as the large amount of data provided by remote sensing can
    raise ethical concerns about the use as well as confidentiality, particularly
    in areas resided by local people [156]. Obtaining an appropriate spatial and temporal
    resolution is an enormous challenge [153]. Although high spatial resolution can
    capture accurate images, it may not be practical for constant monitoring. Remote
    sensing generates massive amounts of data, which may be challenging to maintain,
    analyze, and evaluate. Remote sensing data analysis and interpretation require
    specialized human expertise [157]. Data degradation and noise effects are common
    challenges in imaging processes, resulting in inconsistent and low-quality images.
    These issues can be caused by a variety of factors, such as sensor limitations,
    environmental conditions, and computational techniques, requiring advanced noise
    reduction and data correction strategies to ensure accuracy and reliability in
    image analysis and interpretation. Effective mitigation involves utilizing sophisticated
    algorithms and preprocessing techniques to improve data integrity and usability
    [158]. Incorporating local expertise and viewpoints into remote sensing operations
    is critical. It is a significant challenge to make remote sensing data accessible
    and understandable to people without expertise, including local farmers [159].
    Fig. 3 depicts environmental monitoring in agriculture using remote sensing and
    I5.0 principles for sustainable farming. I5.0 helps in accomplishing the goal
    of sustainability in remote sensing and satellite imaging for environmental monitoring.
    Remote sensing and satellite imaging are employed for monitoring deforestation,
    monitoring ocean health, and observing atmospheric changes [160]. The incorporation
    of I5.0 helps in reducing environmental impact while improving data collection
    for environmentally friendly practices [22]. Data analysis experts must be involved
    to understand the complicated remote sensing data. These professionals are skilled
    at analyzing complex data and converting it into formats that the general public
    can understand [161]. Human–machine collaboration is emphasized in I5.0 during
    environmental monitoring. Sensors collect data, AI systems analyze satellite data,
    and then human decisions are made based on the analysis [162]. Human collaboration
    ensures that technology and human intervention achieve effective environmental
    monitoring goals. This approach not only improves monitoring efficiency, but guarantees
    that the knowledge obtained is relevant, accurate, and useful in real-world scenarios.
    Mass personalization and mass customization are important principles of I5.0 that
    aid in environmental monitoring in areas, such as afforestation, deforestation,
    wildlife preservation, and drought and flood monitoring. These principles enable
    personalized solutions to be used in specific environmental conditions and needs,
    enhancing the effectiveness of monitoring [163]. Mass customization in afforestation
    and deforestation allows for the creation of specialized drones and satellite
    imaging technologies that may be customized to different types of forests and
    geographical locations. These devices may be customized to monitor certain tree
    species and detect illegal deforestation. Conservation measures become more efficient
    when these technologies are customized for specific ecosystems. For wildlife preservation,
    I5.0 helps in providing customized tracking systems and sensors that cater to
    the specific habits and needs of different wildlife species [20]. This personalization
    ensures that monitoring efforts are nonintrusive and highly effective, leading
    to better understanding and protection of animal populations. It also facilitates
    the development of personalized conservation strategies that address the unique
    challenges faced by each species. This approach not only increases the effectiveness
    of conservation measures but also ensures that these efforts are customized to
    the specific needs and challenges of various wildlife preservation efforts [164].
    When dealing with natural disasters such as droughts and floods, mass personalization
    enhances the effectiveness of monitoring and response systems. Weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, and water flows in specific regions can be closely monitored
    using customized sensor networks and forecasting techniques. This approach improves
    the accuracy of early warning systems [165]. AI integration in remote sensing
    [166] discusses the use of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation in
    land cover classification in urban environments. It targets both individual environments
    and multiregion/urban city scenarios. The work involves the development and application
    of multimodal AI models to process and understand diverse remote sensing data
    for land cover segmentation. The study highlights the importance of generalization
    ability across different urban environments and addresses the challenges and potential
    future solutions in the field chosen. G. Soil Health Monitoring Soil health monitoring
    in agriculture is a methodical and extensive process that entails regular assessment
    and analysis of diverse soil properties and indicators to assess the overall fertility,
    structure, and biological activity of the soil. This proactive strategy is essential
    for fostering sustainability and productivity in farming, offering crucial insights
    into nutrient levels, microbial diversity, and potential soil limitations [167].
    The significance of soil health monitoring lies in its ability to guide precision
    agriculture, empowering farmers to optimize resource management, boost crop productivity,
    and mitigate environmental impacts [168]. The article also discusses the need
    for soil health monitoring, highlighting its pivotal role in optimizing crop productivity,
    minimizing environmental impacts, and fostering sustainable resource management.
    Additionally, this survey delves into the multifaceted benefits, including informed
    decision-making for farmers and land managers, improved nutrient management, and
    enhanced soil structure. The challenges encountered in soil health monitoring
    for agriculture are several and intricate. According to Silva et al. [169], the
    limited accessibility and affordability of advanced monitoring technologies pose
    significant hurdles, a sentiment echoed by Usman et al. [170], who highlight the
    spatial and temporal variability of soil properties as additional obstacles to
    obtaining accurate and representative data. The complexity of soil ecosystems,
    emphasized by Reddy et al. [171], necessitates nuanced models to capture dynamic
    interactions while Bagnall et al. [172] point out that the lack of standardized
    protocols contributes to inconsistencies in data interpretation. Ethical concerns
    regarding data privacy and ownership, as discussed by multiple sources, further
    complicate the collection and sharing of soil health information. To establish
    an effective and sustainable soil health monitoring process, addressing challenges
    such as integrating stakeholder input, ensuring long-term commitment, and overcoming
    resource constraints is important. Challenges arise from the limited spatial and
    spectral resolutions of remote sensing data, creating difficulties in capturing
    fine-scale variations in soil properties as highlighted by Debangshi et al. [173].
    Moreover, atmospheric interference, including clouds and aerosols, can impede
    the reliable acquisition of data, thereby impacting the accuracy of soil health
    assessments according to Deshpande and Inamdar [174]. The complexity of calibrating
    and validating remote sensing models for soil health parameters persists due to
    the dynamic nature of soil properties and the requisite ground truth data, as
    observed by Pande and Moharir [103]. Additionally, the high initial costs associated
    with obtaining and maintaining remote sensing technology may serve as a deterrent
    to widespread adoption, particularly in resource-constrained agricultural settings
    as noted by Sadenova et al. [175]. Overcoming these challenges is crucial to unlocking
    the full potential of remote sensing for soil health monitoring and advancing
    sustainable agricultural practices. I5.0 has the potential to revolutionize soil
    health monitoring in agriculture by harnessing remote sensing data and integrating
    cutting-edge technologies for data acquisition, processing, and analysis. The
    application of agricultural remote sensing, utilizing sensors such as SAR, NIR,
    LiDAR, and multispectral imaging, allows for nondestructive, large-scale observation
    of crops and soil conditions. Martos et al. [4] highlight that this approach provides
    high-resolution data, facilitating accurate assessments of soil health. To address
    challenges associated with model calibration and validation, as noted by Chmielewski
    et al. [176], these technologies significantly enhance the precision of soil health
    assessments. Moreover, the deployment of remote sensing technologies, particularly
    through UAVs and robotic process automation (RPAs), has demonstrated promise in
    soil analysis and disease surveillance, aligning with the principles of Agriculture
    5.0 outlined by Reid and Castka [177]. This technological integration supports
    sustainable agricultural resource management. The synergy of remote sensing and
    data analytics not only boosts the efficiency of soil health monitoring but also
    contributes to the overall sustainability and productivity of agricultural practices.
    I5.0 emphasizes the development of cost-effective solutions and widespread accessibility
    of technologies, ensuring that even farmers in resource-constrained settings can
    adopt remote sensing tools for soil health monitoring. This inclusive approach
    fosters a more sustainable and productive agricultural landscape, aligning with
    the vision presented by Diaz-Gonzalez et al. [178]. H. Agriculture Education Agricultural
    education encompasses structured and methodical guidance, instruction, and training
    provided to students, farmers, or individuals keen on delving into the realms
    of agriculture, spanning the science, business, and technology associated with
    both animal and plant production. This educational framework also extends to the
    management of the environment and natural resources. Its significance in contemporary
    society and for future generations is underscored for various reasons, such as
    increasing self-sustainability, stimulating interest in agriculture, promoting
    sustainable and responsible agricultural practices, enhancing food security, etc.
    [179], [180]. Agricultural education faces challenges associated with persistent
    stereotypes and misconceptions about the field, limiting its attractiveness and
    recognition. The stereotype that agriculture solely involves traditional farming
    practices can restrict the scope of agricultural education [181]. The lack of
    motivation to establish agricultural education programs is another challenge,
    as the misconception that agriculture is not a viable career path leads to a lack
    of interest in offering these programs [182]. Difficulty in aligning agricultural
    education courses with key graduation requirements can impede student enrollment.
    This challenge highlights the need for flexible curricula that meet both educational
    standards and the evolving needs of the agricultural sector [183]. Teachers must
    have the minimum enrollment needed to continue teaching their course content,
    which can be challenging in some cases [181]. Addressing these challenges is essential
    for the continued success and relevance of agricultural education programs and
    the overall well-being of the agricultural sector. I5.0 enables the use of remote
    sensing data in agriculture, which provides extensive coverage and highly accurate
    information about land cover, land use changes, and soil erosion, allowing for
    precise monitoring and management of soil health attributes [165]. These data
    can be correlated to soil health attributes measured in the field, further enhancing
    its reliability and effectiveness in soil monitoring [4]. Remote sensing in agriculture
    has been used to guide the application of fertilizer, pesticides, and other farm
    inputs, with benefits such as improved crop yield and reduced environmental impacts
    [184]. The integration of I5.0 and remote sensing into agricultural education
    programs allows students to gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness
    of various agricultural practices and the impact of these practices on the environment,
    ultimately leading to more informed and effective future farmers and leaders in
    the agricultural sector [185]. By incorporating remote sensing data into agricultural
    education programs, students can gain a deeper understanding of the importance
    of agriculture and natural resource management [186]. The use of remote sensing
    technology in agricultural education has the potential to revolutionize the agricultural
    sector by promoting sustainable practices, enhancing food security, and developing
    a strong connection between urban and rural communities [165], [185]. I. Livestock
    Management Livestock management in agriculture involves the care and handling
    of domesticated animals for the production of meat, milk, eggs, and other by-products.
    It encompasses various aspects such as basic husbandry, animal health and nutrition,
    pasture management, organic farming, economic sustainability, and sustainable
    food systems [187]. Livestock management is essential for sustainable agriculture
    and offers several benefits, including providing income, food, manure, fuel, and
    transport, contributing to the global value of agricultural output, supporting
    the livelihoods of smallholders and agribusiness, and promoting sustainable agriculture
    practices [188]. Proper livestock management practices can ensure that feed nutrients
    are not wasted, feed efficiency is optimized, and animal welfare is maintained.
    Livestock management is crucial for the production of high-quality food, the economic
    sustainability of farming communities, and the overall development of sustainable
    agriculture practices [189]. Livestock management in agriculture faces several
    challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the sustainability and profitability
    of livestock farming. Proper animal feeding and management practices are essential
    for optimizing feed and nutrient use, preventing waste, and avoiding overfeeding
    [190]. Nutrient management on livestock farms is crucial to ensure that inputs
    such as feed, animals, and bedding are balanced with outputs such as meat, milk,
    and manure. When inputs exceed plant and animal requirements for nutrients, losses
    can occur, leading to excess nutrients stored in the soil, which may result in
    environmental issues such as nutrient leaching and soil surface runoff [191].
    In addition, livestock management requires skills, such as basic husbandry, nutrition,
    communication, preparation, adaptation, and evaluation [192], [193]. Clear communication
    and adaptation are essential for managing livestock, as producers need to adapt
    to fluctuating markets, variable seasonal factors, and declining terms of trade
    [194]. Furthermore, environmental sustainability is a significant challenge in
    livestock management, as the sector must balance the need for agricultural output
    with the environmental impact of livestock farming, including greenhouse gas emissions,
    land degradation, and water consumption [195]. Addressing these challenges requires
    a collaborative effort from farmers, researchers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers
    to develop innovative solutions and best practices for sustainable and profitable
    livestock management in agriculture. The adoption of I5.0 technologies, such as
    remote sensing data, can significantly enhance livestock management in agriculture
    [196], [197]. Remote sensing technology provides valuable information on animal
    welfare, grazing lands, and environmental sustainability, which can assist in
    monitoring herd movement, vegetation conditions, water availability, and weather
    [198], [199]. It can also be used to develop quantitative risk management strategies.
    The incorporation of sensor technology, encompassing on-animal sensors, environmental
    monitoring tools, and remote sensing, has the capacity to transition livestock
    operations from a conventional, reactive, knowledge-driven model to a proactive,
    data-centric decision-making approach [200], [201], [202]. The substantial potential
    lies in employing remote and on-animal sensing to enhance both the production
    and welfare of grazing livestock while also significantly improving landscape
    management. SECTION IV. Challenges and Future Directions Despite the advancements
    brought out by the I5.0 industrial revolution, still challenges persist in the
    realm of agricultural remote sensing. This section investigates the challenges
    that persist, exploring the complexities and hurdles faced even after the integration
    of I5.0 technologies in agricultural remote sensing. Fig. 5 depicts the challenges
    and future directions in integrating remote sensing and I5.0 technologies in agriculture.
    Fig. 5. Challenges and future directions in integrating remote sensing and I5.0
    technologies in agriculture. Show All A. Security and Privacy Concerns 1) Threats
    Related to Data Security Sensitive data obtained from the field have the potential
    threat of unauthorized access from hackers or market competitors. While transmission
    of remote sensing data, there is a possibility of interception by malicious intruders,
    leading to data breaches. For instance, data transmission between sensors, networks,
    and platforms may not have sufficient encryption, making it vulnerable to interception
    and unauthorized access [203]. 2) Threats Related to Network Security The communication
    channels used for transmitting remote sensing data may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
    This may lead to data manipulation or disruption of services. Lack or weakness
    in the fundamental infrastructure supporting remote sensing systems can be exploited
    to compromise data integrity and availability [204]. 3) Threats Related to Device
    Security Data collected from farms through deployed sensors, networks, and cloud
    platforms in the era of I5.0 are highly vulnerable to hacking, malware, and ransomware
    attacks, potentially losing control over data integrity, confidentiality, and
    availability [205]. Security vulnerabilities in these devices may lead to unauthorized
    access to sensitive information. For instance, sensors deployed in the field may
    encounter the risk of physical accessibility, making them vulnerable to tampering,
    damage, or theft, eventually leading to compromised data accuracy and possible
    disruptions to the system [206]. 4) Threats Related to Privacy Farmers face potential
    issues with the ownership and control of their data. This includes risks associated
    with location tracking and the collection of personal information [207]. Informed
    consent becomes crucial to address privacy worries, confirming that farmers are
    sufficiently informed about the gathering and utilization of their data. Development
    in spatial resolution of satellite imagery can create a risk of privacy violation.
    This means that remote sensing satellites through high spatial resolution technology
    can provide information to a wide range of people in real-time, leading to crucial
    privacy protection issues for remote sensing data [208]. 5) Future Directions
    Making use of I5.0’s technologies can help mitigate security threats in remote
    sensing. Employ robust cloud security schemes, including data encryption, access
    controls, and frequent security audits. Deploying edge computing to process sensitive
    data closer to the source can help mitigate the movement of data. This can aid
    in improving data security. In addition, integrate blockchain to create an immutable
    record of data transactions to add additional layer of security. Establish clear
    privacy policies and regulations for the collection, storage, and use of agricultural
    data. Implement anonymization and aggregation methods to protect individual farmer
    information [209]. Implement suitable security measures that address the interconnected
    nature of I5.0 systems. Conduct complete risk assessments and adopt a holistic
    approach to security. B. Real-Time Data Processing 1) Threats Related to Investment
    and Returns The challenges in constructing IoT infrastructure for continuous monitoring
    and real-time processing, mainly in open-field agriculture, include the significant
    tradeoff between massive investments and low returns in rural areas [210]. 2)
    Threats Related to Accumulation, Storage, and Processing of Massive Amounts of
    Data Another crucial challenge is technology adoption, which will give rise to
    an increase in data volume and complexity in management. Additionally, the challenges
    in data storage, computation, and data management related to I/O operations and
    applications will become serious issues in remote sensing [4]. For instance, a
    remote sensing system has to accumulate thermal imaging sensor data for various
    studies related to agriculture, such as crop stress, water and nutrient deficiency,
    and herbicide resistance. This sensing system monitors crop acreage change, yield,
    production, growth, drought, and other agro-information and communicates it to
    government ministries and other agricultural sectors. This indicates that the
    real-time process threats pertain to the challenges related to the accumulation,
    storage, and processing of large volumes of remote sensing data for agricultural
    monitoring and management. 3) Threats Related to Technology Traditional satellite
    remote sensing systems face challenges in meeting the real-time processing and
    intelligent service demands for satellite remote sensing imagery [126]. This includes
    challenges such as the inability to meet the massification and real-time application
    needs of satellite remote sensing imagery and the urgent need to develop intelligent
    satellite systems to resolve these issues. 4) Threats Related to Cloud Cover Cloud
    cover obstructs the transmission of EM radiation, diminishing the ability of remote
    sensing systems to capture clear images or data. The presence of cloud cover introduces
    interference that compromises the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing measurements
    by attenuating or distorting signals received from the Earth''s surface. Interesting
    work [211] discusses advancements in cloud detection for remote sensing images.
    They introduce RD-UNet, a deep learning model, showing superiority over current
    methods. Another research effort [212] focuses on cloud removal in remote sensing
    images using deep learning methods. Traditional methods such as exemplar-based
    and information cloning show inconsistencies in feature reconstruction. The proposed
    method, GAN-CA, U-Net, Shift-Net, and SAR-opt-GAN, outperforms traditional methods
    in reconstructing ground objects accurately. 5) Future Directions The development
    of intelligent remote sensing satellite systems in I5.0 is vital to address on-orbit
    processing and intelligent service issues. Additionally, I5.0’s technological
    advancements in cloud computing and wireless technologies are expected to help
    process remote sensing data quickly after acquisition, ultimately combining automation
    and computational resources to create intelligent technologies for AI and real-time
    processing for decision-making tools [4]. Edge intelligence can be deployed to
    meet the effective real-time processing requirements of typical applications for
    future intelligent remote sensing satellites [213]. C. Data Variety and Standardization
    1) Threats Multimodal data fusion in remote sensing presents numerous challenges
    [214]. One challenge is the integration of data from diverse sources and sensors,
    which may have varying resolutions, spectral ranges, and spatial and temporal
    coverages. Another challenge is the requirement for methods to integrate and analyze
    the different types of data in a way that maximizes supplements and provides a
    much better description of the context captured [215]. Additionally, addressing
    unforeseen problems and exploring the capabilities of the data provided in the
    framework of contests can also be crucial challenges. Satellite-based sensing
    includes data with the following characteristics multisource, multiscale, high-dimensional,
    dynamic-state, isomer, and nonlinear [216]. These data are high-dimensional with
    many spectral bands and long-time-series data, which offers challenges for analysis.
    The dynamic state of the data includes changes in the Earth''s surface and the
    movements of satellites. There is a requirement to consider scale effects in data
    analysis and processing due to the multiscale characteristic. Spectral variability
    is another crucial challenge in remote sensing. The work in [158] focuses on remote
    sensing, image analysis, and data fusion. It includes the use of ML, signal processing,
    and data science for global urban mapping. The researchers have created models
    for spectral variability and endmember extraction, with a special application
    focus on global urban mapping. The work also comprises the use of Gaussian fields
    to satisfy certain conditions, and the development of perturbed linear mixing
    models to account for spectral variability. These challenges demonstrate the complexities
    and opportunities for research in the field of multimodal data fusion in remote
    sensing. 2) Future Directions Multimodality in remote sensing and data fusion
    can be handled by addressing challenges related to data acquisition from different
    sources coming in different formats, such as the need for converting data into
    common formats for processing, validation of results, and computational load.
    Addressing this challenge requires a multidisciplinary approach involving expertise
    in remote sensing, cutting-edge technologies, and domain-specific knowledge. Current
    research and advancements in these areas contribute to the development of more
    effective solutions for multimodal remote sensing applications. D. Interoperability
    Issues Interoperability issues arise in agriculture, particularly when remote
    sensing and I5.0 are integrated. Some of the most important issues must be addressed
    for successful agricultural practices. 1) Standardization of Data and Protocols
    Agriculture tools and remote sensing technologies are frequently manufactured
    by different companies, each working with unique exclusive processes and standards.
    This lack of standardization makes it difficult to guarantee proper integration
    and successful data exchange between devices and platforms [217]. 2) Complex Data
    Management and Data Analysis The huge volume of data generated by remote sensing
    technologies necessitates advanced data processing techniques and analysis tools.
    Integration of these tools with I5.0 tends to be challenging. This causes problems
    with effectively utilizing data for decision making and has an impact on the accuracy
    of results produced by remote sensing data [218]. 3) Real-Time Data Processing
    and Optimal Response Data generated by satellite imagery, UAVs, and remote sensing
    devices requires quick analysis and responsiveness in the I5.0 environment, which
    is important for effective agricultural management. This quick data processing
    enables timely monitoring of crop health, soil conditions, and environmental factors
    in I5.0. Considering advances in I5.0, current systems struggle with real-time
    data handling and quick decision-making [219]. 4) Future Directions Standardization
    of data and protocols can be accomplished through collaborative efforts between
    technology vendors, standardization organizations, and agricultural stakeholders.
    Manufacturers of agricultural tools and remote sensing technologies must collaborate
    to develop common standards. This collaboration would guarantee that their products
    are interoperable and can communicate efficiently. Farmers and agricultural businesses
    should engage actively in the standardization approach. Handling complex data
    management and achieving optimal responses can be solved by using advanced analytics
    and ML algorithms to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of remote sensing
    data. Edge computing can be used to process data while reducing latency and bandwidth.
    To manage the massive volume of data, automated tools for data cleaning and preprocessing
    can be used. E. Data Accuracy and Calibration The integration of remote sensing
    and I5.0 in agriculture poses several challenges in achieving data accuracy and
    calibration. 1) Sensor Calibration and Validation It is essential to ensure that
    remote sensing devices are accurately calibrated. Calibration is required to ensure
    that the sensors produce accurate data because it has a significant effect on
    the quality and reliability of the data collected [220]. Sensors can crash or
    be damaged over a period of time, reducing their accuracy. Calibration and validation
    of sensor data must be done regularly because it can affect accuracy and generate
    incorrect data. 2) Data Fusion and Integration Data integration from various sensors
    (e.g., satellite, UAV, and ground-based sensors) can be challenging [221]. It
    is challenging to integrate the data from these sensors into a precise model as
    they may have different resolutions, scales, and measurements. 3) Environmental
    Influences External factors such as weather conditions, atmospheric interference,
    and seasonal changes affect the accuracy of agricultural remote sensing data [222].
    These factors generate noise and distortions, which have an impact on the reliability
    of the data collected. 4) Future Directions Sensor calibration depends on sensor
    type, usage intensity, and the environment to which the sensors are exposed, so
    a regular sensor calibration schedule is essential. Setting up automated calibration
    systems, which can continuously monitor sensor performance and update calibration
    parameters in real-time to ensure accuracy. Remote calibration techniques must
    be provided for sensors that are difficult to access, such as satellite sensors.
    Applying advanced data fusion algorithms to effectively integrate data from multiple
    sources. Geospatial information systems aid in the integration and analysis of
    spatial data from various sources. Developing and using sensors that are resistant
    to environmental influences. The use of advanced image processing techniques such
    as image sharpening, contrast adjustment, and AI-based filtering techniques helps
    in improving the quality of images that are affected by environmental conditions.
    F. Connectivity and Latency Integrating remote sensing with I5.0 in agriculture
    poses several challenges, particularly in terms of connectivity and latency. 1)
    Limited Network Infrastructure Many agricultural areas, especially those in remote
    or rural areas, have inadequate network infrastructure [223]. Large amounts of
    data generated by remote sensing technologies are difficult to transmit due to
    a lack of infrastructure. 2) High Bandwidth Requirements Remote sensing technologies,
    such as drones or satellite imagery, generate huge amounts of data [224]. Real-time
    data transmission necessitates high-bandwidth networks, which might not be feasible
    in all agricultural regions. 3) Latency Issues It is essential for precision agriculture
    to capture real-time data, send, and process data in a shorter amount of time
    [225]. However, due to the physical distance between the sensors (in the field)
    and the data processing centers, there may be a huge latency delay. This delay
    may have an impact on decision-making processes that rely on real-time data. 4)
    Future Directions Deploying satellite internet enables network coverage in inaccessible
    regions where traditional connectivity is unavailable. It provides a solution
    for delivering remote sensing data from fields to data processing centers. The
    use of low Earth orbit satellites offers lower latency and higher bandwidth than
    conventional geostationary satellites, making them useful for agricultural remote
    sensing applications. Data compression techniques can be used to reduce the amount
    of data that must be transmitted. Since the data are compressed, less bandwidth
    is required for transmission, making it useful in remote areas with limited network
    capacity. Upgrading network infrastructure to 5G and beyond, enabling faster data
    transmission. Edge computing facilitates data processing and analysis at the edge
    of the network. Only essential and processed data will be sent to central servers.
    This method significantly reduces the amount of data that must be transmitted
    across the network. G. Regulatory Compliance 1) Risk Management and Environmental
    Regulations The integration of advanced technologies in agriculture requires careful
    management of risk and adherence to environmental regulations, which can impose
    compliance costs and burdens on farmers. Future directions in this area may involve
    the development of new technologies and processes that minimize environmental
    impact and promote sustainable farming practices. 2) WTO Rules and Regulations
    Compliance with World Trade Organization rules and regulations poses a demanding
    challenge for countries, affecting the agro-industry and agricultural production.
    Future directions in this area may involve the development of new trade agreements
    and frameworks that support the integration of I5.0 technologies in agriculture.
    3) Food Safety and Quality Standards The use of robotics and advanced technologies
    in food processing necessitates adherence to complex food safety and quality standards,
    adding to the regulatory challenges faced by I5.0 in agriculture. Future directions
    in this area may involve the development of new technologies and processes that
    improve food safety and quality while reducing compliance costs for farmers. 4)
    Labor Laws and Regulations The increasing use of automation and robotics in agriculture
    requires careful consideration of labor laws and regulations to ensure fairness
    for workers and compliance with evolving work practices. Future directions in
    this area may involve the development of new regulations and frameworks that support
    the integration of I5.0 technologies while protecting workers'' rights [117].
    5) Data Privacy and Security The integration of digital technologies in agriculture
    raises concerns about data privacy and security, necessitating the development
    of robust regulations to protect sensitive information. Future directions in this
    area may involve the development of new data privacy and security frameworks that
    support the integration of I5.0 technologies while protecting farmers'' and consumers''
    data [226]. H. Skill and Knowledge Gaps 1) Skewed Focus and Limited Awareness
    There is a skewed focus toward commercial agriculture, and limited awareness and
    understanding of the vast opportunities in agri-business, leading to a lack of
    interest in agricultural careers and study directions. The future direction is
    to change perceptions through public–private collaboration and government intervention.
    2) Data-Driven Development and Career Paths The industry faces challenges in data-driven
    development and the need to develop career development paths that align with the
    requirements of I5.0. Future direction focuses on developing training programs
    that focus on data analytics, ML, and other I5.0 technologies that can equip the
    workforce with the necessary skills [117]. 3) Soft Skills and Development The
    importance of soft skills, now addressed as the soft skill gap in the labor market,
    is increasingly recognized under the conditions of I5.0. Focused efforts on developing
    soft skills are needed. Incorporating soft skill development into agricultural
    education and training programs can help bridge the soft skill gap and prepare
    the workforce for effective human–machine collaboration [227]. 4) Integration
    of Broader Skill Set There is a need to integrate a broader skill set into discipline-specific
    agricultural degrees to meet the specific challenges posed by I5.0. This includes
    skills beyond traditional agriculture, such as data-driven development and human–machine
    collaboration. In the future, integrating a broader skill set into agricultural
    degrees, including skills from fields such as data science, automation, and AI,
    can prepare graduates for the interdisciplinary demands of I5.0 [117], [228].
    5) Public–Private Collaboration and Government Intervention Effective public–private
    collaboration and government intervention are essential to reduce skill gaps and
    change perceptions about agricultural careers. Private industry involvement is
    crucial for providing the required skills, experience, and funding. In future,
    encouraging collaboration between the agricultural industry, government agencies,
    and educational institutions can facilitate the development of relevant training
    programs and address skill gaps. 6) Industry–Academia Linkage Close collaboration
    between the agricultural industry and academia is crucial for developing relevant
    training programs that impart the skills demanded by I5.0. In the future, promoting
    continuous learning and upskilling opportunities for the agricultural workforce
    can ensure that they remain adaptable and proficient in the face of technological
    advancements. I. Costs and ROI 1) High Initial Investment The adoption of I5.0
    technologies, such as AI, IoT sensors, and automation systems, requires a significant
    upfront investment, which can be a barrier for many agricultural businesses, especially
    small and medium-sized farms. Governments can provide financial incentives, grants,
    and subsidies to encourage farmers to adopt I5.0 technologies. This can help offset
    the high initial investment costs and reduce the financial risks associated with
    these technologies. 2) Uncertain Return on Investment The return on investment
    (ROI) for I5.0 technologies in agriculture is often uncertain and can vary depending
    on factors such as the specific technology, the size and type of farm, and market
    conditions. This uncertainty can make it difficult for farmers to justify the
    initial investment. Collaboration between the agricultural industry, government
    agencies, and research institutions can facilitate the development of affordable
    and accessible I5.0 technologies tailored to the specific needs of the agricultural
    sector. 3) Lack of Technical Expertise Implementing and maintaining I5.0 technologies
    requires specialized technical expertise, which may not be readily available in
    the agricultural sector. This can lead to additional costs for training and support.
    In the future, investing in education and training programs can help farmers and
    agricultural professionals develop the technical skills and knowledge necessary
    to implement and manage I5.0 technologies effectively [229]. 4) Data Security
    and Privacy Concerns The use of digital technologies in agriculture generates
    large amounts of data, raising concerns about data security and privacy. Ensuring
    the protection of sensitive data can involve additional costs and resources.Encouraging
    data sharing and collaboration among farmers, researchers, and technology providers
    can help accelerate the development of more effective and efficient I5.0 solutions
    for agriculture [230]. 5) Limited Infrastructure The successful implementation
    of I5.0 technologies often relies on reliable and high-speed internet connectivity,
    which may not be available in all agricultural areas. This lack of infrastructure
    can hinder the adoption of these technologies. Expanding access to reliable and
    high-speed internet connectivity in rural areas is crucial for enabling the adoption
    of I5.0 technologies in agriculture [20]. SECTION V. Case Studies Brazil''s coffee
    supply chain was equipped with a remote sensing-based monitoring system to deal
    with issues related to efficiency and quality control [231]. It collects extensive
    data on crop health and field conditions through spectral sensors, drones, and
    satellite photos. Real-time tracking, precision farming, production forecasting,
    quality assurance, and transparency are some of the benefits obtained through
    this system. Through the use of sustainable techniques, the results demonstrated
    a remarkable decrease in resource usage, noticeable increase in production, greater
    consistency of quality, and improved brand recognition. Another case study that
    demonstrates how environment monitoring can be enhanced through the adoption of
    technology integration is how grape health is getting tracked in California''s
    Napa Valley with remote sensing that combines data from drones and satellites
    [232]. It handles issues such as nutrient shortages, disease outbreaks, and water
    stress. Cost-effective and sustainable practices are made possible by remote sensing,
    which also makes precision agriculture, yield prediction, and early detection
    and reaction possible. However, issues such as cloud cover and data interpretation
    continue to persist, highlighting the necessity for knowledge and reliable infrastructure.
    A precision agriculture experiment was conducted in a Spanish vineyard with seven
    treatments involving different water regimes and fertilization methods [233].
    The vineyard, planted with the Bobal grape variety, had a specific irrigation
    system and soil type. Aerial images were taken using a drone with multispectral
    capabilities to assess crop health. Weather conditions and water status were monitored
    to adjust irrigation schedules. The yield was measured at harvest time to evaluate
    the impact of the treatments on grape production. Another case study made by researchers
    used satellite and airborne sensors of varying resolutions to study coastal wetlands
    [234]. They tracked changes in vegetation, hydrology, and land cover over time.
    The study focused on mapping and monitoring long-term trends and short-term changes
    in wetlands. Recommendations suggested using medium-resolution sensors for large
    areas and high-resolution sensors for critical areas. Multispectral imagery was
    preferred, with hyperspectral imagery for specific cases. Airborne digital camera
    imagery helped interpret satellite images. LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery combined
    improved wetland species discrimination and understanding of topography. The study
    observed changes in land cover, buffer degradation, wetland loss, invasive species
    expansion, and biomass change. The study highlighted the importance of site visits
    in conjunction with remote sensing for accurate mapping of coastal wetlands. Another
    research study has made an effort to optimize nitrogen utilization in winter wheat
    fields of small to medium size in Switzerland [235]. Employing remote sensing
    technology, particularly UAVs equipped with multispectral cameras, allowed for
    the capture of detailed crop field imagery. Various indices were analyzed. Among
    various indices examined, the normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE) demonstrated
    the strongest correlation with both nitrogen uptake and crop nitrogen status.
    Utilizing NDRE values in conjunction with soil nitrogen mineralization data and
    established fertilization guidelines, personalized nitrogen fertilization maps
    were created. These maps provided precise guidance for applying nitrogen fertilizer
    at variable rates across the fields. By adopting this tailored approach, nitrogen
    input was reduced by 5% to 40% compared to conventional fertilization methods,
    all while maintaining crop yield levels. SECTION VI. Conclusion Based on the comprehensive
    survey presented, it is evident that remote sensing technologies have immense
    potential to transform and enhance agricultural practices in the era of I5.0.
    I5.0 marks the next phase in industrial development, characterized by the amalgamation
    of cutting-edge technologies including AI, to create highly intelligent and interconnected
    systems. Our survey demonstrates how advanced technologies such as AI, ML, and
    Big Data analytics can be integrated with remote sensing data to provide actionable
    and timely insights to various agriculture stakeholders. The implementation such
    technologies will revolutionize remote sensing in agriculture facilitating more
    accurate, timely, and data-oriented decision-making processes, thus leading to
    more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices, ultimately enhancing productivity
    and ensuring food security. However, for widespread adoption across the agriculture
    sector, some key challenges need to be addressed. These include lack of awareness
    among farmers, high costs and complexity of solutions, lack of technical expertise,
    concerns around data privacy and security as well as compatibility issues arising
    from the use of multiple data formats and systems. Overcoming these barriers through
    collaborative efforts between technology providers, research institutions, governmental
    agencies and farming communities will likely accelerate adoption. Overall, the
    smart integration of advanced I5.0 technologies and agricultural remote sensing
    has the potential to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive.
    Realizing this potential will play a crucial role in addressing rising food demands
    and environmental pressures in the future. Authors Figures References Keywords

    Things in Agriculture Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Agriculture has long been
    the cornerstone of human civilization, providing sustenance, livelihoods, and
    economic prosperity to communities around the world. However, the global agricultural
    landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting both unprecedented challenges and exciting
    opportunities. As the world''s population continues to surge towards an estimated
    9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for food, fiber, and bioenergy is intensifying
    [1, 2]. This surge in demand, coupled with the increasingly volatile climate and
    resource constraints, necessitates a profound transformation in how we practice
    agriculture. The answer to this challenge lies in the convergence of cutting-edge
    technologies, notably Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), which collectively form the bedrock of what is now known as “Smart Agriculture”
    or “Precision Agriculture” [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Smart Agriculture represents a paradigm
    shift from traditional farming methods to a data-driven, interconnected, and intelligent
    approach to cultivation. It harnesses the power of AI, data analytics, automation,
    and IoT to optimize agricultural processes, conserve resources, enhance crop yields,
    and mitigate environmental impacts [8,9,10,11,12]. This chapter embarks on a journey
    into the realm of AI and smart technologies within the context of agriculture.
    It explores how these technologies are reshaping the agricultural landscape, from
    the vast fields of staple crops to the intricate networks of urban vertical farms.
    It examines the key applications of AI and smart technologies in precision farming,
    highlights real-world case studies of their implementation, and considers the
    implications for farmers, consumers, and the environment. In an age where information
    is a critical resource, the fusion of AI and agriculture represents a pivotal
    moment in human history. It offers the promise of feeding a burgeoning global
    population sustainably, reducing the ecological footprint of agriculture, and
    enhancing the resilience of food systems in the face of climate change. Yet, it
    also raises questions about data security, privacy, and equitable access to these
    transformative technologies. As we embark on this exploration of AI and smart
    technologies in agriculture, we must recognize that we are at the cusp of a new
    agricultural revolution. The seeds of innovation have been sown, and it is our
    responsibility to nurture this burgeoning field to ensure a greener, more abundant,
    and more technologically advanced future of agriculture [13,14,15]. “Precision
    agriculture is an approach to farm management that uses information technology
    (IT) to ensure that crop and soil receive exactly wat they need for optimum health
    and productivity. The goal of PA is to ensure profitability, sustainability and
    protection of the environment” (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Agriculture system Full size image
    “PA is also known as satellite agriculture as needed farming and site-specific
    crop management (SSCM). Modern farming has involved since the day of horse/bullock
    drawn plough. According to Taro Mieno, Assistant Professor, Department of agriculture
    and economics, university of Nebraska. Lincoln, dedicated research worker showed
    the impact of adopting precision technology on farms. Mieno’s research focuses
    specifically on how precision agriculture technologies impact profitability for
    farmers. PA recognizes the diversity of characteristics within a field through
    technology. Some examples of precision agriculture include drones, Global Positioning
    system (GPS) and irrigation technologies [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. The goal of
    precision agriculture is to learn new management practices to increase the profitability
    of agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop low-cost technologies,
    so that the farmers of developing countries may also be benefited by high level
    technologies. 2 Types of Precision Agriculture Precision AG’s editor Eric sfiligoy
    has prepared a list of the top 10 technologies that are shaping precision precision
    agriculture today. Most involve some level of robotics, navigation, sensors and
    variable rate dispensing (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Precision agricultural cycle Full size
    image 1. GPS/GNSS: Its hard to tell exactly where the state of precision agriculture
    today would be without GPS-literally. From virtually movement agriculture gained
    access to position locating satellites in the 1990’s, operators and manufactures
    have found out various ways to the tie into the tools to make managing field work
    much easier and accurate. In North America and Europe, grower can turn on the
    tractors and get to work almost immediately, says T.J.Schulte, marketing manager
    for trimble agriculture Division. Looking beyond these caopabilities, experts
    say that satellite technology is truly deserving of its “global” monitor. “No
    longer can we refer to all these system as GPS-that is not an accurate description
    when referring to new global Navigation Satellite system (GNSS) receiver technology
    today”. Instead, Grey Guyette adds GNSS covers all countries satellite con stellations
    including GPS, GLONASS and Galileo [21,22,23] (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 GPS Full size image
    2. Mobile Devices: After figuring out where PA stands on the planets, the next
    most important innovation these past 20 year would have to be the development
    of mobile devices. “Without the cell phone, we probably would still be sitting
    in barn a lot, waiting for someone to come to the barn and make things work”,
    Says Reifsteck. Today, cell phone has morphed into a whole host of useful mobile
    devices including smatphone and tablets. As of 2016, most precision agriculture
    manufactures that dabble in the mobile devices market have spent most of their
    time trying to expand the capabilities these products can offer to users. According
    to Dr. M. Barnes “if you cannot get your technical data to work for the farmers
    within first 20 min after he receives it, he is probably never going to use it”.
    Robotics: Robots are taking on making many tasks in agriculture these days, including
    planting greenhouse crops and pruning vineyards. In a different approach, the
    Fendt MARS (Mobile Agriculture Robot Swarms) project utilizers small corn seeding
    robots that are lightweight, energy efficient, highly agile, cloud controlled
    and operated from tablet app [24,25,26,27]. Irrigation: Innovations in precision
    agriculture technologies are growing even more crucial as growers face water scarcity
    due t drought, aquifer depletion and water allocations. Adoption with valley irrigation,
    products now allow growers to remotely monitor, and control nearly facet of their
    irrigation operations. The system save water. Timely, fuel and wear and tear on
    the vehicles. In the future, Compbell says producers will be integrating soil
    moisture monitoring, weather data and variable- rate irrigation (VRI) inti their
    system. Internet of Things: One of the newest buzzwords to hit precision over
    the past few of years is the “Internet of things” (IOT). Simply defined, it’s
    the concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the internet. This
    network of connected things could also include people with wearable devices. Most
    recently, a few ag startups and components suppliers (hardware, software etc.)
    are using LPWANs (Low Power wide Area Network) in place of or to augment cellular
    networks in wireless data transmission. These networks are designed to carry small
    amounts of data transmitted intermittently over long ranges” says Paul Welbig
    [28]. Sensors: In precision agriculture, wireless sensors are used to collect
    data on a variety of factors, including soil water availability, soil compaction,
    soil fertility, leaf temperature, leaf area index, plant water status, local climatic
    data, insect-disease-weed infestation, and more. The management of water uses
    some of the most cutting-edge and varied technology now available. The growing
    control of water consumption across the country, as well as the shortage of water,
    will continue to be the driving force for advancements in this field [29]. Variable
    Rate seeding: It might come as a surprise to learn that variable-rate application
    (VRA) seeding is included on this list, considering all of the new and interesting
    technology for precision agriculture that are included. There is not much of a
    difference between it and variable rate fertiliser, because VRA sowing depends
    on your capacity to put together precise data for the seed itself, which is the
    beginning of the agricultural process [30,31,32] (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Weather modelling
    Full size image When you go into the majority of the country''s agricultural retail
    establishments, there is a good possibility that you will find some form of weather
    tracker on display. There is perhaps no other variable that is both as significant
    and as unpredictably vital as the weather. However, assistance is on its way.
    “Over the past 25 years, you’ve gotten a lot of important technologies developed
    that would be even more valuable with quality weather modelling, but we are now
    at a point where assuring good crop yields is key to making certain the world
    has food solutions that works”, says Jeff Kaiser, Vice President, Iteris. As an
    illustration of this, consider the case of a potato planter in the Northern Plains
    who discovered that harvesting his crop at a particular temperature was essential
    to preserving the crop''s quality and consistency. “But by using clear Ag, this
    grower was able to take all their soil reading remotely and he was able to accomplish
    his harvest a lot more efficiently than even before” [33,34,35,36]. Nitrogen Modelling:
    The fertilizer have been used in forms of variable rate for decades, nitrogen
    modelling has become pronounced recently. “Our clientele has been using variable
    rate technologies for fertilizer applications Since the mid 1990s”, says Matt
    waits, CEO for SST software. “However, the complexity of the N-cycle and how it
    is in a constant state of fux has always made managing nitrogen difficult”. A
    recent partnership between SST software and agronomic technology Corp (ATC) resulted
    in the introduction of Adopt-N. Adopt-N was initially presented to the public
    in 2014, and according to Steve Sibulkin, Chief Executive Officer of ATC, it is
    rapidly becoming into an essential instrument for effectively regulating the utilization
    of nitrogen. The overwhelming majority of farmers desire an easy-to-implement
    solution that will allow them to handle these issues (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Controlled
    release micronutrient fertilizer for precision farming Full size image Standardization:
    Initial efforts to implement this began almost eight years ago with the founding
    of the agriculture industry electronic foundation. Equipment manufacturers’ components,
    mainly those that adhere to the ISOBUS standard, continue to make their way into
    official circulation. More than 170 businesses, associations, and other types
    of organisations are currently part of the group and are actively working together
    to ensure that the standards are effective. However, industry players who have
    to deal with equipment compatibility “ On the ground” continue to be unhappy,
    and third party tech specialists frequently have difficulty managing items from
    rival providers. It is a lot better than it was, but it is still a significant
    problem. There will come a day, ideally, when components will get to the point
    where they are pretty much plug-and-play. It’s interesting to know that Precision
    Agriculture sure drive system today have wireless sensors together data on soil
    availability, Compaction, infertility and other data [37,38,39]. 3 Precision Agriculture’s
    Role in the New Era of the Farm Land Sector. The new generation of Agriculture
    systems addresses climate change adaptation alongside investor’s usual goals of
    improving yield and reducing costs. Precision farming refers to the precise application
    of agricultural inputs with respect to soil, weather as well as to crop need in
    order to improve productivity, quality and profitability in agriculture. Hence,
    precision agriculture is about going the right thing, in the right place, in the
    right way at the right [40]. 3.1 Advantages of Precision Farming It did this by
    increasing agricultural productivity and halting soil deterioration on areas suitable
    for cultivation, which led to further agricultural advancement. It will result
    in a reduction in the excessive use of chemicals in agricultural production. Precision
    farming allows for more effective use of available water resources. Agricultural
    fields may be surveyed more easily with the use of GPS. Additionally, the yield
    as well as the features of the soil may be plotted. The dissemination of knowledge
    on agricultural methods, with the goals of improving crop quality and quantity
    while simultaneously lowering production costs. Through the optimization of agrochemical
    products, it lessens the threat to the environment, in particular with regard
    to the leaching of nitrates and the poisoning of groundwater. It enhances the
    possibilities for better resource management, which in turn helps to decrease
    the number of resources that are wasted. An undulated field may be subdivided
    into smaller plots according to the specific needs of the individual customers.
    3.2 Disadvantages of Precision Farming Farmers may be dissuaded from adopting
    this style of farming due to the high initial investment required. Techniques
    for precision farming are still in the process of being developed and require
    the advise of specialists before they can be put into practise. It is possible
    that it will take several years before sufficient data is collected to really
    deploy the system in its entirety. It is a very challenging endeavor, particularly
    the gathering of data and the interpretation of the results. 3.3 How Could India
    Benefit from Precision Farming? A decrease in the cost of production, an increase
    in productivity, and a more efficient use of natural resources may all be achieved
    in India through the development, refinement, and wider deployment of precision
    agricultural technology. It has the potential to completely transform the way
    farms are managed in modern India. As a result of improvements in profitability,
    productivity, sustainability, crop quality, environmental protection, on-farm
    quality of life, food safety, and rural economic growth. Application of site-specific
    irrigation in wheat grown in Punjab and Haryana, use of site-specific herbicides
    in cotton, and application of site-specific fertilizers in oil palm plantation
    in south India, as well as coffee and tea gardens in eastern India. India is able
    to significantly lower manufacturing costs, as well as lower production expenses,
    and lower the amount of chemicals that are loaded into the environment [41]. When
    there are limited amounts of water available, it can improve the efficiency of
    the irrigation system. In addition to this, it offers new instruments for the
    evaluation of multifunctional features, such as those that do not involve the
    market, and it expands job chances for those with specialized training in the
    agriculture industry. The farmer may utilize the prediction to prevent issues
    like as water stress, nutritional inadequacy, and pest and disease infestation.
    The state of greenhouses in agricultural areas may be monitored by it, which is
    an important function it plays. 4 Challenges in Adopting Precision Farming in
    India 1. The implementation of PA in India is still in the preliminary stages
    as a result of the country''s distinctive pattern of land ownership, its inadequate
    infrastructure, the reluctance of farmers to take risks, as well as the country''s
    social, economic, and demographic circumstances. 2. The majority of Indian agriculture
    is conducted on very tiny plots of land, which restricts the economic improvements
    that may be made with the precision farming equipment that is now available. 4.1
    The War Forward New windows of opportunity for the implementation of precision
    farming are opening up in India as a result of the rapid socioeconomic shifts
    that include economic growth, urbanization, and increased energy consumption.
    Instead of blindly adopting the advanced precision agriculture technologies adopted
    by developed countries, India should adopt technologies based on the need of socio-economic
    condition of the country (IAS express-2022). 5 How Precision Agriculture in India
    is Adopted According to Rashika Solomon (2020), the agriculture is backbone of
    India’s economy, which accounts for 18% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP)
    and hires about half of the countries workforce. More than 70% of rural families
    depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The implementation of forward-thinking
    agricultural practises such as precision agriculture is a viable option for accomplishing
    this objective. The PA is an integrated crop management system that monitors the
    agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing (RS), global positioning
    system (GPS), and geographical information system (GIS). Recording and mapping
    the variations in crop and soil parameters that are present within a field is
    done. Following this, management decisions are made based on the findings of ongoing
    assessments of the spatial variability within the given field. In India, it is
    referred to as the efficient use of agricultural inputs in order to achieve higher
    levels of crop output (Gunnamreddy, 2022). 6 Conclusion Technologies that enable
    precision agriculture are playing an increasingly important part in the production
    of food crops. PA, For example, a guiding system for tractors that uses GPS. The
    use of global positioning system (GPS) technology for mapping soil and yield as
    well as variable-rate input applications helps farmers collect information on
    the changing field condition so that production techniques may be adjusted. Soil
    mapping, a similar precision technique, provides farmers with additional data
    that they can really use. When creating soil maps, more soil samples are collected,
    and zones are used to depict the different soil types, nitrate levels, and pH
    acidity readings. GPS is used by farmers to plot yield maps and data on maps in
    synchronisation with one another. Nevertheless, soil maps have a lot of practical
    applications since they display properties of the ground that are likely to be
    consistent from year to year. Finally, variable rate input application technology
    (VRT) enables farmers to tailor the application of fertiliser, chemicals, and
    pesticides by making use of GPS data, which is often derived from yield and soil
    maps. The adoption of PA in India depends on the pressure of population which
    is growing rapidly and more than 65% are directly employed by agricultural system.
    Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to modernize conventional agricultural
    techniques and be ready for an impending technological revolution in order to
    build an environmentally friendly system for increasing crop yield. The implementation
    of forward-thinking agricultural practices such as precision agriculture is a
    viable option for accomplishing this objective. PA is an integrated crop management
    system that monitors the agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing
    (RS), global positioning systems (GPS), and geographic information systems (GIS).
    Recording and mapping the differences in crop or soil qualities that are present
    within a field is done. In India, it is known as the exact exploitation of agricultural
    inputs to discover improved crop output by utilizing precision agriculture. This
    is done in an effort to improve food security. References Anonymous: What is precision

    the current era, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has gained popularity.
    This is due to addition of sensing, receiving, and transmitting capabilities to
    any physical object. IoT plays a vital role in various verticals of everyday life.
    IoT finds its application in Industrial IoT, precision agriculture, smart cities,
    and healthcare applications [1]. The sensors in the IoT system sense various physical
    parameters. The data is collected from these sensors and stored in a central server.
    However, the data security in the central server and its privacy preservation
    is an important aspect. The IoT brings in several advantages, but the leakage
    of the sensitive information or the attack by hackers can ruin its sole purpose.
    Therefore, connecting several physical objects over the Internet with strong protection
    of the data is the prime requirement. The focus of research is to save this collected
    data securely in decentralized architecture. The integration of blockchain technology
    in IoT permits the physical objects to securely transmit data in peer-to-peer
    network. The blockchain minimizes the risk of any fraudulent information entering
    in the IoT network. This is because before the entry of data in within the network,
    the consent is taken from majority of the users instead of the single central
    authority [2]. Furthermore, blockchain-based IoT system builds a strong and robust
    network in which it prevents the hackers to steal all the information just by
    attacking the central server. In IoT-based system, data security is obtained by
    applying encryption. The encryption technique involves each node in the IoT system
    to carry two keys, namely public key and private key. The public key is available
    to other nodes that encrypts the data which is then broadcasted to all other nodes
    in the network. The private key is secret to individual nodes that is used for
    decrypting the data. The blockchain technology prevents the fraudulent intruder
    to falsely encrypt the information. In a blockchain-based IoT network, all the
    physical objects within the network are identified by public key. Therefore, this
    sharing may lead to third-party attack that can make out the identity of the IoT
    participants. The blockchain-based IoT system eliminates single point of failure;
    this enhances fault tolerance and reliability of IoT system. The IoT devices participating
    in a blockchain-based network can verify data integrity and identity of sender
    [3]. Also, blockchain provides secure software updates and data storage capability
    to IoT-based system. Furthermore, blockchain technology stores data in an immutable
    which provides backtracking and traceability capabilities. IoT allows the inter-connectivity
    of physical objects “things” by providing sensing and transmitting capabilities.
    In the current era, IoT finds its applications in everyday life making smart networks.
    These smart networks are capable of sensing various physical parameters and the
    taking valuable decisions. The decentralization enhances the IoT networks scalability
    and performances. With the exponential growth in the adoption and popularity of
    IoT technology, the demand of secure data storage and transmission is increasing
    immensely. The security of the data is essential; any kind of data leakage or
    attack by intruder can lead to disclosure of critical information. Thus, it is
    essential to preserve the privacy of data and grant access of data to authorized
    users. However, there are few prerequisite security requirements for IoT-based
    system like confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, authorization,
    and availability. The integration of the block chain technology with IoT enhances
    the reliability of IoT-based system in terms of security. The blockchain provides
    data security to resource constrained end devices in IoT-based system. Also, the
    blockchain technology is capable to handle heterogeneity, privacy protection,
    and confidentiality of IoT-based systems. 2 Literature Review This section describes
    literature review of the state-of-the-art approaches. Bhutta et al. [4] in 1991
    introduced blockchain technology as “a cryptographically secured chain of blocks”.
    Baur et al. [5] in 2018 implemented blockchain as a public ledger and received
    universal recognition in a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin. It is gaining popularity
    in various sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and insurance. The blockchain
    technology provides secure distributed architecture that works without intervention
    of any centralized or third party. Wang et al. [6] defined blockchain as a chain
    of blocks that are linked cryptographically using hash functions. It works on
    a peer-to-peer network of participants. The blockchain technology provides the
    highest degree of accountability. This feature has resulted in the adaptation
    of blockchain technology for data transmission and record-keeping in various sectors
    of real-life applications. The blockchain technology provides these real-life
    applications with proper documentation and digitally confirms the ownership of
    assets. Hildebrand et al. [7] proposed that blockchain technology blocks are ordered
    unambiguously using consensus algorithm. Thus, this makes blockchain technology
    verifiable, consistent, auditable and enhances integrity among all the participants.
    Jain et al. [8] proposed a block constitutes version information, hash of the
    parent block, timestamp, nonce, count of transaction, and combination of hash
    transactions. Whenever a new block has been generated, then each participant will
    apply block authentication process. After appropriate validation and approval,
    this block is appended to the parent block with the help of reference. This process
    helps to detect the unidentified or unauthorized transactions. Unauthorized or
    falsified blocks can be identified by the hash value which is completely different
    from authorized blocks. Meryem et al. [9] proposed the integration of blockchain
    technology for security in IoT-based smart homes. Mohamed et al. [10] proposed
    security in IoT-enabled smart industry environment for Industry 4.0 applications.
    3 Working Principle of Blockchain A blockchain structure is represented in the
    form of list of blocks with ordered transactions. The list is stored as flat file
    database. The point to notice is that there is no pointer pointing to the first
    block, and the terminal block has a pointer with null value. Figure 1 shows the
    structure of blockchain. A block contains version, parent block hash, timestamp,
    nonce, transaction count, and Merkle root. Nonce is an integer that starts from
    0 and increases every time after hash is calculated. The Merkle root is the combined
    hash of all transactions. Figure 2 shows the working principle of a blockchain
    technology. Whenever a new record or transaction is to be added into a blockchain,
    it needs to be verified and digitally signed by nodes in the system. Any block
    contains data, its hash value, and hash of the previous block. It depends which
    kind of data has been stored in a blockchain such as receiver, sender, and the
    amount of coins. A hash is like a digital signature or a fingerprint. The hash
    of a block is generated using cryptographic hash algorithm. The hash helps in
    identifying each block in a blockchain structure. Any modification in a block
    results in change of its hash. The hash of the previous block helps to form a
    chain structure which plays a major role of providing security. Any fraudulent
    attempt to change the data of a block leads to invalidation of the whole blockchain
    system. The proof-of-work is performed by the miners which are special nodes within
    the blockchain structure. The miners get transaction fees as a reward from the
    block. Whenever a new block is created, it is verified by all nodes in a system.
    All nodes in the blockchain system adhere to the consensus protocol. Thus, this
    makes a blockchain system immutable and secure [11]. Table 1 shows the classification
    of blockchain architecture. Fig. 1 Blockchain structure Full size image Fig. 2
    Working principle of blockchain technology Full size image Table 1 Classification
    of blockchain architecture Full size table The major characteristics that have
    resulted in adaption of blockchain technology in real-life applications are as
    follows: Transparency: The participants in the public blockchain systems can communicate
    with equal rights. In the public blockchain systems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin,
    the authentication of each transaction is recorded. This data is available to
    all the participants in the blockchain network. Thus, data on the blockchain is
    transparent to each node so as to validate the committed transaction in the blockchain.
    Decentralization: In a centralized architecture, the validation of transaction
    is performed by central server. This causes bottleneck problem, whereas blockchain
    works on a distributed architecture where validation of transaction is performed
    in peer-to-peer manner. Thus, this enhances the performance of system in terms
    of cost-effectiveness, resolving bottleneck problem, and single-point failure.
    Immutability: In a blockchain, a chain structure is formed by linking the blocks
    through hash values. When any kind of data tampering is performed, it causes invalidation
    of all consecutive blocks. Thus, the blockchain structure is immutable. Pseudonymity:
    The blockchain is partially confidential as the addresses of participants can
    be traced. Non-repudiation: Each participant in the blockchain system contains
    a private key. This can be decrypted by other participants with help of public
    keys. Thus, cryptographically encrypted transactions are non-repudiable. Traceability:
    The blockchain technology offers traceability; this is achieved with help of timestamp
    attached to every transaction. This results in tractability of origin and modification
    of any transaction [12]. 4 Smart Contracts The smart contract can be defined as
    the programs which are stored on a blockchain. The smart contract programs run
    only when the predetermined conditions are fulfilled. The benefit of smart contract
    is that they automate the execution of an agreement. This results in reliability
    of the agreement without involving any third party. Furthermore, it is a faster
    approach which makes the system autonomous where workflows are maintained and
    the consecutive actions are triggered on fulfillment of the predetermined conditions.
    Thus, smart contracts insert a secure and automatic contractual mechanism where
    the contracting parties evaluate success or violation of the contract. Smart contracts
    are programs that encrypt and replicate contractual agreements [13]. The smart
    contract through blockchain technology in computer domain brings various benefits
    such as no commission fees, no involvement of trusted-party dependency, and no
    mutual interaction of counterparties. Smart contracts can be generated by publishing
    a transaction to the blockchain. The miners in the blockchain run smart contracts
    and achieve agreement on its implementation. Each contract is assigned a 160-bit
    address on implementation. If a transaction is generated, then contract is executed
    using this address. There are various platforms for the development of smart contract
    such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Nem, Corda, Stellar, Waves, Cardano,
    Neo, EOS, Rootstock, Tendermint, and Quorum. These platforms such as Bitcoin can
    implement smart contracts that offer a modern-way of money exchange that provides
    innovative solutions and easy interfaces for developers. 5 Blockchain Integration
    with IoT IoT provides digital transformation and has revolutionized the real world.
    The network of sensors produces large voluminous data which is analyzed by a central
    server. The central server makes valuable decision and helps in knowledge discovery.
    The information in the IoT-based system requires safe and secure transmission
    and storage. The integration of the block chain technology with IoT enhances the
    reliability of IoT-based system in terms of security [14]. The blockchain provides
    data security to resource-constrained end devices in IoT-based system. Also, the
    blockchain technology is capable to handle heterogeneity, privacy protection,
    and confidentiality of IoT-based systems. The major advantages of integrating
    blockchain technology in IoT-based systems are listed below: The data which is
    collected by the sensors is secured by blockchains. The storage of this data is
    done in blockchain network in the form of encrypted transactions. The blockchain
    technology provides the IoT-based systems with enhanced interoperability. There
    is no involvement of third party while interaction between the IoT devices which
    makes the whole IoT system autonomous [15, 16]. Blockchain technology enhances
    the reliability of IoT-based system by providing availability, authenticity, confidentiality,
    accountability, and traceability. Also, blockchain faster the process of IoT-based
    systems by proving secure and decentralized features with no third-party intervention.
    The blockchain technology utilizes consensus mechanisms which prevents denial-of-service
    attacks. This is achieved by imposing charge for each transaction. The technology
    implementation in IoT networks enhances the overall security within the network
    by enforcing access control and data integrity [17, 18]. The blockchain technology
    makes it impossible for the intruders to modify records and hide transactions
    in IoT-based systems. This is achieved through decentralized consensus mechanism.
    It utilizes features of encrypting data using public and private keys which provides
    privacy preservation [19, 20]. 6 Proposed Secure IoT-Based Land Registry Architecture
    The land registry involves sharing transactional information of land pieces. The
    blockchain enhances data security and provides secure land registry system including
    authentication of all land transactions between involved parties. The blockchain
    technology prevents illegal land transaction, and through hash-based chain structure,
    it detects fraudulent modification registry. Thus, it helps to secure land transactions
    and registry records. Figure 3 shows the proposed land registry system architecture.
    Initially, all land registry centers and users are required to register themselves
    in a mobile application. They will receive pairs of public and private keys by
    execution of the registration function. A user can request the land registry centers
    to issue certificate. When the user initiates a request to the authorities, then
    verification of users details is performed which is stored on the blockchain network.
    The blockchain network issues a certificate based on users details stored during
    the registration. The issued certificate is stored in a decentralized Inter-Planetary
    File System. The user then receives the calculated hash value. The land registry
    details are managed as a transaction with a unique ID. This transaction is stored
    in a specific block of the blockchain network. Fig. 3 Proposed secure IoT-based
    land registry architecture Full size image 7 Conclusion The paper presents a comprehensive
    survey of blockchain technology including characteristics, architecture, and working
    principle of blockchain. It describes the need of data security and privacy preservation
    for IoT-based systems. Also, it describes the benefits of integrating blockchain
    technology with the IoT-based systems and solution that blockchain technology
    provides to IoT-based system in terms of security. This paper proposes a blockchain-based
    technology to provide security in terms of authenticity, integrity, availability,
    and confidentiality. The paper presents a secure IoT-based land registry system

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Shah Alam, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture represents a crucial sector that underpins our population growth and
    well-being. It has been providing nourishment for generations. The agricultural
    sector faces numerous challenges, including climate change, insufficient agricultural
    land, growing population, biodiversity loss, and low investment in agriculture
    [1], Farmers must cope with climate change, soil erosion, and biodiversity loss,
    satisfy consumers’ changing tastes and expectations, and meet rising demand for
    more food of higher quality [2], The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
    Development (OECD) emphasizes the three key challenges facing agriculture: feeding
    a growing population, providing a livelihood for farmers, and protecting the environment
    [3], Global threats to agriculture include climate change, depleted resources,
    and soil erosion, which negatively impact the industry and overall food security
    [4], The loss of agricultural land through erosion and manmade factors is one
    of the large problems facing agriculture [5], The World Bank addresses key issues
    in agriculture, including the lack of access to adequate food for a significant
    portion of the world’s population, the need to fight climate change, and the importance
    of digital transformation in the agrifood system [6], Table 1 summarizes the challenges
    facing agriculture: Table 1 Agriculture Challenges These challenges require innovative
    solutions to ensure sustainable productivity growth to feed a growing world population
    in a changing climate, while simultaneously reducing the sector’s greenhouse gas
    emissions. The agriculture sector needs to embrace innovative technologies such
    as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) to navigate these challenges and embrace
    the opportunities of the future [7][8][9][10]. AIoT is a combination of artificial
    intelligence (Al) technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure.
    AIoT can be used in agriculture to optimize resource utilization, improve production
    management and productivity, and reduce labor dependency [11], SECTION II. Literature
    Review A. What is AIoT? AIoT is a rapidly growing technology that combines the
    power of Al with the connectivity of IoT to create a powerful tool for agricultural
    transformation. Al can analyze large amounts of data from IoT sensors to identify
    patterns and trends that can help farmers make better decisions. For instance,
    Al can be used to monitor crop health, identify pests and diseases, and optimize
    irrigation schedules. Recent advancements in AIoT applications for precision agriculture
    have been discussed in several research papers [7] [8] [12], These papers highlight
    the current progress, applications, and advantages of AIoT in agriculture, including
    optimizing resource utilization, improving production management and productivity,
    and reducing labor dependency. The adoption of AIoT technology significantly transforms
    the traditional agriculture scenario by addressing numerous challenges, including
    pest management and post-harvest management issues [8] [11], However, there are
    still some barriers that need to be overcome, such as the cost factors and the
    adaptation to traditional agricultural practices [8], An AIoT-based smart agricultural
    system for pests’ detection has been proposed in a research paper [13], This system
    notifies farmers of the presence of different pests before they start multiplying
    in large numbers. B. Benefits of AIoT in agriculture AIoT in agriculture offers
    various benefits, including increased efficiency and productivity, reduced labor
    dependency, improved decision-making, and increased sustainability as shown in
    Figure 1. Increase efficiency and productivity. AIoT offers significant benefits
    to farmers by automating tasks such as crop monitoring and irrigation. This automation
    frees up farmers’ time, allowing them to focus on other important activities.
    By utilizing AIoT technologies, farmers can access real-time data on crop health,
    soil moisture, and other relevant factors. This information assists them in making
    more informed decisions about planting, irrigation, and harvesting [7] [8][11],
    For example, Precision Hawk employs AIoT in conjunction with drones to monitor
    crops. Drones collect data on crop health and soil moisture, which is then analyzed
    by AIoT algorithms. The analyzed data is transformed into detailed maps of crop
    fields, enabling farmers to identify areas that require additional attention [14],
    According to a recent study conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute, the implementation
    of Al in agriculture could potentially increase productivity by 70{%} by the year
    2050. This increase in productivity would be instrumental in meeting the food
    demands of a growing global population. Reduce labor dependency:AI-powered robots
    are already being used for tasks like weeding and harvesting. As these robots
    become more sophisticated, they could potentially replace human labor on many
    farms. This could result in job losses in the agricultural sector, but also help
    reduce the cost of food production and save farmers time and money. For example,
    FarmBot sells robotic farming systems that can automate tasks like planting, watering,
    and weeding crops. The systems are controlled via a smartphone or tablet and can
    be programmed to follow specific instructions [8][11][15][16][17], Improve decision-making:AIoT
    can help farmers make better decisions about crop planting, irrigation, and pest
    control by analyzing real-time data from sensors and other IoT devices. This information
    can be used to identify potential problems early on, such as pests or diseases,
    and to take corrective action before they cause significant damage. For example,
    CropMetrics uses AIoT to monitor crops for pests and diseases. The company’s sensors
    collect data on crop health, soil moisture, and other factors, which is then analyzed
    by AIoT algorithms. This information is used to create alerts when there is a
    potential problem, such as the presence of a pest or disease [8][11][13][18],
    Enhance sustainability. AIoT in agriculture can help farmers reduce their environmental
    impact by optimizing resource use and minimizing waste. For instance, AIoT can
    be used to monitor water usage and adjust irrigation schedules accordingly, which
    can help to reduce water waste and improve crop yields. WaterBit is a company
    that sells IoT-enabled water monitoring systems that can be used to track water
    usage in agricultural settings [19], Fig. 1. Benefits of AIoT in Agriculture Show
    All C. Opportunities of AIoT in agriculture AIoT presents various opportunities
    to enhance productivity, sustainability, and decision-making in agriculture (Figure
    2). Precision Farming:AIoT enables precise monitoring and management of crops,
    resulting in optimized resource utilization and improved crop yields. For example,
    AIoT systems can analyze real-time data on soil moisture, weather conditions,
    and crop health to provide precise recommendations for irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [11]. Predictive analytics:Leveraging Al algorithms, AIoT can
    analyze historical and real-time data to generate predictive insights. This helps
    farmers to predict crop diseases, pest outbreaks or weather conditions. For example,
    AIoT can predict the occurrence of diseases based on environmental conditions,
    enabling farmers to take timely preventive measures [8]. Autonomous Farming:AIoT
    can enable autonomous farming operations through the use of autonomous vehicles,
    robots, and drones. Tasks such as planting, spraying and harvesting can be carried
    out precisely and efficiently with these devices. For example, Al-powered drones
    can monitor crop health and identify areas that need attention or apply targeted
    treatments [20]. Resource optimization:AIoT systems can optimize the use of resources
    such as water, fertilizers and energy. By analyzing data from sensors and environmental
    factors, AIoT can provide insights into resource allocation, reduce waste and
    improve sustainability. For example, AIoT can optimize irrigation schedules based
    on soil moisture levels and weather forecasts, saving water while maintaining
    crop health [11] [21]. Supply chain efficiency:AIoT can improve agricultural supply
    chain efficiency by providing real-time data and insights. This includes monitoring
    and tracking products, optimizing transport routes and managing inventory. For
    example, AIoT can provide real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity during
    storage and transportation, ensuring the quality and freshness of agricultural
    products [20]. Decision support systems:AIoT can provide farmers with decision
    support systems that provide actionable insights and recommendations. By analyzing
    data from multiple sources, including weather forecasts, market trends, and harvest
    data, AIoT systems can help farmers make informed decisions about planting, harvesting,
    and marketing strategies [8]. These possibilities highlight the potential of AIoT
    to revolutionize agriculture by improving productivity, sustainability and decision-making.
    By harnessing the power of Al and IoT technologies, farmers can optimize resource
    use, reduce costs and increase overall efficiency on farms. Fig. 2. Opportunities
    of AIoT in agriculture Show All D. Challenges of AIoT in agriculture While AIoT
    promises substantial benefits and opportunities for agriculture, its implementation
    presents certain challenges (Figure 3). Data Quality and Integration:AIoT in agriculture
    relies on collecting and analyzing large amounts of data from various sources
    such as sensors, drones, and satellite imagery. Ensuring the quality, accuracy,
    and compatibility of diverse data sets can be challenging. For example, integrating
    data from different types of sensors or ensuring the consistency of data collected
    over time can pose difficulties [22]. Connectivity and Infrastructure:AIoT systems
    require robust and reliable connectivity to transmit data in realtime. However,
    many agricultural areas lack adequate network coverage and internet connectivity.
    This can hinder the seamless functioning of AIoT systems and limit their effectiveness.
    Limited infrastructure can also be a challenge, particularly in rural or remote
    regions [23][24]. Cost and Affordability:Implementing AIoT solutions can involve
    significant costs. Acquiring and deploying the necessary hardware, sensors, and
    IoT devices, as well as setting up the required infrastructure, can be expensive.
    For small-scale or resource-constrained farmers, the upfront costs and ongoing
    maintenance expenses may pose financial challenges [25]. Data Privacy and Security:AIoT
    systems collect and process sensitive data related to crop health, soil conditions,
    and other farm-related information. Ensuring data privacy and protecting against
    cyber threats are critical challenges. Unauthorized access, data breaches, or
    misuse of personal and agricultural data could have serious consequences for farmers
    and the entire agriculture industry [26][27]. Adoption and User Training:Introducing
    AIoT technologies requires farmers and agricultural workers to adapt to new tools
    and processes. Some farmers may face challenges in understanding and utilizing
    AIoT solutions effectively. Training and education programs are essential to ensure
    farmers have the necessary skills and knowledge to leverage AIoT technologies
    optimally [28][29][30]. Interoperability and Standards:AIoT systems often involve
    multiple devices, platforms, and software from different manufacturers and providers.
    Ensuring interoperability and standardization among these systems can be complex.
    Lack of compatibility and standard protocols may limit the seamless integration
    and exchange of data between different components of AIoT solutions [31][32].
    Addressing these challenges is crucial to fully harness the potential of AIoT
    in agriculture and maximize its benefits for farmers and the industry as a whole.
    Fig. 3. Key challenges of AIoT in agriculture Show All SECTION III. Future Research

    in AIoT:Edge computing, which involves processing data closer to the source (e.g.,
    on IoT devices), can enhance the responsiveness and reduce latency in AIoT systems.
    Future research should explore how edge computing can be effectively integrated
    into AIoT in agriculture to enable real-time decision-making without relying heavily
    on cloud-based processing. Interoperability and Standards:Addressing the interoperability
    challenges in AIoT systems is critical to facilitate seamless data exchange and
    integration between different devices and platforms. Research efforts should focus
    on developing common standards and protocols to enable the interoperability of
    AIoT solutions from different manufacturers. Sustainable Resource Management:AIoT
    can play a significant role in optimizing resource utilization in agriculture.
    Future research should investigate AI-driven approaches to conserve water, improve
    soil health, and minimize energy consumption while maximizing crop productivity.

    autonomous farming practices. AIoT and Climate Resilience:Investigating how AIoT
    can assist farmers in adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change
    is essential. Future research should focus on developing AIoT solutions that provide
    real-time weather predictions, early warning systems for extreme weather events,
    and climate-smart farming practices. AIoT Data Analytics:Research should concentrate
    on developing data analytics techniques that can extract meaningful insights from
    the vast amount of data generated by AIoT systems in agriculture. This includes
    integrating data from various sources, data fusion, anomaly detection, and predictive
    modeling to support informed decisionmaking. AIoT Adoption and Usability:Exploring
    factors that influence the adoption of AIoT technologies among farmers and agricultural
    stakeholders is vital. Research should identify barriers to adoption and devise
    strategies to enhance the usability and user-friendliness of AIoT solutions. Social
    and Ethical Implications: Future research should examine the social and ethical
    implications of AIoT adoption in agriculture. Understanding the potential impacts
    on farmers’ livelihoods, labor displacement, data ownership, and environmental
    sustainability is critical for responsible and equitable AIoT implementation.
    AIoT-Based Market and Supply Chain Integration:Investigating the role of AIoT
    in streamlining agricultural supply chains, reducing food waste, and ensuring
    fair market access for small-scale farmers is essential. Research should explore
    how AIoT can enhance traceability and transparency in the supply chain, contributing
    to food safety and quality assurance. Multi-Scale AIoT Integration:Research should
    focus on the integration of AIoT technologies across different scales of agriculture,
    from small family farms to large-scale agribusinesses. Exploring AIoT solutions
    that can be tailored to diverse agricultural contexts will enable wider adoption
    and impact. By pursuing these research directions, the agricultural industry can
    fully capitalize on the potential of AIoT, revolutionizing farming practices,
    improving productivity, and contributing to a sustainable and food-secure future.
    SECTION IV. Conclusion Agriculture faces numerous challenges in the modem world,
    from climate change to limited resources and the need for sustainable practices.
    AIoT emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges and unlock new
    opportunities for farmers and the agricultural industry. The combination of Al
    and IoT technologies in agriculture presents benefits such as increased efficiency,
    reduced labor dependency, improved decision-making, and enhanced sustainability.
    Opportunities in AIoT include precision farming, predictive analytics, autonomous
    farming, resource optimization, supply chain efficiency, and decision support
    systems. However, implementing AIoT in agriculture is not without its challenges,
    including data quality, connectivity, costs, privacy, and user adoption. By overcoming
    these challenges and embracing innovative AIoT technologies, the agriculture sector
    can pave the way for sustainable productivity growth, ensuring food security for
    a growing global population. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to extend our heartfelt

  description: Continued development of communication technologies has led to widespread
    Internet-of-Things (IoT) integration into various domains, including health, manufacturing,
    automotive, and precision agriculture. This has further led to the increased sharing
    of data among such domains to foster innovation. Most of these IoT deployments,
    however, are based on heterogeneous, pervasive sensors, which can lead to quality
    issues in the recorded data. This can lead to sharing of inaccurate or inconsistent
    data. There is a significant need to assess the quality of the collected data,
    should it be shared with multiple application domains, as inconsistencies in the
    data could have financial or health ramifications. This article builds on the
    recent research on trust metrics and presents a framework to integrate such metrics
    into the IoT data cycle for real-time data quality assessment. Critically, this
    article adopts a mechanism to facilitate end-user parameterization of a trust
    metric tailoring its use in the framework. Trust is a well-established metric
    that has been used to determine the validity of a piece or source of data in crowd-sourced
    or other unreliable data collection techniques such as that in IoT. The article
    further discusses how the trust-based framework eliminates the requirement for
    a gold standard and provides visibility into data quality assessment throughout
    the big data model. To qualify the use of trust as a measure of quality, an experiment
    is conducted using data collected from an IoT deployment of sensors to measure
    air quality in which low-cost sensors were colocated with a gold standard reference
    sensor. The calculated trust metric is compared with two well-understood metrics
    for data quality, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
    A strong correlation between the trust metric and the comparison metrics shows
    that trust may be used as an indicative quality metric for data quality. The metric
    incorporates the additional benefit of its ability for use in low context scenarios,
    as opposed to RMSE and MAE, which require a reference for comparison.

    I. Introduction The Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has seen tremendous growth
    in the industry in the last five years. The number of connected devices in various
    sectors has also grown. This has, in turn, led to an increase in the amount of
    data generated and consumed. This exponential increase in data collected and consumed
    led to the IoT big data wave. This is characterized by volume, velocity, variety,
    veracity, and value, the 5V’s of big data as they are known [1]. As this data
    is collected, it must undergo several stages from collection to decision-making.
    These stages form the big data model. The big data model is a series of stages
    that the data must undergo from when it is created to when it is used. Each preceding
    stage is critical for the success of the next stage. Fig. 1 shows the various
    stages of the big data model. Data collection, data preprocessing, data processing,
    and data use are separate stages of the big data model. It is beneficial to interrogate
    data quality independently at each stage in the model. It can also be argued,
    however, that data quality should be reviewed longitudinally through the model
    for a given input and use case. For each stage, data can have different properties,
    and therefore, data quality has to be assessed separately but also represented
    differently. This is equally true for different data users and applications within
    the IoT ecosystem. Fig. 1. Big data model. Show All The data generated and consumed
    within IoT comes from several domains including, but not limited, to: 1) smart
    homes; 2) smart cities; 3) manufacturing; and 4) automotive to environmental sensing.
    Current discussions introduce the opportunities that sharing and consuming data
    across such domains of the IoT ecosystem would have for further innovation in
    the IoT space. This sharing of data across multiple domain spaces is referred
    to as data-shared IoT [2]. The example in Fig. 2 shows how a smart city application
    can benefit from data fusion of its own data with data from other IoT applications
    for better insights. For this fusion to be fruitful, it is important to ensure
    that the shared data conform to certain quality standards and can be trusted by
    the consuming application. Fig. 2. Shared IoT ecosystem. Show All This article
    presents a mechanism that aims to achieve the following objectives: 1) tailor
    assessment as per user requirements; 2) decouple metrics from the evaluation strategy;
    and 3) allow for longitudinal fusion of quality scores. Achieving these aims comes
    with challenges associated with them. Here, the aims are explained, and in Section
    IV, the challenges are highlighted. Decoupling the mechanics of providing a quality
    score from the means of evaluating the quality. The big data cycle (BDC) has various
    stages that data must undergo. At each stage, the data can have different quality
    issues. To determine and address data quality issues, it is beneficial to assess
    quality at each stage considering only the data properties at that stage. The
    ability to map data quality to the individual stage of the BDC will be referred
    to as the mechanics of providing or advertising quality. This can be separated
    from the metric used to evaluate the quality. This article uses a trust metric
    to provide a quality score, however, the mechanism can be applied to other quality
    metrics. This is illustrated in Section VII where each trust stage is decoupled
    and integrated into the BDC. This separation is useful to achieve a domain and
    use-case-agnostic solution. Each unique domain and use case can define its own
    metric for calculating a quality score without affecting the mechanics of applying
    quality assessment or advertising quality. Furthermore, when the quality requirements
    of an application change, the metric of assessing quality can be customized to
    that application’s needs without affecting, or needing to change the underlying
    mechanics of assessment. Longitudinal fusion of data quality defines a means to
    combine the various quality scores from each stage of the BDC into a single score
    that is representative of the end-to- end processes that the data has undergone.
    This process should be independent of the metric of assessing quality. Any fusion
    technique can be used here. In Section VIII, a naive fusion approach was used
    to distinguish between a low-quality stream and a gold reference stream. The intention,
    however, is to investigate more advanced fusion techniques. A tangible link between
    data quality, data quality types, and their effect on data through the stages
    of the BDC has been demonstrated [2]. This concept, however, is yet to be implemented.
    This describes the longitudinal relationship between the various data quality
    issues across the BDC. For example, knowing which data quality issues are present
    in the initial stages of the BDC (data preprocessing) and how this affects the
    next stage can help determine a data-processing technique in that stage. Data
    quality tailoring allows an application to customize quality assessment to suit
    its requirements. Quality itself is subjective and so should be evaluated as such.
    Data that is good for a particular application or use case might not be for the
    other. Each application should be able to define its own quality. For example,
    if data accuracy is important for a particular application and data latency (timeliness)
    is not, then the quality score should be customized to reflect that. This is illustrated
    by the use case in Section X, based on a custom data quality score, and each application
    can connect or disconnect from a data source. Current solutions aim to optimize
    quality assessment for a given use case [3], [4], [5], [6]. The resulting solutions,
    however, may not be applicable to another use case. Taleb et al. [7] described
    the importance of integrating quality assessment with the BDC, connecting quality
    assessment with the source of the quality issues. This approach, however, has
    not been implemented. This article presents a real-time end-to- end implementation
    of a data quality assessment framework that can be used to assess the quality
    of data in IoT deployments. The framework leverages trust as a means to assess
    quality where no reference or ground-truth data is available. Assessment of quality
    throughout the BDC allows identification of introduced quality issues at each
    stage. The framework is agnostic of the trust metric or fusion technique used;
    however, a trust metric presented in earlier work [2] is used in the implementation
    and testing. The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section II presents
    background information. Section III presents the state-of-the-art. Section IV
    details the existing challenges in implementing quality assessment in IoT environments.
    Section V presents the motivation for the proposed framework and highlights why
    trust is an important metric for the assessment of data quality in IoT. Section
    VI provides a detailed description of the framework including the mathematical
    formulation of the framework and microservice-based implementation of the solution.
    Section IX presents the testing environment, datasets employed, evaluation strategy,
    and results of the evaluation. Finally, Section XI presents the concluding remarks
    and future work. SECTION II. Background This section introduces three concepts
    that are central to this work: 1) data quality; 2) data quality dimensions (DQDs)
    and trust; and 3) their application within an IoT context. It then highlights
    the use of trust as a measure of quality. A. Data Quality Data collected from
    sensing IoT devices is of paramount importance today. Such data is being used
    to advance innovations and inform decision-making. Much of this data comes from
    low-cost sensor devices, which are inherently unreliable [8]. Assessing and ascertaining
    the quality of such data before using it is therefore important. Data quality
    has widely been studied in database management [9], [10], [11] and also in the
    big data context [12]. Poor data quality management can have adverse negative
    effects on business decisions [13]. Data quality is subjective, making it dependent
    on the use case and domain area. It has been defined differently in academic and
    industrial contexts [14]. Sidi et al. [3] defined data quality based on how appropriate
    it is for use based on user need. According to Heravizadeh et al. [15], quality
    means the totality of the characteristics of an entity (data) that bear on its
    ability to satisfy stated and implied needs. B. Data Quality Dimensions DQDs provide
    an acceptable way to measure data quality. Several authors have defined different
    DQD, each with associated metrics [14]. A DQD is a characteristic or feature of
    information for classifying information and data requirements. As such, it offers
    a way for measuring and managing data quality as well as information [3]. It is
    important to note that there is no standard definition of DQD that is acceptable
    as domain-independent [16]. It is argued that some of these could be task-independent,
    and therefore not restrained by the context of application while others are task-dependent
    [17]. In Lee et al. [18], many of these were studied and later summarized them
    into four main categories as shown in Table I. TABLE I DQD Categories C. Trust
    Trust can be defined as the belief of a trustor in a trustee that the trustee
    will accomplish a given task by satisfying the trustor’s expectation [16]. Different
    users have different requirements that must be satisfied before they can trust
    a source. Examples of these can relate to DQDs including reliability, competence,
    credentials, and reputation. In the era where information is widely available,
    users are tasked with gauging the quality of such. From the trust perspective,
    a data source can build a reputation over time to become trustworthy. Trust in
    itself is a process, and therefore trust can be formed, improved, and also lost.
    Some data sources have built trust over time and now they are more trusted than
    others. Trust has been widely used in other areas. In service computing, Malik
    and Bouguettaya [19] and Chang et al. [20] used trust to select the best service
    for a user. Jøsang et al. [21] proposed systems that could be used to derive measures
    of trust and reputation for Internet transactions. D. Trust as a Measure of Data
    Quality In a wider sense, trust has been used as a measure of quality, especially
    in information systems. It is assumed that if more people trust a product or service,
    it has better quality and vice versa. This same principle has been used widely
    in information search on the Internet and more recently in recommender engines
    [22]. Like trust, quality is an iterative process that must be constantly reassessed.
    To achieve a level of trustworthiness, different trust attributes must be evaluated
    at every stage and how these contribute to each other. The uniqueness of trust
    as a metric for data quality assessment lies in its properties. Byabazaire et
    al. [23] highlights these properties and how each can be used to harness trust
    as data quality metrics, especially in data-shared IoT scenarios. For example,
    trust is personalizable. In IoT, each application has a unique description of
    data quality. SECTION III. State-of-the-Art Several solutions have been proposed
    to help ensure that data retain its quality within database management and a few
    in the context of IoT and big data. While data quality assessment in a general
    context can be considered a mature field of study, data quality assessment in
    the context of IoT has not yet been fully explored [24]. There are several methods
    to ensure data retains its quality. This Section contrasts two approaches to data
    quality assessment that relate to this work. The first approach aims to develop
    DQDs that can be used by domain experts to assess data quality both generally,
    and in the context of IoT. The other approach aims to take these DQDs and develop
    solutions that automate the process of assessing and improving data quality. A.
    Development of DQDs DQDs offer a way for measuring and managing data quality as
    well as information [25]. More precisely, DQDs describe the various measurable
    metrics of data quality. The main aim of the solutions is to define new DQDs and
    evaluate them based on expert opinion. The data quality assessments framework
    based on DQDs date back to 1998. Total Data Quality Management (TDQM) by Wang
    [27] has been widely accepted within database management systems [28], [29] and
    within big data and IoT systems [30], [31], [32]. One of its core advantages is
    that it emphasizes an iterative approach to data quality management. Data users
    specify their requirements, and data engineers (information product engineers)
    translate these into DQDs that are measurable. Finally, expert knowledge is used
    to validate the requirements against the output of the engineers. Their implementation
    proposes 15 DQDs that can be applied to various domains and have been widely adopted.
    The evaluation of the framework is based on domain expert knowledge. Lee et al.
    [18] later proposed AIM quality (AIMQ) that is based on TDQM. The major contribution
    of this work classifies DQDs into four categories: 1) intrinsic; 2) contextual;
    3) representational; and 4) accessibility. Several other methodologies have also
    been proposed based on TDQM. While the solutions above are more general, more
    recently, Alrae et al. [33] proposed “House of Information Quality framework for
    IoT systems.” This differs from the above solutions in that it compares DQDs associated
    with information quality and the core IoT elements to define DQDs that are necessary
    for IoT applications. Like the above solutions, expert opinion is used as a significant
    validation method. This is a good validation strategy, but not good for runtime
    assessment. B. Application of DQDs This section highlights solutions that use
    DQDs to implement applications for assessing and improving that quality. In these,
    some have advanced a data-centric approach by trying to mitigate the errors in
    the data itself [34], [35], [36], and others have proposed a process-centric approach
    where the data collection process is assessed [3], [4], [5], [6]. Javed and Wolf
    [36] presented a technique that leverages spatial and temporal interpolation to
    identify outliers in sensor reading. They evaluate their solution using weather
    sensing and conclude that the same method can be used in any application domain
    where the underlying phenomenon is continuous. Tsai et al. [34] proposed an abnormal
    sensor detection architecture that leverages machine-learning techniques, using
    a trained Bayesian model that can predict values of sensor nodes via other correlated
    sensors. Their results show they can detect abnormal sensors in real-time. Vilenski
    et al. [35] looked at a multivariate anomaly detection technique for ensuring
    the data quality of dendrometer sensor networks. The anomalous sensors are identified
    statistically by comparing a sensor’s readings to an expected reading from a similar,
    healthy sensor network. As a gold standard, expert knowledge was used to assess
    the system. The above solutions address a single DQD (accuracy) by employing anomaly
    detection techniques. Contrary to the above, Kim et al. [37] used accurate and
    consistent DQDs and proposed a system for filtering data based on the sensing
    objects. By employing a Bayesian classifier, the classifier can filter sensing
    objects with inaccurate data and then deliver data with integrity to the server
    for analysis. The performance of the proposed data-filtering system is evaluated
    through computer simulation. This research identifies the necessity of addressing
    multiple DQDs and directs the work in this article for a general framework to
    apply multiple DQDs in assessment, with those DQDs specified by the end user.
    Current approaches are evaluated by either expert knowledge (Section III-A), by
    a unique process (Section III-B), or by bespoke gold standard reference measure
    for a given use case. The evaluation strategy is thus specific to the use case.
    Identifying a means to evaluate data quality assessment strategy via a benchmark
    remains an open challenge. Table II compares some of the previous research and
    the evaluation strategies used against the proposed approach. TABLE II Comparison
    of the Various Evaluation Strategies SECTION IV. Existing Challenges The approach
    to data quality assessment in this article is to investigate how the aspects of
    data quality affect the performance of each stage in the big data model and how
    this affects subsequent stages. To understand how data quality assessment proliferates
    and affects data use cases, it is essential to understand the relationship between
    data quality and the big data model. Thus far, the literature does not consider
    data quality as a fundamental aspect of the big data model. A challenge exists
    with regard to structuring DQDs within the big data model so that the effect of
    data quality is identified throughout the model. Currently, it is difficult to
    know which part of the big data model is responsible for what portion of the overall
    data quality score. These are referred to as structure-related challenges [2].
    With a given data quality structure in mind, considerations on how data quality
    measurements from one stage of the big data model can and should affect data quality
    measurements at other stages in the big data model. This may involve combining
    or weighting quality measurements for a given stage or use case. A number of challenges
    exist in this space and are referred to as method-related challenges. Implementing
    a given assessment structure and methodology into a data pipeline from end to
    end considering the uniqueness of each stage of the BDC remains a challenge. These
    are referred to as implementation challenges. A. Method-Related Challenges Data
    quality can be highly subjective. A single data point or source can have varying
    qualities depending on the use-case context. How might data quality be represented
    in a general manner throughout the big data model yet allow subjective assessment
    by two (or more) end users? Data quality is measured and represented in different
    forms depending on the stage and context within the big data model. How can these
    data quality measures be combined across the big data model stages to infer a
    quality metric which is useful for use-case quality determination? This article
    addresses these challenges by providing a means of decoupling the mechanics of
    providing a quality score and the methods of evaluating quality. B. Implementation-Related
    Challenges The current implementation of data collection/processing solutions
    for IoT and big data are based on a data pipeline. The BDC is broken down into
    a set of defined individual and independent services. For a data assessment solution
    to be feasible, it should be integrated into such data pipelines. Challenges exist
    in choosing the significant stages in the pipeline where data should be evaluated.
    Other challenges include, fusing different scores from independent stages of the
    data pipeline into a single score that can be used and advertised to applications.
    This would help explain the interrelationship of the various stages of the BDC
    and data quality issues. This article implements a naive approach of considering
    all the scores equally, but the goal is to investigate other fusion techniques.
    SECTION V. Rationale for Trust This section serves and provides the motivation
    for introducing trust as a driver for data quality measurement and incorporating
    data quality into the big data model. Trust has been used previously as a measure
    of data quality. Keßler and De Groot [38] studied how the quality of geographic
    information can be estimated through the notion of trust as a proxy measure. Trust
    is a unitless measure that can be used in composite metrics. A trust score can
    be used to represent the composite score of a chosen number of DQDs used to assess
    quality while representing a competitive score evaluating two (or more) sources.
    Moreover, trust based on previous events can help minimize the required processing
    time for real-time applications. Trust is expressed using the experience metric
    in the implementation of this article. Experience (e): Data quality is currently
    measured by evaluating over a period of data points and determining a quality
    score for an instance over this period. Real-time subscriptions to data streams
    are concerned with current data quality at the head of the stream. Assessing this
    quality over a period, up to the head of the stream can be expensive. Furthermore,
    this quality measure will age, requiring reevaluation. This article presents an
    experience metric (e) , based on a trust paradigm, which can be used to continuously
    assess quality at the head of a data stream with low overhead. Experience is modeled
    on the following properties of trust. Dynamic: Trust can increase or decrease
    with new experiences (usage or interactions). This feature has been modeled through
    different techniques. For example, in PeerTrust [39], they use an iterative windowing
    approach which allows users to customize the overall trust score by varying past
    and present experiences of an actor. In this article, the defined generic experience
    metric provides an innovative way to allow a data stream/data provider to build
    trust over time. This is different from the current data quality evaluation strategies
    that, while considering historical data, return an instantaneous metric. Personalized:
    This allows each data agent/consumer to customize its own trust metric by either
    assigning different weights to the metric or defining its own experience metric.
    This provides an innovative way to assess data quality based on the specifications
    of the data consumer. SECTION VI. Proposed Framework The framework is based on
    the properties of trust that can be improved over time to indicate good quality
    data whose quality threshold is acceptable for a certain use case. Trust itself
    is a continuous assessment process. Throughout this process, trust can be formed,
    improved, or lost. This article defines three trust stages for evaluating data
    quality. This was informed by previous research in the field [4]. Fig. 3 shows
    how these relate to the big data model. Initial trust: This is trust that is derived
    without investigating the data itself but rather the context of the data. This
    includes investigating the source and equipment/sensors used, and metadata are
    also assessed. Metadata plays a key role in determining quality. Sensor types,
    manufacturer, deployment age, and calibration technique are features that affect
    data quality. Investigation trust: Trust that is derived from the data itself.
    This can relate to the raw data stream or stages of preprocessing the data has
    undertaken. This, among other parameters, can encompass data completeness or accuracy.
    A component of this can consider comparative analysis, comparing the data stream
    values against a community of sensors or comparative data streams. Stages of preprocessing
    may involve data stream modeling or data fusion. Both modeling and fused data
    can be used and evaluated in comparative analysis for trust determination. Result-driven
    trust: Data are used in systems modeling and decision-making. The result of these
    products can be monitored as effective decisions or accurate models. This monitored
    result can be used as a feedback mechanism throughout the stages of the big data
    model to build trust. This relates to the propagative property of trust [40].
    The result-driven feedback is an important facet to build trust in the absence
    of a gold standard and in a shared data environment. Fig. 3. Flow diagram showing
    the relationship between the big data model and trust formation stages. Show All
    The initial trust would help us define a trust score that represents data quality
    during data collection. Investigative trust defines a trust score that represents
    data quality during data prepossessing and data analytics. Finally, result-driven
    trust defines a trust score that represents data quality during data analytics
    and other data use processes. This ensures that data quality is represented across
    the entire big data model. A proposed data quality assessment framework is shown
    in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed framework that is based on trust formation stage.
    Show All The framework defines three phases: 1) starting phase (SP); 2) investigation
    phase (IP); and 3) results phase (RP). These are explained further in Section
    VI-C. At each of the phases, a phase trust score is calculated; SP n , IP n ,
    RP n by combining parameters and weights. For example, SP (SPn) is calculated
    with parameters ( a 1 , a 2 ,…, a 3 ) and weights ( w 1 , w 2 ,…, w 3 ) . Table
    III presents a nonexhaustive list of parameters. This is completed for each of
    the phases with the respective parameters and weights. After determining a phase
    trust score, a use-case-specific threshold is defined. Such weights can be learned
    through feedback from the previous stage for a particular use case. This is used
    to model the effects of the phases on each other. The framework then combines
    these with the experience metric and outputs a single end-to-end trust metric
    that can be used to evaluate data quality. TABLE III Parameters at Each Phase
    A. Framework Phases Three phases are defined that relate to the trust formation
    process. First, the framework will evaluate the context of the data by looking
    at aspects of the data; origin of data (reputation of the source), metadata. Second,
    the framework examines the data itself, assessing quality issues that exist in
    the data. Finally, the framework assesses use-case-specific results and their
    applicability to data quality. A predictive model use case may compare real and
    predicted values and attribute trust based on this. At each phase, the framework
    defines parameters a 1 to a n that define the dimensions of data quality used
    at each stage. B. Determining Weights The framework applies a set of linear weights
    to the attributes at each stage. The weights can be learned through the feedback
    process from the previous stage. This ensures that each use case can uniquely
    customize its own quality experience. C. Formulation of the Trust Metric The mathematical
    definition of SP, IP, and RP is illustrated further in Section VIII-B. The trust
    score of a data stream i is defined as T i = SP i + IP i + RP i +e (1) View Source
    where e is a metric called experience defined below. 1) Experience ( e ) The proposed
    framework uses experience e to model the natural behavior of trust. This is motivated
    by work conducted by Gao et al. [41]. The experience score is driven by positive
    and negative experiences. Therefore, the metric e of a given data stream i is
    defined as e i = ϑ i +1 ϑ i + δ i +2 (2) View Source where ϑ i is the count of
    positive experience toward data stream i , and δ i is the count of negative experience
    toward data stream i . Consider a data stream i , it is said to have positive
    e at time t if the trust score at time t−1 is greater than a threshold, else i
    shows a negative experience. At t=0 , ( ϑ i + δ i =0) , this means that data stream
    is new or has just started streaming. Therefore, experience is set to e i =0.5
    . This is informed by previous research in the field [42]. SECTION VII. End-to-End
    Implementation The proposed framework is tested via an end-to- end implementation
    of the data pipeline that is based on industry standard technologies and practices.
    The application development follows a microservice-based architecture that decomposes
    the application into a small set of complete self-contained services. This ensures
    that the framework can be seamlessly designed into any pipeline. This implementation
    aims to achieve the following goals. Decouple the mechanics of providing or advertising
    a quality score from the methods of evaluating quality. This allows different,
    competing, or updated metrics to be used to calculate trust without affecting
    the scoring mechanism. Describe the placement of the trust framework into big
    data pipelines. Evaluate the feasibility of end-to-end data quality assessment
    in terms of computing resources. The end-to-end data pipeline shown in Fig. 5
    is composed of four system components: these are mapped from the four phases of
    the big data phases described in Section I. This section describes the role of
    each component and the technologies used in each. Fig. 5. End-to-end implementation
    of the data pipeline. Show All A. Data Collection This phase of the data pipeline
    is concerned with data producers or data sources. These could be live sensors
    streaming to the cloud, historical data coming from a data warehouse/database,
    or data coming from a third-party application programming interface (API). Both
    live stream and historical data sources (batch processing) were considered for
    testing and evaluation. B. Data Preprocessing Two operations take place in the
    preprocessing block; first, the calculation of the initial trust described in
    Section VI as part of the trust framework is applied. The system checks if the
    initial trust meets this stage’s application data quality requirements. If satisfied,
    each data stream is tagged as good data and passed on to a Kafka node. Otherwise,
    that data can be tagged as usable data. In this case, the data can be improved
    by subsequent processing, and else, the data is discarded. Deciding what constitutes
    usable data is still an open research question. Second, a producer–broker–consumer
    mechanism is set up to receive data from the data producers (sensors). This in
    turn will present the data to the next part of the data pipeline (consumer). In
    a typical IoT data-shared environment, it is expected that a single data source
    can share its data with one or several data consumers each with different data
    quality requirements. The need for parallel distributed processing where a single
    input data source can be processed independently by each application is supported
    by Kafka and Zookeeper. Kafka, a distributed messaging system that is used for
    collecting and delivering high volumes of data with low latency [43]. Zookeeper
    is an orchestration server for Kafka. Fig. 6 shows the high-level architecture
    of Kafka. In the proposed system, each data consumer (spark application, described
    in Section VII-C) initializes a Kafka topic. This is the name of the source(s)
    from which it expects to receive data. A single application can subscribe to one
    or many Kafka topics. Each data source can only publish a single topic. Both Kafka
    and Zookeeper are run as microservices running on docker containers. The system
    can scale both horizontally and vertically. Fig. 6. Distributed Kafka architecture.
    Show All C. Data Processing and Analytics Data processing, real-time modeling,
    and data storage are performed by the data processing and analytics cluster. The
    second phase of trust calculation is conducted in this system component. To achieve
    the functionality of this subcomponent, the data needs to be processed in real-time
    as it is received. A spark streaming service is used to handle real-time data.
    Spark streaming is part of the core spark API that allows for real-time processing
    of data from various sources including Kafka, Flume, and Amazon Kinesis. This
    processed data can then be saved to file systems, databases, live dashboards,
    or even pushed to a Kafka node as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Spark streaming application.
    Show All The setup consists of one master node with two workers. Each spark application
    is initialized with a list of topics to which it listens. Each topic corresponds
    to a data source name that is part of the IoT data-sharing ecosystem. Both historical
    and real-time data can be assessed using this implementation. Historical data
    can be assessed in batches defined by a period. Real-time data is assessed on
    a continuous basis windowed by a period or sample size. The following operations
    take place using the calculated trust score. The trust score from the previous
    phase is aggregated with that of the current phase. If the trust score is lower
    than a threshold, operations can be performed here to improve the overall quality
    and a new trust score calculated. If the data does not meet the quality standards
    of the application, the current data source will be deemed unusable. D. Data Use
    The final component of the data pipeline considers data use. Data use operations
    such as data visualization and machine learning are typically applied in the BDC.
    RP trust is calculated based on the output of such operations. This requires feedback
    from the application. The feedback loop would help define the longitudinal relationship
    between the data quality properties at each stage of the big data model, and how
    these might affect or help improve the overall data quality of a data stream.
    For example, a prediction model application may return a prediction error based
    on the current data pipeline used. SECTION VIII. Trust Framework by Example To
    demonstrate the application of the proposed system, an example based on a dataset
    from an IoT deployment collected to measure air quality was used. The air quality
    dataset is comprised of two data streams: a gold reference sensor stream and an
    IoT sensor stream. Both are colocated and measure the same feature (carbon monoxide
    (CO) concentration). From each of these streams, a continuous trust metric is
    formed. The trust metric is built using three DQDs: 1) accuracy; 2) completeness;
    and 3) timeliness. The implementation of each of the metrics is defined in Section
    VIII-B. At any given time, a value of trust is given to the stream based on these
    DQDs and past trust scores (experience). The example is presented to, first, provide
    an implementation of trust and show the dynamics of the trust metric when evaluating
    a data stream, and second, to test and validate the trust mechanism. This is achieved
    in three stages. First, the trust metric of the known gold standard data stream
    is compared against the trust metric for colocated IoT data stream. This test
    indicates how trust can be used as a metric over multiple DQDs to differentiate
    between sources of varying quality. Second, trust is compared to known data quality
    metrics MAE and RMSE. The comparison will validate trust as an indicator of data
    quality. Should the defined trust metric show a strong correlation with the known
    data quality metrics over a range of data streams, we may conclude that the trust
    metric can indeed be a usable quality metric. Finally, the resource costs of implementing
    trust as a continuous quality metric are evaluated. The first evaluation is based
    on data from a CO sensor (referred to as the low-cost sensor) and a gold reference
    sensor. These are colocated and measure the same property. For each stream, DQDs
    at each stage are defined. These are used to calculate the trust score and subsequently
    experience for each stage. Finally, result scores from the initial and investigative
    stages are fused, resulting in a trust score for a stream. A naive approach using
    equal weighting linear fusion is applied in this example. Further investigation
    into fusion techniques will be conducted in future work. A second evaluation is
    based on the gold reference stream. The goal is to have a standard and generic
    way of evaluating data quality frameworks that are based on model performance.
    Models are usually the final step of most IoT data processes, and the previous
    research has shown a correlation between data quality and model performance [44].
    This can help establish a benchmark for all data quality frameworks across the
    IoT. The stream is modeled to generate five streams. The first stream is the original
    stream (no noise added). The other five streams are generated by randomly introducing
    noise to the original stream in varying proportions of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30%.
    The percentage is the overall size of the data stream. To generate the noise,
    NumPy’s random function was used [45]. This is based on the normal distribution
    and draws random samples. The size of the sample corresponds to the proportion
    of error, for example, 10%. The generated noise is then added to the original
    stream to create a new stream. For each stream, a trust metric is calculated.
    For each stream, a model is built and evaluated with two known metrics: 1) RMSE
    and 2) MAE. The framework is agnostic of the modeling technique. This example
    uses an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). A relationship exists
    between data quality and model performance [44]. As the data quality degrades,
    so does model performance, keeping other factors constant. This relationship is
    used as a way to evaluate the trust metric. If this relationship exists between
    the calculated trust metric and data quality, it can be concluded that the trust
    metric is a valid metric for describing data quality. Fig. 8 summarizes the data
    and process flow of the example. Fig. 8. Data and process flow of the example.
    Show All The final evaluation measures how the system resources are utilized as
    the data go through the data pipeline. Central processing unit (CPU) utilization
    of the system without the trust calculation and CPU utilization with the calculation
    of trust at each stage are compared. The delay introduced by trust calculation
    is also measured. The results and evaluations reported in is study are based on
    the starting and investigation phases of the framework highlighted in Fig. 4.
    The mechanism for the RP is still under study. In the SP, one DQD is considered,
    timeliness, and two DQDs in the IP, completeness and accuracy. To differ from
    previous studies that use the same DQDs by taking into account only the current
    state of a data stream, our implementation uses a trust approach based on past
    and present experience. Karkouch et al. [46] reported that because of the instantaneous
    nature of these DQDs, at some point, they will be either unreliable or become
    insignificant. For example, if a sensor dirty fails (sensor node fails, but keeps
    up reporting readings that are erroneous) under any circumstances, then the accuracy
    dimension is rendered insignificant and unreliable unless it is enhanced with
    past experience. These metrics are defined in Section VI-C. This implementation
    considers uniform weights for each DQD. Effective weight determination is still
    an open research question. A. Dataset Description The study uses a publicly available
    dataset that was collected from an IoT deployment (see reference [47]). A multisensor
    device was colocated with a conventional air pollution analyzer. This was used
    to provide the true concentration values of the target pollutants at the measurement
    site. These values were thus used as a gold standard. This dataset is suitable
    for testing as the discrepancies in quality between the streams are known and
    can be used for system evaluation. This study uses data from the CO sensor (referred
    to as a low-cost sensor) and the gold reference sensor. Fig. 9 shows hourly concentration
    estimation of CO over a one-week window. The red line represents the true concentration
    value as measured by the conventional analyzer colocated with the low-cost sensor
    whose values are shown by the blue line. Fig. 9. Hourly concentration measures
    of CO for the gold standard and low-cost sensors. Show All B. Mathematical Implementation
    A previous study [2] examines if a trust-based framework can be used to evaluate
    the quality of a data stream without a gold reference. This study expands on this
    to consider the first two phases (SP and IP) of the framework. This work is different
    from the previous study in that it implements evaluation over the big data model,
    evaluating a fundamental component of the proposed framework. The implementation
    and evaluation are conducted over two phases using: 1) timeliness and 2) accuracy
    and completeness DQDs. Following from (1), SPi and IPi are given by SP i = IP
    i = ( Timeliness )( w 1 ) ( Accuracy Completeness )( w 1 w 2 ). (3) (4) View Source
    1) Accuracy: This is widely considered as meaning a correct and unambiguous correspondence
    with the real world [48]. Ballou and Pazer [49] defined accuracy as the recorded
    value being in conformity with the actual value. This work defines the metric
    for accuracy following the definition by Blake and Mangiameli [48]: Accuracy:=1−
    V T N A (5) View Source where V T is the number of tuples in a relation having
    one or more incorrect values and N A is the total number of tuples. To determine
    V T , a statistical technique based on median absolute deviations (MADs) is used.
    Absolute deviation from the median has been used for a long time to filter outliers
    [50]. The median is a measure of central tendency and is preferred to the mean
    as it is less sensitive to the presence of outliers which can have an outsized
    effect in IoT. The median is also a location estimator that has the highest breakdown
    point. The following formula as defined by Huber [51] was used to calculate MAD:
    MAD=α M i (| x i − M j ( x j )|) (6) View Source where x j is the original observations,
    M j is the median of the series, and α is the data normalization constant defined
    by [52]. It is defined as α=(1/(Q(0.75)) , where Q(0.75) is the 0.75 quintile
    of that underlying distribution. The normalization step is important because otherwise
    MAD would estimate the scale up to a multiplicative constant [51] only. Fig. 10
    illustrates how the MAD was used to determine V T . To determine the tolerance
    factor, Miller [53] suggested three values: 2, 2.5, and 3 standard deviations.
    The choice will determine the sensitivity of the metric. Since IoT data is noisy,
    the extreme value of 3 was used to ensure that noisy data are not tagged as outliers.
    Fig. 10. Illustration of how MAD is implemented. Show All 2) Completeness: The
    metric for completeness is given by [48] and is defined as follows: on the level
    of data values, a data value is incomplete (i.e., the metric value is zero) if
    and only if it is “NULL”; otherwise, it is complete (i.e., the metric value is
    one). All data values that represent missing or unknown values in a specific application
    scenario (e.g., blank spaces or “9/9/9999” as a date value) are represented by
    the data value “NULL. ” For a relation R , let T R be the number of tuples in
    R that have at least one “NULL” value and let N R be the total number of tuples
    in R . Then, the completeness of R is defined as follows: Completeness:=1− T R
    N R = N R − T R N R . (7) View Source 3) Timeliness: The parameter for timelines
    of a data stream is affected by two components: currency, referring to the lag
    between when the data point was produced and when it was used or processed. The
    second, volatility, refers to how long the data point remains valid [54]. For
    some applications like accident avoidance in autonomous vehicles, this is very
    important. In others such as disease prediction in smart agriculture, the currency
    is less important. Unlike accuracy and completeness, timeliness is not determined
    directly from the data but rather by the context of the data. To this end, the
    metric for timelines is defined as Timeliness=[max(1− currency volatility ),0].
    (8) View Source C. Weighting the Scores Previous works [2] have two main drawbacks.
    Both previous and current experiences are weighted equally. The natural norm of
    trust assigns more weight to previous experiences when compared to current ones.
    The trust curve is biased by sudden changes in the data properties. The desired
    effect would be a gradual change for small changes in the data properties, with
    larger variations in trust occurring from larger data property changes. To mitigate
    the above effects, a weighted moving average that assigns more weight to past
    experiences when compared to current experiences is applied. This also reduces
    the effects of sudden increases and decreases in the trust curve due to small
    changes. Fig. 11 compares the trust score before and after weighting. The highlighted
    area shows how the effects of weights mitigate the above challenges. This is important
    in data-shared IoT where data is noisy and sudden changes in the data do not always
    relate to poor quality data. Fig. 11. Weighting trust scores using weighted moving
    average. Show All SECTION IX. Results and Evaluations To evaluate the trust metric,
    an experiment was set up to compare the trust metric to known statistical measures.
    The ARIMA forecasting model was used. Although multiple factors dictate a model’s
    performance, it is argued that the quality of the data that goes into the model
    is of most importance [44]. As the data quality changes, the assumption is that
    so does the model’s overall performance. Using the original gold reference stream,
    a trust score was calculated. Also, an ARIMA model is built and tested for the
    same stream. The results of the trust score are then compared to the RMSE and
    MAE. The process is repeated for the other generated streams. The correlation
    measures were based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. As it can be seen
    from both Table IV and Fig. 12, there is a strong negative correlation between
    the trust score and the RMSE and MAE. As the quality of the data degrades, the
    performance of the ARIMA model decreases. This is indicated by the increase in
    the values of RMSE and MAE. The same relationship exists between the trust score
    and data quality. As the quality of data degrades, so does the trust score. This
    shows that the proposed trust metric can act equivalently as known metrics like
    the RMSE. It is important to note that the trust metric is calculated without
    reference to a gold standard. This presents a significant opportunity to measure
    data quality in shared IoT where there is no gold reference to compare. TABLE
    IV Pearson Correlation Coefficients Between the Trust Score, RMSE, and MAE Fig.
    12. Comparing how the trust score, RMSE, and MAE changes in data impurities. Show
    All The metric for RMSE and MAE are solely based on the accuracy of DQDs. It was,
    therefore, not possible to evaluate how completeness and timeliness would affect
    such metrics. Trust metric, however, is a multidimensional metric that incorporates
    several DQDs depending on the user’s needs and application. This further illustrates
    the need for new ways to evaluate data quality. Future work will explore how to
    effectively compare the trust metric to other multidimensional metrics that support
    several DQDs. Fig. 13 presents the data quality differences between the gold reference
    sensor and the low-quality sensor. The aim here was to differentiate between two
    known data quality streams: 1) the gold reference and 2) the low-cost sensor.
    The green highlight in the Fig. 13 shows how both the gold reference and low-quality
    sensor’s trust decrease. During this period, the number of outliers increased
    by 2% for both the gold reference and low-quality sensors. The number of missing
    values, however, increased by 3% and 2% for gold reference and low-quality sensors,
    respectively. This accounts for the reduction in the trust scores for both sensors.
    Fig. 13. Comparing trust scores for the gold reference sensor and low-cost sensor.
    Show All In the first red highlight, there are inconsistencies in the trust scores
    for the gold reference and low-quality sensors, with that of the low-quality sensor
    being lower. During this period, the data authors [47] reported that after the
    30th week (starting march 2004), there was sensor drifting. This was later corrected
    by the calibration of the sensors. This sensor drift was detected by the trust
    mechanism and resulted in a lower trust score for this period. After calibration,
    the trust score returns to high values. The detection of sensor drift and its
    impact on data quality has previously shown to be difficult to measure. In the
    last red highlight, there was a 13% increase in the number of missing values for
    the low-quality sensor. This explains the overall decrease in the trust score
    during this period. The trust metric, therefore, helps describe the quality of
    each data stream independently without relying on the other and shows the effects
    of different DQDs in a single metric. This type of comparison over multiple DQDs
    is not possible with existing techniques. As part of the evaluation process, the
    impact of the trust computation framework on the data pipeline in terms of system
    resources (percentage CPU usage) and the delay introduced in the data pipeline
    due to trust calculation was monitored. Fig. 14 shows a higher percentage usage
    of compute resources for a data pipeline with trust computation when compared
    to the same job without trust computation. On average, there was a 7.8% increase
    in CPU usage for jobs with trust calculation. On average, there is a delay introduced
    into the data pipeline due to trust calculation. This is not an in- process delay,
    but rather compounded total delay from the start of the job to the end. Not with
    standing this the data is still delivered. The results reported here compare system
    performance as the number of nodes in the clusters increases (up to four worker
    nodes). Each of the worker’s nodes has six cores and 4 GB. As shown in Table V,
    as the number of worker nodes increases, the delay decreases from 10.6 to 4.2
    min. Since the delay is caused by an extra process (trust calculation), and spark
    is a distributed processing engine, increasing the number of nodes in the cluster
    would minimize or even eliminate such a delay. This demonstrates the scalability
    of the system. TABLE V System Resource Utilization Fig. 14. Comparing data pipeline
    resource consumption. Show All SECTION X. Application: When to Disconnect From
    a Data Source Data deriving from IoT can help foster innovations and save lives.
    Performing analytics on this data is, however, challenging due to the heterogeneity,
    complexity, and dynamic nature of IoT. Therefore, businesses and organizations
    have to maintain redundant data sources, seek third-party sources, or a few that
    can afford them, and install high-end sensors to mitigate such heterogeneity within
    the data. The process of deciding which data source to engage and disengage is
    largely based on the quality of data from such a source. This is typically performed
    manually after the data has been processed. Data generation, collection, and delivery
    in IoT are automated and so should the process of selecting and maintaining a
    data source. Current data quality metrics are instantaneous, that is, a data source
    is evaluated based on its current state only, without previous context. Given
    the dynamic, heterogeneity, and high volatility of IoT data, this would result
    in a high variance in network connection due to disconnecting from a data source
    each time there is a change in the data properties. This problem is exacerbated
    by low bandwidth and intermittent network disruptions that affect most IoT deployments.
    The trust metric, however, has been modeled to mitigate this problem. One of the
    novel elements of the trust score is its experience metric. This helps to incorporate
    the past and current context of a data source and also ensures that sudden changes
    in the data properties do not lead to sudden changes in the trust metric. This
    feature is further improved by the weighting strategy implemented in Section VIII-C.
    To illustrate the application, data collected from weather stations between 2015
    and 2019 in the United Kingdom was used. The data is produced at an interval of
    15 min. Each weather station generates an average of 30000 data points every year
    with over 100 weather stations. This includes air temperature, rainfall, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. Agricultural applications dynamically connect to and
    retrieve data from these stations. In a data-shared IoT environment, applications
    should be able to dynamically select a data source, a weather station, for example,
    based on its data quality needs. Figs. 15 and 16 show two applications each with
    a different trust score threshold (0.98 and 0.95), each connected to a different
    weather station. Each application would advertise its threshold. In each case,
    the application would then automatically disengage from the data source when its
    trust score falls below the application’s threshold and would automatically be
    connected to another data source of sufficient quality. While the thresholds determined
    in the figures are somewhat arbitrary, the method can be used to allow different
    applications to prescribe different levels of quality for their given use case.
    Each application and use case can set its own threshold. This can then be used
    to disengage from a data source. Fig. 15. Application with a higher threshold.
    Show All Fig. 16. Application with a lower threshold. Show All This kind of automation
    can be used in other applications, for example: Automate data source repairs and
    maintenance. Continued disengagement from a data source could mean it is faulty.
    Gradual decrease in data quality could be associated with sensor drift. Therefore,
    the sensor can be automatically reset back to where its known data quality was
    good. SECTION XI. Conclusion and Future Work This article has described an end-to-
    end implementation of a trust framework that can be used to estimate the quality
    of data. The implementation was evaluated using data collected from a real-world
    experiment. The implementation is based on industry-standard data pipelines with
    Kafka as distributed messaging service and Apache Spark for real-time data processing.
    This is unique as it integrates with all the stages of the big data model. To
    the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end data quality assessment
    framework implementation. This implementation enables one to estimate data quality
    in cases where there is no gold standard to compare. The other advantage is that
    one would be able to represent data quality in a general manner throughout the
    big data model. To evaluate the system, the article compares the trust score to
    RMSE and MAE. Using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, the results and evaluations
    showed that the trust metric is a good metric for data quality assessment in cases
    where there is no gold standard, which is the case in data-shared IoT. Although
    the results have shown a slight increase in system resources in terms of CPU and
    execution time, this can be mitigated with distributed processing. The article
    listed several challenges related to data quality assessment, both structural
    and method-related challenges. We have explored how some of these can be solved
    by the implementation described using real-world datasets. However, some challenges
    remain: for example, we equally combine the trust scores for the different phases.
    There is a need for a fusion algorithm that accounts for the contribution of each
    stage. Also, the mechanism for feedback and how this propagates from the RP is
    not yet fully formed. These and other challenges highlighted above form part of
    our future work. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    4.0, Water ManagementSustainability Introduction Agriculture must change. The
    excessive use of phytosanitary products, soil tillage techniques, and production
    must necessarily adapt to meet current challenges. Climate change, depletion of
    fossil resources, environmental issues (protection of biodiversity, fight against
    pollution, etc.), and health require a change of model to tend towards more sustainability
    [1], [2]. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is taking advantage
    of recent advances in energy consumption in electronic systems and energy harvesting
    technologies to build intelligent control entities used in various fields such
    as agriculture [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Thanks to the ever-lower
    power consumption of radiofrequency communication circuits, it is possible to
    create networks of sensor systems capable of extracting data from the environment
    and transmitting it to a master entity. However, the limited lifetimes of batteries
    are an obstacle to developing such networks for cost and difficulty of maintenance.
    On the other hand, thanks to the energy recovery in the environment, whether solar,
    thermal, or mechanical, it is possible to power a sensor system and its wireless
    communication to increase the network''s overall autonomy [11], [12], [13], [14],
    [15]. Energy harvesting provides an attractive solution for IoT applications such
    as low-power wireless sensor systems, enabling fully wireless devices to be deployed,
    requiring little or no maintenance. However, these devices generally still need
    a rechargeable battery or a supercapacitor to meet peak power demands. Energy
    harvesting designates a technology intended to capture energy from the environment
    (or human activity) in order to be able to then operate an electronic device.
    Like renewable energies, energy harvesting enhances the energy sources naturally
    present in our environment. This technology provides a reasonably limited power
    (of the order of a few watts only) but is thus ideally suited for connected objects,
    which consume little energy. In addition, several energies can be harvested for
    energy harvesting. This is particularly the case with solar energy, wind power,
    thermal energy, and energy from vibrations. Renewable energy harvesting came from
    agricultural residues and energy crops for innovative agriculture applications
    [16]. For several years, many researchers have strived to find new sources of
    energy that are always “cleaner” and more environmentally friendly. Capable of
    transforming chemical energy into electrical energy, the biofuel cell differs
    from its predecessor in its composition: 100% natural components, therefore biodegradable,
    far from the harmful and polluting effects of metals such as manganese or platinum.
    Glucose, bacteria, and even plants are now the ambassadors of more environmentally
    friendly biofuel cells. There have been many works that have used renewable energy
    sources for agricultural applications to extend network lifetime. Faced with environmental
    pollution, innovative solutions are increasingly sought to change our modes of
    production and consumption of energy. For example, scientists have found in energy
    harvesting a way to produce batteries that are not harmful to the environment:
    biopiles. The latter is different from traditional batteries by their composition.
    Made of natural components, the biopile draws its energy from the environment
    without polluting it in return. Plants, glucose, and even bacteria can be used
    to create a 100% biodegradable battery. The latter uses chemical energy to generate
    electrical power. IoT sensors, ranging from simple thermometers to drones, have
    been democratized on farms. They can now collect a multitude of information from
    across the farm and transmit real-time data on the condition and performance of
    machinery, crops, and animals. The acquisition of a large volume of data is the
    basis of Agriculture 4.0. Nevertheless, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential
    to extract the full richness of this data. AI is, therefore, the lever that will
    enable tomorrow''s connected farmers to be supported throughout their production
    activities and to optimize their economic performance while reducing their environmental
    impact. The collection of data on the whole farm and the integration of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) algorithms will provide more and more valuable services to optimize
    the management of a farm. These tools will allow understanding of certain situations,
    making decisions more quickly, and capitalizing on the phenomena and the problems
    already encountered. The objectives are to reduce the drudgery of work, to produce
    more while minimizing costs and environmental impact. However, the farmer will
    remain the sole decision-maker for all strategic tasks, and each farmer will be
    able to choose and personalize his production path. The business expertise will
    always complement the information provided by AI. Moreover, the time saved by
    all these tools will allow the farmer to concentrate on the tasks requiring imperative
    human intervention. In this work a conceptual solution for the agricultural process
    was proposed at data management''s level. The Oracle Database 11 g was used. The
    solution stores rainfall, temperature, and drought status in the raw format described
    by farmers. In addition, Excel files were used to fill in the crop statistics
    data. Furthermore, we proposed an AI-based architecture for Smart Farming. This
    architecture called, Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture (SFOBA), should
    be designed to guarantee the system''s durability, the employment of the data
    modeling to transform the business needs for smart farming into analytics. The
    goal is to provide a strategy for data ingestion that meets the data model while
    processing and storing the farm data, considering the Data Quality management
    and the System Configuration. The proposed architecture is built in layers to
    guarantee sustainability. It should handle the variety of sources and the large
    workloads considering the fault tolerance. Each data source has its particularity
    regarding data structure and types that should be handled at the data model''s
    level. Intelligent farming analytics requires processing data in batch and real-time.
    The architecture should enable these capabilities, whether on-premise or on a
    cloud platform. That allows farmers to have more flexibility while accessing the
    data (from Smartphones, Tablets, etc.) using only the internet connection. The
    solution also requires having a single “source of truth” to all the intelligent
    farming analytics, the data lake (built-in layers). All technical controls and
    farming business rules verifications can be easily executed with this solution.
    It also allows to detect the data anomalies and cleaning them before storing them.
    Data scientists and data visualization tools will also process the farmers. This
    paper will be organized as follows: Section “Data Modeling for Smart Farming”
    exploits the difference between the most crucial data modeling methodologies Ralph-Kimball
    and Data vault and determining which one fits better the smarting farming analytics.
    Section “Data Migration Strategy for Smart Farming” focuses on the data migration
    strategies. Section “Smart Farming Oriented Big Data Architecture” describes the
    data ingestion strategy along with the smart farming-oriented Big Data Architecture.
    An overview of data science in smart agriculture is given in Section “Data Science
    for Smart Farming”. Section “Predictive Maintenance in Smart Farming” describes
    the algorithm for smart farming analysis and predictive maintenance. Finally,
    we conclude the paper in Section “Conclusion”. Data modeling for smart farming
    The success of data-driven analytics for smart farming is related to how organized
    the data management. This, in turn, means developing actions, policies, and architectures
    to manage the fundamental requirements of the data life cycle of the farm in a
    proper manner and align the technologies with the farming business needs. The
    development of data architecture for smart-farming involves accurate rules, data
    models, data storage, data processing, and integration [17], [18], [19], [20],
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Therefore, a well-designed data model should be
    built to define and analyze the data requirements. This includes: (1) the farm
    databases/sources; (2) the relationships between the data items; (3) data constraints;
    (4) conceptual representation of the data-Structure. When it comes to big data
    modeling, some of these gaps should be addressed in priority: (1) Integrating
    the existing farming data with the new one, on top of a Hadoop architecture, (2)
    Making the farm''s data available for processing in multitenant-infrastructures
    and accessible via shared access; (3) Supporting writable serialization format
    (used by Hadoop) and other serialization frameworks, e.g., Avro, Thrift, and Protocol
    Buffers; (4) Supporting columnar formats; (5) Compression (e.g., LZO, Snappy,
    Gzip, bzip2) improves data processing performance and reduces storage requirements.
    Thus, the farming business requirements should be “melt” within the logical data
    model. Then, determine how the various farm data sources will fit together and
    how they can be mapped to flow in one source (the farm data lake). The relational
    data model was proposed to represent data in tables to reduce the complexity of
    the “previous” hierarchical model and deliver a comprehensible overview of the
    data. In the same context, the transactional data model can be built to store
    discrete data of the “farm” business transactions like inventory, purchase orders,
    sales, etc. It is mainly how the DMP (data management platform) are modeled in
    their source system, throughout the procedure of normalizing the large raw-tables
    and splitting them into smaller ones, then creating relationships between these
    tables using reference integrity constraints and respecting the 3 Normal Forms
    (3NF). However, the problem with this approach in smart farming analytics that
    it is area/business specific where each database stores only the data related
    to a specific functional area. On the other hand, smart farming analytics necessitates
    storing transactional data for multiple regions like spatial distribution (including
    climate, productivity, and global-issues data), water management, and mechanical
    system maintenance in a single “target” source (data lake). The second problem
    is that transactional databases use the primary key (specially to normalize the
    data). Still, in smart farming, the DGM (Data Generated by Machine) and DHO (Data
    from Human Origin) come without a primary key. As a result, we will have duplicates
    in our tables, which will have a significant impact on the analytics and the decisions.
    The third problem is that retrieving data from a normalized database will involve
    many joins across these many split tables where various pieces of the farm data
    are stored. But for smart farming, the analysis and the analytics should be conducted
    and refreshed continuously and in near-real-time where data supposed to be retrieved
    in the shortest time possible. Thus, denormalizing the tables will significantly
    enhance the data-retrieval by adding redundancy (copying values between tables)
    to the farm''s data lake and reducing the number of joins on the queries. In addition,
    this denormalization will provide aggregation and calculation capabilities to
    the analysis and help extend calculated values for smart farming analytics. It
    is also essential to consider that most DHOs and some of the DMPs come in Excel
    files, stored in a flat raw table. That will limit the flexibility and the scalability
    and is challenging to query on, especially when dealing with big data. Also, the
    visibility of the dimension attributes will be challenging. These requirements
    can be considered as the opposite of the “relational” requirements. Both are defined
    by the so-called “Ralph Kimball Approach” of dimensional modeling. Each dimension
    will include fields for every related row. They will be built separately in dimension
    tables to have fewer rows to query each size, unlike the OBT. Besides, the Ralph-Kimball
    Star-Schema approach provides a flatter design than the Relational approach, where
    the data is separated to its nearly-all granular level to divers’ relationships.
    From a smart farming perspective, the star schema will consider the farming processes
    as fact, e.g., spatial distribution, water management or mechanical system maintenance,
    and dimensions, e.g., geography, time, crop-type, etc. Ordinarily, in this case,
    the star schema will contain these two levels, a simplified design for smart farming
    analytics, as shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (236KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Star Schema for Measurement Trends of the Mechanical
    System. But for spatial distribution, the agriculture season is an important axis
    of analysis that requires more granularity level of the time dimension. At the
    same time, especially for large-farming enterprises, they might have sections
    in different continents, countries, states, and cities. We have to study the climate,
    crop production, productivity, and crop distribution in every district necessitate
    descending into a significantly lower level of granularity of the dimension geography.
    This category of arrangement/configuration is referred to as snowflake schema,
    as described in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 2. Snowflake schema for the spatial distribution.
    The historical data is also an essential factor for the success of the analysis
    and prediction-based analytics. These data allow the farmers to track their processes
    and transactions, equipment, the historical water consumption data to predict
    future consumption. The star schema has few limitations when dealing with these
    historical “big” data because it requires cleansed data highly. The star schema
    doesn''t scale well when upstream systems change. Here where the data vault 2.0
    comes into the picture that shows better performance than 3NF and dimensional
    modeling to create historical data for the smart farming analytics as well as
    master data management. The data vault 2.0 is considered a business intelligence
    system that offers a massively parallel-architecture for big data, unstructured
    data, and real-time processing through data warehousing. The constituent that
    incorporates a data model can deal with multi latency and cross-platform data
    persistence, including disciplined Agile deliveries (based on Agile methodology).
    It is also important to mention that a star schema can be built from a business
    data vault. The data vault has three main types of tables: HUB: Contains a business-key
    list, each one has a surrogate key, along with a metadata describing the source
    system, the origin of the business keys, and the time; 2. LINK: to set up relationships
    between these business keys (ordinarily it describes a relationship of many-to-many),
    these links are essential to deal with granularity changes and lessen the impact
    of appending a new business key to a “linked” HUB; 3. SAT / Satellites: similarly,
    to Ralph-Kimball SCD type II the SAT carries the descriptive attributes and can
    change over time. The LINKs and HUBs form the structure of the data model. The
    SATs include temporary descriptive attributes and the metadata that links them
    to the parent LINK or HUB table. This mechanism gives strong historical capabilities
    by authorizing queries to go back in time, based on the metadata attributes inside
    an SAT table that contains a date where the record becomes valid and another date
    where it is expired. The data vault model consists of the following tables: HUB_SECTION,
    HUB_EQUIPMENT, LNK_SECQUIPMENT, SAT_SECTION, SAT_ADDRESS, and SAT_EQUIPMEN. Fig.

    strategy for smart farming In this section, we propose a smart farming-oriented
    big data Architecture or SFOBA along with the Data Ingestion Strategy that will
    be performed on top of it and the technical component base on their performance.
    Hadoop architecture Thanks to the MapReduce framework of the Hadoop ecosystem,
    the massive farm data can be distributed and replicated across multiple nodes,
    processed in parallel, modeled, and stored. This will guarantee high availability
    and more scalability compared to the traditional decision-making systems. Hadoop
    has three main components: (1) HDFS: which is a Hadoop Distributed File System;
    (2) YARN: which is a distributed operating system; (3). MapReduce: a framework
    for writing and processing data in a Hadoop environment. The main components of
    this architecture are: Resource Manager: For each cluster, a resource manager
    receives and runs the applications—one of its prominent roles in handling resource
    allocation and keeping track of the total resources and nodes. Application Master:
    takes responsibility for managing the execution of the MapReduce jobs (for each
    job, a worker node will act as application master). Job History Server: will provide
    information about the completed jobs. Node Manager: For each data node, there
    is a node manager. This node replaced the Task Tracker in Hadoop 1.x), which manages
    resources and deployment on a node. NameNode: is responsible for making all the
    decisions about block replication. It is responsible for managing the file system
    metadata, monitoring the blocks replication, performing operations (e.g., close,
    open, rename a file) related to the file system namespace, determining the mapping
    between the blocks and DataNodes. And there is a Secondary NameNode that can be
    optional, but it is very important for guaranteeing the High-Availability when
    the NameNode is down. Technical constraints From a Smart-Farming-Analytics perspective,
    the quality of this data cannot be expected, which will significantly impact the
    accuracy of the analytics. Therefore, handling data quality should be one of the
    top priorities when building the data architecture for smart-farming [26], [27],
    [28], [29], [30]. The computation performance in the Hadoop environment has been
    the subject of many works. For example, the result of Rattanaopas et al. [31]
    has compared multiple compression algorithms to improve computation performance
    and increase the storage space while compressing large-small files in a Hadoop
    environment. On a WordCount example, bzip2 outperformed the other algorithms gzip,
    snappy, LZ4 in terms of computation performance and saved the space of the storage
    70% more than a raw HDFS text file (which still shows better computation performance).
    Smart farming oriented big data architecture Hadoop solutions for smart farming
    analytics can be effective alongside a data migration strategy that intercalates
    data-modeling, data processing, data storage, data governance, and data quality,
    as well as the administration/configuration of the Hadoop-System on top of a data
    architecture that meets all these requirements and answers all the technical constraints.
    However, the proposed solutions employed Hadoop technologies in agriculture to
    handle the massive and various farm data and relieve the traditional decision-making
    systems'' limitations. The Hadoop solutions by sticking up couple clusters, grouping
    them, and then installing the needed tools for the analytics might or might not
    be profitable as a solution, especially for the sustainability of the smart farming
    analytics system. Given the fact, a Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture
    (SFOBA) should be designed to guarantee the durability of the system, the employment
    of the data modeling to transform the business needs for smart farming into analytics.
    The goal is to provide a strategy for data ingestion that meets the data model
    while processing and storing the farm data, considering the data quality management
    and the system configuration. The proposed architecture should be built in layers
    to guarantee the system''s sustainability. It should handle the variety of sources
    as well as the large workloads considering the Fault-Tolerance. Each data source
    has its particularity regarding data structure and data types that should be handled
    at the Data Model''s level. Smart farming analytics requires processing data in
    batch and real-time. These capabilities should be enabled by the architecture,
    whether on-premise or on a cloud platform. That allows farmers to have more flexibility
    while accessing the data (from Smartphones, Tablets, etc.) using only the Internet
    connection. The solution also requires having a single “source of truth” to all
    the smart farming analytics KPIs, the data lake (built-in layers). With this solution,
    all technical controls and farming business rules verifications can be easily
    executed. It also allows to detect of the anomalies on the data and clean it before
    storing it. The farmers will also be able to be processed by data scientists and
    data visualization tools. In the field of big data, there are three main types
    of architecture from which our SFOBA was inspired: A- Data Lake: is designated
    for processing and storing large volumes of data “mainly” in batch, where raw
    data can be in different formats structured, semi-structured or unstructured.
    This architecture comprises four layers: 1. Data Sources (e.g., Files, Web services,
    Logs, etc.); 2. Ingestion-System: workflow for data ingestion based on Spark,
    Sqoop, Kafka, and other technologies; 3. Data Lake: Which is the Hadoop Data Warehouse
    where the data will be stored; 4. The layer of Interrogation: These will be performed
    based on Hive SQL, Spark SQL, HBase, etc. B- Lambda Architecture: it was aimed
    at handling batch processing within data blocks and real-time processing continually
    depending on the data flow. This architecture is not mainly made for data storage.
    Still, it focuses on joining the massive batch data stored on the Batch Layer
    with the streaming data from the real time / speed layer that will be calculated
    or incremented on dedicated views. Finally, there is a serving layer where the
    client will have direct access to the needed views for the analytics. 3-Kappa
    Architecture: since the Lambda-Architecture is a bit complex because of the merge
    between the batch and streaming layers, the Kappa architecture was designed for
    data processing only without storing the data permanently. This architecture considers:
    (1) data source layer; (2) real time layer where data pipelines will build generally
    using Kafka to store the current messages that will be processed Spark, Storm,
    or other technologies; (3) a layer of views which are the output of the data processing;
    (4) a service layer where data can be queried on using Hive, HBase, Cassandra,
    etc. A recent solution called “delta lake”, an open-source project introduced
    by Databricks that answers many problems cited in the literature. It is a flow
    management mechanism of the data pipeline from data sources to the data lake and
    vice versa, based on the Databricks File System (DBFS) and Apache Spark to provide
    a Transactional-Storage. The main idea is to provide an abstraction layer of the
    data lake that relays on a Spark Optimized Table (SOT) that supports parquet type
    files and manages logs that monitor the table’s changes. The main challenges with
    Delta Lake are: 1. Ensuring the schema enforcement while introducing a new table;
    2. Repairing the newly created tables (mainly hive tables); 3. Refreshing the
    Metadata frequently (to avoid having the data ingested without being able to query
    on it because of the metadata updates); 4. Traffics of small files, especially
    for Distributed Computations; 5. The struggle of sorting the data by index (e.g.,
    an I.D.) where data is partitioned (e.g., by time) and distributed across multiple
    files. This Delta Lake solution provides many advantages, especially for ACID
    transactions. Many jobs can write and modify the target table (or dataset) simultaneously
    and get a consistent view. Also, the reading jobs will not interfere while writing/revising
    the dataset. The Automatic File Management accelerates the data access by grouping
    the data into larger files that can be read effectively. In the solution, we took
    the best of these techniques and adapted them for the Smart-Farming-Analytics.
    To prevent our Data Lake from drowning in the massive farm data. The SFOBA, as
    shown in Fig. 4, which lambda inspires for the fact that the query = function(farming-physical-data-model),
    is built based on five horizontal layers (as described below) where each one has
    its functionalities and performs specific write and read actions upon the previous
    layer. This architecture allows for more agility, flexibility in security maintenance,
    and well management for the data of different formats and historical data [32].
    1. The first layer is a Shared Area: that can also be considered as a landing
    area, which is built on top of a network file system (NFS), containing a structured
    folder based on the farming business logic. This shared area is not a schema but
    a group of folders on NFS that are oriented to save data temporarily. Thus, this
    Shared-Area should have more drivers and more space for storage. In most cases,
    this area will be used as a Gateway of the Hadoop platform, a destination of the
    Manual-Files (mostly DHOs and sometimes DMPs), and a Landing-Area of the data
    coming from less secured sources (mostly DGMs). 2. The second layer is a Raw Zone:
    where the data will land directly from the source into the Hadoop platform. The
    data will be directed on specific directories (based on the physical data model),
    and the Metadata will be assigned to it in hive metastore to be affected by an
    external table. In this area, considering the storage space and the computation
    performance, while importing DMPs mainly from RDBMS using Sqoop jobs, the compression
    algorithms can be employed to write the inputs using bzip2 as recommended. In
    this raw zone, to maintain the security of the user privileges and prevent conflicts
    between the MapReduce jobs that might lock the tables, only the data engineers
    (and the data owner) can access this layer. 3. The third layer is a Structured
    Layer: where the raw data will be stored based on a structure and specific data
    types, unlike the raw zone where all the data will be stored as character data
    type. In this layer, technical controls and farming business rules verifications
    will be launched to check the data quality, detect the anomalies on the data and
    inform the data steward (through emails and dashboards) as described on the activity
    diagram of Fig. 5. Also, the historical data will be stored based on the data
    vault model. Only the data engineers, data stewards (and the data owner) should
    have access to this layer. Download : Download high-res image (194KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Activity Diagram for Data Quality Checks. 4.
    The fourth layer is a Trusted Zone: where the data will be stored based on a data
    model (e.g., Star Schema, Snowflake, or Fact-Constellation) after checking the
    Data Quality and cleaning it on the previous “Structured-Layer.” This zone is
    recommended as the “source of truth” and the centralized Hadoop data warehouse
    of the Smart-Farm, which will be the single source to all Smart Farming-Analytics
    KPIs. 5. The fifth layer is an Enrichment Layer: where the data will be transformed
    and enriched with KPIs calculations for a specific analytics/analysis perspective.
    After the ingestion success on this zone, from a NameNode & memory performance
    management perspective, a job should be launched to delete the related raw zone
    files (to decrease the number of Metadata that have to be handled). The data in
    this layer should be stored in a format readable by data scientists, data analysts
    and suitable for data visualization analysis. Mostly star schemas and snowflakes
    logical data models will be used to store the data in the form of domain-specific
    data marts. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Smart Farming Oriented Big Data Architecture. The SFOBA architecture
    also has two vertical layers: 1. Batch-Layer: where Batch and Micro-Batch data
    will be processed (using technologies like Apache Spark and Python, Apache Kylin),
    stored (on HDFS, Hive, and Impala), and automated in the form of a directed acyclic
    graph workflow (using Oozie or Airflow). 2. Real-Time: where streaming data will
    be consumed (using Kafka or Flume), processed & transformed (using SparkStreaming),
    and then stored directly on the enrichment layer (using HBase) to be joined with
    the batch data, this process will be automated within a data pipeline (using NiFi
    or Streamsets) [33]. Data science for smart farming Data science is a process
    of studying large quantities of disparate data and extracting insights and knowledge
    to aid organizations in making tactics and strategic timely-right decisions. This
    process involves statistical analysis, mathematics, machine-learning, data-visualization,
    etc. Farmers have always been collecting (manually or automatically) a huge amount
    of data for each agriculture season, e.g., applied inputs, harvested crops, planted
    deeds, etc. The growth of new digital technologies (satellites, IoT, remote sensors,
    and drones) has led to the rise of Digital-Farming, which supplies farmers with
    a massive amount of data regarding temperature, nitrogen, soil conditions, etc.
    Data science can help farmers personalize their decisions regarding each farming
    process, using AI tools to speed up analyzing data and bringing back valuable
    insights to farmers. Data science is a generic term that includes the complete
    data processing methodology, where AI encompasses each tool that enables computers
    to learn problem-solving and decision-making. Machine-Learning is a subset of
    AI that makes accurate decisions, uses algorithms to analyze the data, and learns
    from this process without explicitly programming it. Machine Learning models use
    large datasets for training and learn as things progress from these examples,
    but not from a defined-rules (unlike the rules-based algorithms). Thus, they can
    be used for predictive analysis, fraud detection, market basket analysis, recommendations,
    etc. To define a decision rule from which the strategic decisions will be conducted
    [34]. In this research, we have compared machine learning algorithms to find the
    most suitable ones for the smart farming analytics in terms of forecasting and
    predictions. This section determines how we implied machine learning for predicting
    the drought status, crop distribution, and machines breakdown. SFOBA made the
    process of ingesting and transforming the data flexible, easy, and maintainable.
    The first step is the data collected from different sources as defined in Table
    1. The manual source containing the crops-statistics will land on the NFS (let''s
    call it the Edge Node), and a structure check will be done on the Excel-File (using
    Spark or Python). The data will be pushed into the Raw-Zone. For the website data
    sources (accessed via REST API / Web scraping), from a security perspective, it
    is recommended that this data lands first on the Edge Node, and then it will be
    pushed into the Raw-Zone. The RDBMS data (e.g., Oracle database) can be ingested
    directly into the Raw Zone external tables. Table 1. Data Collection from the
    sources. Data Source Domain Data Extraction Tool Technique Governmental Web site

    on the date Oracle Database Drought Status Sqoop Batch loading: a one-time load
    yearly that overwrites the target table Excel File Crop Statistics Spark / Python
    Batch loading: ingesting the whole file In the second step, the data will follow
    the data-ingestion and data-quality process-workflow from the Raw-Zone to the
    Enrichment-Layer, following the defined data models to rich the data mart dedicated
    to the spatial distribution. At this point, we can build our datasets/views dedicated
    to the predictions of drought status and crop distribution. For the soil profile
    classification, it is recommended to use Naïve-Bayes [35]. Either K-means clustering
    using Euclidian-distance or data-binning can be used to label the rainfall, pressure,
    and temperature data since the cluster members are not the same and can be grouped
    obviously. It is a lot easier (in terms of time and performance) to define the
    binning rules that will separate the rows in the data, label the rainfall from
    one to ten, the pressure from one to six, and the temperature from one to ten
    one to five. Otherwise, K-means can be more suitable to sense the length of the
    data since we already know the number of clusters in the data. Given a set of
    points ). We try to partition the points into k sets by minimizing the distance
    between the points to inside each partition. After that, the most important part
    is building the models. For smart-farming analytics, it is recommended not to
    split data randomly into training and test datasets. After building the required
    datasets, it is now time to build the models (the algorithms are described below)
    using technologies like Spark MLlib (it is highly recommended for huge building
    huge data models with massive data) and Python libraries like sklearn. The training
    data containing the three primary parameters Rainfall, Pressure, and Temperature
    to create the model (a first classifier) will build trends and correlations that
    can be used to classify the Drought-Status from low, medium to high and estimate
    the required Rainfall and Pressure. Then a second classifier should be built,
    considering the Season aspect (correlating the data for seasonal parameters).
    This model has as input: (1)- the result of the first classifier; (2)- Crop type
    and soil statistics correlated; (3)- Season data and fertilizers statistics correlated.
    Random Forest (RF) is a nonparametric regression/classification is aimed at retaining
    most of the Decision-Trees'' strengths and get rid of their drawbacks, like their
    vulnerability to over-learning and the complexity of pruning operations. We choose
    the last one from the three main classifiers boosting, bagging, and RF. When it
    comes to boosting, it uses repeated (iterative) retraining. The weights of the
    samples classified incorrectly will be increased as the iterations progress to
    form them more importantly for the successive iterations. Boosting is considered
    a better classifier (more accurate) than bagging, but it is too slow because it
    is noise-sensitive and might fall in overtraining [36], [37], [38], [39], [40].
    On the other hand, the RF classifier can be considered as an advanced version
    of bagging. Fig. 6 shows the results of the confusion matrix obtained from both
    RF classifiers. The algorithm of Random-Forest is founded on three principal ideas,
    which makes it more accurate than other classifiers: 1- From an initial sample
    of N observations where each one is described using p predictive variables, a
    B new samples with the same size of N will be artificially created by the drawing
    with the replacement. This is called the Bootstrap technique, where the B samples
    allow for training B different Decision-Trees. 2- Only a chosen number (at random)
    will be used to perform the associated segmentation with the node of a tree from
    the p Predictive-Variables. 3- While classifying a new observation ×, it will
    be passed through the B trees, and then the majority class among the B predictions
    will be selected. It is based on the fact that the algorithm groups “weak” algorithms
    so that the B decision trees will form a more robust algorithm by voting and by
    proceeding. Download : Download high-res image (75KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. RF Confusion Matrix for Classifier I and II. ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser
    3), this algorithm repeatedly divides features into numerous groups (at least
    two) at each step. To build the Decision Tree, the ID3 uses a greedy top-down
    approach, starting from the top to build three, and at every iteration, the best
    feature at the current moment will be selected for node creation. It is based
    on information gain to calculate in the Entropy the reduction to measure how the
    obtained feature classifies (separates) the target classes. The selected attribute
    is the one with the highest information gain. It is important to note that the
    training data can be over-fitted. Thus, it is recommended to use smaller Decision-Trees.
    The ID3 usually constructs small trees (but not usually the smallest possible),
    since in Smart-Farming and especially for the spatial distribution, the data will
    be refreshed mainly based on agriculture-seasons, which fits better the ID3, which
    doesn''t perform better with continuous data [37]. Fig. 7 shows the results of
    the Confusion-Matrix obtained from both ID3 classifiers. Download : Download high-res

    for Classifier I and II. Predictive maintenance in smart farming As we described
    in the previous sections, a timely right preventive action can avert the farm
    from a huge loss, especially when it comes to the equipment break down. In possession
    of the fact table of the mechanical system maintenance, we can look up the measurement
    trends and regroup them into two categories: the ones related to broke-down equipment
    and the ones not, as follows: if EQUIPMENT_ID exist in Order_Intervention, then
    STATUS = broken-down else STATUS = normal. For this perspective, a full join between
    Measurement-Trends and Order_Intervention will be used to create Boolean variable.
    The records that exist on Measurement-Trends and don’t exist in Order_Interventions
    are the ones with the status normal, so this value will be assigned to the Boolean
    variable. Otherwise, it is broken down. This variable will be the target variable
    of the logistic regression model, a linear classification counterpart of the linear
    regression where the target variable “y” takes two values 0 or 1 (Normal or Broken-down).
    As it is a linear model, a score function S of the predictor variables is used
    as follows: (1) For the selection of variables, in the first place, there is the
    Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The AIC was used by proceeding with the backward
    manner, which starts from the model with all the variables, removing at each step
    a single variable until the models indicate that it is better not to remove any
    more variables. The most explicative variable is the one that has the closest
    critical-Probability to zero. As a result, we found that the most explicative
    variables are measurement and category. Also, generally, in the context of a logistic
    model, we do not present the model coefficients but their exponential value. The
    latter corresponds to odds ratios, which differ from the relative risk, but his
    interpretation is similar. An odds ratio of 1 mean no effect. On the other hand,
    an odds ratio much greater than one corresponds to an increase in the phenomenon
    studied. An odds ratio much less than one corresponds to a decrease in the phenomenon
    studied. Decision trees are highly flexible, supervised, non-parametric ML models.
    They can be used both for classification and regression. They use purely algorithmic
    methods which are not based on any probabilistic model. The basic idea is to classify
    an observation using a series of questions (or segmentation criteria) concerning
    the values of the predictor variables xi of this observation. A node in a decision
    tree represents each question. Each outgoing branch of the node corresponds to
    a possible answer to the question asked. Conclusion The future smart agriculture
    will be based on advanced data acquisition combined with several technologies.
    All these outlooks involve data management in a certain way. With the development
    of open-source and big data, different techniques emerged to remedy the limitations
    of traditional decision-making systems. Given the fact, and as we described in
    this research, a Smart-Data-Management can provide a weave of solutions to facilitate
    the farmers'' work when dealing with their daily processes. Therefore, we proposed
    a smart farming-oriented Big Data Architecture (SFOBA) that provides a platform
    to manage farming data in different layers, which executes tasks accordingly,
    allowing for more flexibility and agility. In this paper, we have proposed some
    of the main technical constraints, a Data-Quality process, a way to model the
    farm''s data based on the business logic, a comparison between Machine-Learning
    algorithms where the ID3 gave the highest level of accuracy. In the future, build
    an abstraction layer on top of the SFOBA that automatically handles them based
    on rules defined on the system, without adding them as actions on the directed-acyclic
    graph of the ingestion workflows. The project management aspect, DataOps methodology,
    and the Agile method give an enterprise tincture to the Smart-Farm Data-Management.
    The ultimate goal of our research is to ensure agricultural sustainability and
    environmental protection, secure the energy-consumption, and reach a reasonable
    level of quality, productivity, and high efficiency. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: The integration of agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain
    has become the key technology of precision agriculture. How to protect data privacy
    and security from data source is one of the difficult issues in agricultural IoT
    research. This work integrates cryptography, blockchain and Interplanetary File
    System(IPFS) technologies, and proposes a general IoT blockchain terminal system
    architecture, which strongly supports the integration of the IoT and blockchain
    technology. This research innovatively designed a fine-grained and flexible terminal
    data access control scheme based on the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption(CP-ABE)
    algorithm. Based on CP-ABE and DES algorithms, a hybrid data encryption scheme
    is designed to realize 1-to-N encrypted data sharing. A "horizontal + vertical"
    IoT data segmentation scheme under blockchain technology is proposed to realize
    the classified release of different types of data on the blockchain. The experimental
    results show that the design scheme can ensure data access control security, privacy
    data confidentiality, and data high-availability security. This solution significantly
    reduces the complexity of key management, can realize efficient sharing of encrypted
    data, flexibly set access control strategies, and has the ability to store large
    data files in the agricultural IoT.

    NY, USA SECTION I. Introduction This Precision farming in general is way of practicing
    farming based on observing, measuring and responding to intra field variability
    using crop management [1]. This feature allows farmers to make important decision
    related to effective utilization of resources in real scenario. It is an approach
    where precise small amounts of inputs are utilized in order to produce high yield
    [2]. It makes use of recent technology that uses hub of various technologies like
    information technology, satellite technology, remote sensing and geographical
    information system that are used for increasing the functionality and services
    required in the agriculture sector [3]. Precision agriculture make use of unmanned
    vehicles, cloud computing, block chain, internet of things, different sensors
    etc. Different sensors like soil, humidity, temperature, rainfall, plant disease
    etc. are used for collecting data which is processed in real scenario [4]. With
    the help of advanced technology used in agriculture, precision agriculture will
    add to the economic growth of the economy. As the world’s population is increasing
    at its peak, farmers need to produce more food products both in quality as well
    as quantity [5]. To adapt the ever-increasing demand, large farms are adopting
    precision farming to increase field yield, reduce waste management, and to mitigate
    economic and security risks prevailing in the fields [6]. Traditional methods
    take into consideration decision related to planting, harvesting, use of pesticides
    and fertilizers in order to increase the yielding of food grains but these results
    in slow processing when the demand is very high [7]. This made shift towards precision
    farming with the use of information and communication tools (ICT). This advanced
    technology makes use of different sensors, unnamed vehicles, mapping tools and
    block chain technology. Robot mounted sensors and drones equipped with camera
    captures plant images having information related to size of plant, leaf shape,
    moisture and soil content around the plant which uses different algorithm for
    finding healthy plant status [8]. This feature helps farmer to monitor their affected
    areas in the field and to when provide solution related to spraying of fertilizers
    on infected plants by providing feedback to farmers in real time. Some of the
    advantages of precision farming includes increase agriculture productivity, prevention
    of soil degradation, practice of modern techniques to improve quality, quantity
    and reduce cost of production, changes socio-economic status of farmers, improved
    time management, reduced use of water and chemical spraying, healthier food crops
    and higher yielding variety of seeds resulting in conserving the water resources
    and reducing chemical runoff [9]. Precision farming enables climate based smart
    agriculture business via wide range resulting in adopting new techniques in developing
    areas with simple, affordable and effective mix of technologies and practices.
    With the use of precision farming, crop production is done in eco-friendly manner
    along with having site specific knowledge one can target fertilizers rate, seeds
    and chemicals required for crop production [11]. The main purpose to use precision
    farming is to inculcate long term sustainability by reducing the environmental
    load by only using fertilizers and pesticides when they are required. Other key
    benefit to the environment results in reduction of losses from excess applications,
    nutrient imbalances, leaf damage from insects etc. Table 1 shows findings of different
    research articles on Precision farming. TABLE I. findings of different research
    articles on Precision farming. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 discusses about related work; Section 3 describe Blockchain Technology
    including features, integration between IoT and blockchain model; Section 4 explain
    about IoT Network Challenges and Blockchain Preventive Measures in Precision Farming
    followed by Conclusion in Section 5. SECTION II. Literature Review Blockchain
    technology allows transparent transaction to take place between peer groups without
    involving any third party in the agricultural sector. As there is no involvement
    of third party, trust is measured using cryptography and peer architectural model.
    This helps in reducing the transaction costs in agro based markets and builds
    a strong bond between producers and consumers. As number of security measures
    are involved in the process, this technology helps in tracing transactions between
    unidentified users. With involvement of real time functioning, redundancy and
    malfunctioning can be easily addressed. Government sector paves its way by providing
    different solutions for enriching the standard and security of food products.
    Transparent facilitation amongst all the involved parties results in collection
    of reliable data. In order to make farming smart and less prone to vulnerabilities,
    data collected by the sensors adds valuable asset for developing data driving
    facilities [17]. Block chain is considered as materialize technology for smart
    farming, supply chain offers a digital database for monitoring, keeping track
    records, processing digital and physical resources. Greater traceability and inflated
    standard transactions are offered using block chain technology. This technology
    works with real time integration and managing of agricultural supply chain. All
    the services such as providing fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation facilities
    are incorporated by supply chain users in an assigned manner with all product
    specific attribute information. It stores undeviating records that are easily
    accessible to all users in transparent manner. The authenticity of agricultural
    products can be monitored using traceability forum in agriculture supply chain.
    It offers liability for violation on products authenticity by making regular updates
    [18]. Water is the most basic necessity of human being. In agriculture sector
    also water is considered as life nourishment for plants. Earlier farmers were
    totally dependent on rainfall for watering crops. But as the need for producing
    more and more grains increases, this made move towards adopting contemporary farming
    methods with the use of ICT. A model was designed using IoT integrated with mobile
    gadgets. Temperature and moisture sensors are used for collecting data which was
    combined with Raspberry-Pi for turning water pump on and off as per the requirement.
    Another model was introduced which waters the field on the basis of weather forecasting.
    For weather forecasting different APIs are used for watering the schedule for
    plants by considering previous and current trend [19]. The most revolutionary
    technology considered in this era is IoT. It works on the concept of interacting
    between various physical devices using specific addressing modes. It elongates
    it’s path in almost all sectors including industry, transportation, healthcare,
    smart city, agriculture etc. IoT devices provide wide range of information of
    physical parameters to enhance the cultivation practices. As most of the applications
    are based on wireless technology, role and use of these technologies become the
    top most priority. Smart sensors, unmanned vehicles, low power wide area network
    (LPWAN), Long range Wide Area Access Networks (LoRaWAN) are included in smart
    farming communication techniques [20]. Precision agriculture sector uses unmanned
    aerial vehicles or sensing purpose or providing communication specific platforms
    [21]. For environment monitoring, spatial and temporal resolution, image acquisition,
    aerial vehicles are used. Unmanned vehicles are used for capturing crop images,
    spraying pesticides, weed management and providing irrigation facilities in smart
    farming. It also supports decision support system on farms and provide assistance
    to the cultivators. Table 2 shows the over view of different research carried
    out in precision farming with the use of Blockchain Technology. TABLE II: Overview
    of Different Research carried out in Precision Farming with the use of Blockchain
    Technology. SECTION III. Blockchain Technology: Overview Blockchain also referred
    as distributed ledger technology. With the use of decentralization and cryptographic
    hashing makes digital asset unalterable and transparent. In simple terminology
    a block chain technology can be understood as considering google document as an
    example. A google document is created and shared with a group of people where
    it is being shared rather than copied. This enables decentralization of network
    chains which gives access to everyone to read or write the document at same time
    [30]. All the changes are being made transparent and recorded in real scenario.
    Blockchain comprises of three main components: blocks, nodes and miners. Figure
    1 shows diagrammatic representation of different block chain components. Fig.
    1. Different Components of Blockchain Show All (i) Blocks Every chain comprises
    of multiple blocks and each block uses three main elements. Data present inside
    the block. 32-bit number called nonce. It is randomly generated when the block
    is designed which give rise to block header hash [31]. Hash is 256-bit number
    which starts with zeroes. When the starting block of chain is created, cryptographic
    hash is generated by the nonce. Data is signed in the block and tied to the nonce.
    (ii) Nodes Decentralization is one of the most important features in block chain
    technology. Chain is formed with the help of connected nodes. In order to keep
    the network functioning, nodes act as electronic device maintaining the copies
    of block chain. Every node manages its own copy which is to be verified by the
    network and approve newly mined block for chain to be trusted and verified [32].
    Transparency of blockchain makes ledger to easily verify any action. A unique
    identification number is provided for each transaction to be carried out. In order
    to maintain the trust and integrity among users, public information is combined
    with system checks. (iii) Miners With the process of mining, new blocks on the
    chain are created. Mining is a bit difficult task when the chain is long enough
    as each block has unique hash referencing to the previous block in the chain [33].
    If any change is required in the block, re-mining of the current block along with
    blocks succeeding it needs to get changed which makes it difficult to make changes
    in the blockchain technology [34]. On successful mining of a block, change is
    acceptable by all nodes in the network. A. Features Of Blockchain Block chain
    technology comprises of following features as depicted by Figure 2. Fig. 2. Features
    of Block chain Technology Show All (i) Persistency If any transaction is being
    added or started by the block chain, it becomes very difficult to remove that
    block from the processed transaction [35]. While for all the invalid transactions,
    there is possibility of discovering them before being used. (ii) Auditability
    For ease of verification and tracking of transactions, this property helps in
    securely linking each block to previous block. (iii) Decentralization This property
    refers to transferring the control and decision making from organization to any
    distributed network. For any transactions to be processed are carried out by distributed
    ledger-based point to point network. Decentralized network reduces the level of
    trust that participants place with one another and control the ways that debase
    the serviceability of network. (iv) Anonymity A unique identity code is generated
    each time participant communicate with the blockchain, without depicting the specifications
    of the user. This gives an insight to many research problems in terms of security
    which is to be addressed. B. Integration Model between Blockchain and IoT The
    population of country is at alarming rate and it is very much important to provide
    both quality as well as quantity food products. After the production of food grains,
    it becomes important to supply that product to the end users within prescribed
    time period. When the transfer of food grains is to be carried out a number of
    challenging features exist in the system which is to be addressed. Some of the
    common problems associated with transporting agricultural products are communication
    breakage between supplier and retailer, limitation on financing resources, lack
    of transparency between food production and distribution [36]. In order to overcome
    all the drawbacks existing in the system, integration of IoT with Blockchain Technology
    is introduced. IoT peers build a trust-based pattern over blockchain design which
    helps in IoT device communication. Each device can take more than one node in
    the network for its representation [37]. With the help of blockchain protocol
    IoT devices can transfer data in the network topology with the help of set of
    predefined rules. To have secure IoT based transactions, block chain protocol
    is used for management and verification purpose. To have effective monitoring
    and management of integration model, a special framework is required for sensing
    the events and transactions between IoT gadgets [38]. The integration model should
    be capable enough for monitoring transaction patterns. The model comprises of
    following three components: (i) Monitoring Agent During the transaction process,
    different logs are created which are associated with IoT application. Monitoring
    of all the logs is done with the help of an intelligent agent. (ii) Log Collection
    Engine Once the logs are received, the log collection engine make relevant changes
    in the log information by removing unnecessary data from the log and forwarding
    it further for transaction process. (iii) Nodes Cluster This feature groups data
    on the basis of similarity and differences and further maps it with IoT data log
    file. (iv) Visualization Platform Provides a platform for data collection by individual
    cluster nodes for forming effective statistics. C. Secure IoT Communications &
    Performance challenges Classical used protocols like Hyper-text transfer protocol
    and Extensible messaging and presence protocol are restored with much secure protocols
    such as Datagram transport layer security for providing secure communication between
    IoT gadgets. The drawback of these protocols in terms of computational time, memory,
    key generation and central management unit made a shift towards using blockchain
    technology which uses enhance key management between IoT gadgets by providing
    unique id to all the nodes once the network is being installed. Block chain is
    considered one of the best suited security solution for achieving communication
    between IoT devices. To trace the malware, IoT devices are hashed with block chain
    and a message is sent to the device owners so that necessary step and security
    measures can be inbuilt in the system [39]. Another important feature provided
    by blockchain is authentication and verification for having secure communication
    between devices. If sender node wants to send data to the receiving node, it adds
    hashed message with the data where it is verified at the receiving end. If both
    the hashed value matches, then the data is considered as authentic. Large number
    of nodes are deployed in precision agriculture network, IoT system need to process
    large amount of data with increased throughput and dynamic topology change. So
    there is a strong opposition for the performance of IoT network. The three basic
    layers in traditional IoT based model comprises of: (i) Gateway Layer Alternatively
    called perception layer which comprises of different sensors, controllers and
    mobile devices. Messages are sent via gateway with the help of endpoints. Sensors
    are connected with the help of gateway and forward the message. (ii) Platform
    Layer Alternatively called network layer. It defines the best possible network
    route for transferring data. With the help of different protocols, collected information
    by the sensors are routed at different paths. (iii) Application Layer Responsible
    for data exchange between mobile based applications and different platforms suited
    for IoT technology. SECTION IV. IoT Network Challenges and Blockchain Preventive
    Measures in Precision Farming Designing smart IoT based network in precision farming
    is one of the major concern areas where security threats and network performance
    persists in the system. As cyber-crime is most common type of attack where greenhouse
    network and crops required for trading purpose are to be protected. As security
    is the most important factor therefore a trusted network is required for managing
    and accessing the machines. As the system uses involvement of heterogeneous devices,
    sensors, communication speed, bandwidth, latency and power consumption, therefore
    a number of challenges exist in the system [40]. This section of the paper explains
    use of Blockchain Technology to make IoT based communication system more reliable
    and secure. It offers wide range of good solutions related to real scenario data
    monitoring and improving entire transaction processes. In order to have any secure
    system, the main pillars of security- availability, integrity and confidentiality
    must be preserved. Availability states that required information must be made
    available before use. Integrity states that data must not be altered in between
    the entire process. It maintains the accuracy of the data. Confidentiality means
    that the information must be made confidential so that no intruder can access
    the important information. The different security challenges faced by precision
    farming are explained as follows. (i) Interoperability of different standards
    With the use of recent technologies based on Information and communication, interoperability
    is major concern. The different tools and technologies need not follow same set
    of standards in order to have uniformity in the system. The key issue lies in
    transforming standalone gateway to holistic, farmer friendly platforms. (ii) Learning
    Curve Precision farming involves implementation of new technologies for crop production.
    For small farmers setting up of necessary architecture and sensors, is a tough
    task. Technical knowledge is required for setting the concept of smart farming
    in their farms with latest used technologies. (iii) Connectivity in rural areas
    Farmers in the rural areas lack strong and reliable internet connectivity which
    in turn reduces the possibility to apply smart agriculture methods in such areas.
    Until network bandwidth and speed are increased, smart farming is still a problematic
    issue. Data storage services and cloud-based computing also requires to be stronger.
    (iv) Energy depletion risks Switching over to smart agriculture results in many
    environmental advantages. High energy consumption is required for setting large
    data centers and hubs for operating smart sensors and gadgets. For this reason,
    there is a shift towards farming technique that take into consideration minimum
    use of energy resources. (v) Technical failures and resultant damages If there
    is any mechanical breakdown in setting up of hardware, sensor unit it results
    in serious crop damage. Considering an example of irrigation system, if sensors
    are not functioning properly there can be either under watered or over watering
    of crops. (vi) Security Factor The presence of information thefts in any system
    is a peril comprising smart agriculture too. In order to have any secure system,
    the key elements of security- availability, integrity and confidentiality must
    be preserved. Availability states that required information must be made available
    before use. Integrity states that data must not be altered in between the entire
    process. It maintains the accuracy of the data. Confidentiality means that the
    information must be made confidential so that no intruder can access the important
    information. Detecting and removing the malware is a big challenge which is to
    be addressed. For this reason, different security mechanisms are being implemented
    in the system. Figure 3 shows the different security challenges faced by precision
    farming which are explained as follows. Fig. 3. Different security challenges
    faced by precision farming Show All SECTION V. Conclusion The study was carried
    out to investigate significance of Integrating Blockchain with IoT. The findings
    seen after carrying out the integration used in precision farming can be classified
    into following categories. Initial section of the paper gives brief insight about
    block chain technology, overview of its components and features of using this
    technology. With the involvement of IoT with blockchain, many securities related
    problems are resolved in precision farming. Literature review gives an overview
    about different block chain platforms used for managing different sectors in precision
    farming like food supply chain, livestock grazing, and crops overseeing. The second
    phase of the paper gives an outline of integrating block chain model with IoT.
    With the help of this model many reductions are done on excessive use of resources
    which helps in adding sustainability to the environment. The later section of
    the paper deals with challenges in IoT based systems used in precision farming
    along with solutions provided by blockchain technology, different blockchain opportunities
    IoT based precision agriculture. Many loop holes still persist, which need to
    be monitored timely. Further work can be extended by using different use case
    used in precision farming where block chain technology provides different solutions.
    One main issue related to security must be addressed where different security
    mechanisms can be introduced to make the model more reliable and secure. Authors

  description: The ability to conduct useful science under the framework of precision
    agriculture is not only dependent upon the collection of high quality usable data
    of plants, soil, and water, but also dependent upon the type of vehicle the sensors
    are flown on, properly tuned sensors, and the way in which the vehicle is flown.
    To achieve this capability requires the proper matching and integration of air
    vehicle, sensors, mission design, and image processing techniques. Although commercial
    Unmanned Air Systems are starting to be equipped with autopilots, sensors, and
    simple data processing software, they are often limited to only one sensor, and

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Miami, FL, USA SECTION I. Introduction UAS
    have been shown to be useful tools providing high performance and cost-effective
    solutions in a diverse range of areas. Schwartzbach et. Al. [1] successfully implemented
    UAS for sampling water of remote wetland ecosystems. In urban environments, UAS
    were shown to be a cost-effective and flexible platform for traffic monitoring
    by Kanistras et. Al. [2]. Henrickson et. Al. [3] demonstrated capability of using
    a combination of fixed-wing and rotorcrafts to perform infrastructure assessments.
    Other UAS applications have included real-time river flooding assessment [4],
    river mapping for water management [5]–[6] and rangeland surveillance [7]. A growing
    area of interest for UAS application is precision agriculture. Anderson [8] indicated
    the importance of UAS in spatial ecology in 2013. The challenge of providing high
    quality and timely actionable information will only continue to grow in importance
    over the coming years, and UAS stand to greatly facilitate the collection of high
    quality imagery data focused on precision agriculture. Rotorcraft have been used
    for precision sensing due to the capability to hover. Primicerio et. Al. proposed
    a six-rotor UAS capable of flying autonomously with a multi-spectral camera [9].
    Candón showed that UAS has the ability to monitor crops at a small scale. Rotorcraft
    UAS are restricted with payload and flight time. Valasek et. Al.[10] used multispectral
    sensors with fixed-wing UAS to image corn and cotton providing large coverage
    as well as high resolution. The Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES)
    and Texas A&M AgriLife Research jointly supported a two year internal effort that
    focused on developing and demonstrating precision agriculture capabilities for
    the science mission using both fixed-wing and rotorcraft-based platforms. The
    goal was to develop an expandable system that is capable of providing a modular
    platform for multi-sensor integration. The Texas A&M Vehicle Systems and Control
    Laboratory (VSCL) was the lead organization in this effort, with a specific objective
    of investigating the suitability of fixed-wing UAS for precision agriculture.
    The traditional paradigm for most science applications of UAS such as precision
    agriculture has been that good science is a function of using good sensors + data
    reduction. This paradigm is not correct because there is currently a gap between
    Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) UAS and research purposed unmanned vehicles that
    can carry and properly fly high performance sensors. For customizable sensor integration,
    Commercial UAS are starting to be equipped with autopilots, sensors, and simple
    data processing software, but are often limited to carrying only one sensor. Additionally,
    there is often a lack of cross platform integration expandability. This gap negatively
    impacts the science mission. This paper seeks to address this gap by proposing
    a new paradigm for good science and validating it with results from precision
    agriculture. This new paradigm is that good science is a function of the UAS vehicle
    + good sensors + properly integrated and tuned sensors + how the UAS is flown
    + data reduction. Each of these factors may seem obvious and perhaps redundant
    but in fact each of them has a significant effect on the quality of imagery collected,
    and ignoring or not properly addressing any of them any of them is shown to be
    problematic. The work and results addressed in this paper seek to develop methodologies
    and procedures for fixed-wing precision agriculture, including sensor selection,
    vehicle platform selection, flight operations and permissions, data collection
    flights in real-world precision agriculture scenarios, and assessment of collected
    imagery and data. The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the
    sensor selection, vehicle platform selection, vehicle modification, avionics,
    as well as providing justification for these selections in the context of precision
    agriculture applications. Section III details the developed flight planning procedures
    for operating these systems for precision agriculture purposes. Section IV provides
    detailed post flight sensor specific data processing procedure. Sections V and
    VI provide some concluding thoughts and describe extensions of this work. SECTION
    II. Flight Hardware A. Sensors Two primary sensors were selected for testing and
    demonstration purposes. The first is a ICI 8640 P-series UAV calibrated thermal
    camera with temperature measurement. The sensor uses a Banana Pi as the control
    and storage module and provides CAN bus input for GPS triggering. The sensor system
    draws 3 Wand weighs around 0.55 lbs, with dimensions of 1.8×1.53×1.49 inches.
    When set to pixel-resolution of 640×512 , the frame rate for the sensor is approximately
    30 Hz and provides accuracy of ± 1 ∘ C . The second sensor is a Sentek GEMS Multispectral
    Sensor (Figure 2), a light-weight stand-alone unit with dual 1.3-megapixel (MP)
    CMOS sensors for visual (RGB) and near infrared (NIR) imagery collection that
    costs approximately $1500. The unit weighs 0.57 lbs, has dimensions of 3.5×5.0×2.0
    inches, and has a built in inertial navigation system (INS) and GPS antenna. When
    set to 1.3-MP images, the Sentek sensor is capable of recording an image (both
    RGB and NIR) once every 1.4 seconds. The decision to include a multispectral sensor
    in this project was driven by interest in scenarios in assessing soil and vegetation.
    This particular multispectral sensor was selected based on extensive prior experience
    in using it for imaging crop fields. The Sentek sensor, in comparison with other
    tested multispectral sensors, proved to be the most reliable and user-friendly,
    and achieved the most consistently high quality imagery data. Fig. 1: ICI 8640P-series
    with control module Show All Fig. 2: Sentek GEMS multispectral sensor (with and
    without outer case) Show All B. Fixed-Wing UAS Systems The small UAS is the ReadyMadeRC
    Anaconda shown in Figure 4 has an empty weight of 5.3 pounds, a wingspan of 6.8
    feet, and can carry a payload of 4 pounds for 45–60 minutes. The airframe was
    designed to only fly for roughly 15 minutes, so modifications had to be made to
    the power system in order to achieve the greater endurance. In order to achieve
    this, two 14.8v 5000 mAh lithium polymer battery (LiPo) packs were mounted in
    the nose in parallel to achieve 10,000 mAh of power. This larger amount of power
    allows the Fig. 3: Payload mounting system Show All Anaconda to gain the long
    endurance needed to perform large data collecting missions. In theory, adding
    larger batteries can increase the flight time. However, due to the fuselage design
    of the Anaconda, free payload space exists within the nose to the trailing edge
    of the wing, batteries with more capacity shifts the Center of Gravity (CG) to
    forward CG, resulting a nose heavy flight and reduction of performance. Originally
    intended for first-person view (FPV) hobbyists, an Anaconda airframe costs roughly
    $400 and is designed to easily accommodate sensors in its fuselage. Out of the
    box, the airframe includes mounting brackets for installing a GoPro camera in
    either a fixed position looking forward, or on a gimbal mount hanging underneath
    nose. The Anaconda airframe was selected primarily for its low-cost, its durable
    foam construction, and its relatively large and easily retrofitted to be able
    to accept almost any sensor. The Sentek sensor was placed around the CG point
    to ensure aircraft stability. Major airframe modifications were also needed to
    mount the sensor in the correct position and enable quick payload adjustments
    in the field. A center section of foam was removed from the underside of the fuselage,
    and a 3D-printed multi-hole mounting structure was installed as in Figure 3. The
    mounting system is a light-weight and sturdy system that enables the capability
    of switching the sensors easily while maintaining structural integrity and ensuring
    both the Sentek and ICI cameras have a clear view of the ground at all times.
    The sensors were mounted using foam tape and zip-ties to minimize vibrations and
    sensor shift. Extra mounting plates were added in the fuselage to mount the autopilot
    system and increase the structural rigidity of the fuselage. Once the sensors
    were installed, the Anaconda was flown to assure that aircraft maintained its
    original flying qualities. Anaconda was the UAS of choice for VSCL precision agriculture
    research data collection for the past two years, in which over 133 flights were
    conducted for data collection over the course of 12 months. Fig. 4: VSCL anaconda
    fleet Show All Fig. 5: Pixhawk flight computer Show All C. Avionics The flight
    controller used for the Anaconda mission flights is the Pixhawk flight controller
    [11] The system runs an open-source ArduPlane firmware on a 32-bit STM32f427 Cortex
    M4 with a processing speed of 186MHz. The system along with the digital airspeed
    sensor shown in Figure 6 measures important state information such as airspeed,
    roll, pitch, yaw angles, and logs flight control commands and flight system status
    that can be useful for post-flight analysis. SECTION III. Flight Planning Flight
    planning is an inherent process for data acquisition UAS flights for precision
    agriculture purposes. Seasonal prevailing wind direction and wind intensity, sensor
    specific distance between passes, image over-lap, image side-lap, ground control
    point location, and auto-triggering cycle time are all crucial for quality data
    collection. The ultimate goal of IR/NIR flight path design is to improve mosaic
    quality under a restricted time frame. Flight time is restricted due to the inherit
    nature of large fluctuations with infrared signals. Image quality can be increased
    by reducing flight speed induced motion blur, reducing cross wind paths, and increasing
    image overlap and sidelap. In the following subsections the key factors of a successful
    flight planning is discussed. Fig. 6: Digital pitot tube Show All Fig. 7: Prevailing
    wind direction from july-october at brazos bottoms farm. Show All A. Prevailing
    Wind Prevailing wind intensity is crucial for both the reduction of cross wind
    flight paths and the necessary speeds for take-off and landing. Cross wind during
    flight reduces the accuracy of the waypoint tracking and increases the vehicle
    bank angle, and as a result, increases the complexity of image mosaicing. Due
    to the nature of UAS image acquisition flight environment, the vehicle usually
    carries payloads close to the maximum take-off capacity on unpaved dirt roads
    with limited take-off/landing space. Therefore, by carefully utilizing the seasonal
    prevailing wind, both the percentage of cross wind flight paths and take-off/landing
    distance can be minimized. The direction and intensity of prevailing wind during
    the past three years from July to October at Brazos Bottoms Farm is shown in Figure
    7. Wind speed from 0 to 40 miles/hr are shown in different shaded colors. Prevailing
    wind during the July-October period is the south south east(SSE) direction 150deg±20
    deg with the highest probability of wind speeds 10≤ W s ≤15 miles/hour. It is
    essential to avoid flight path planning with frequent cross wind flight paths.
    B. Waypoint Scheduling Conventional waypoint designs for UAS rotorcrafts is shown
    in subfigure (a) and subfigure (b) in Figure 8. Common issues with the standard
    and cross-stitch waypoint scheduling methods are that the high banking angles
    required for agile turns are not easily achieved with fixed-wing UAS. Additionally,
    agile maneuvers for fixed-wing UAS often results in missed ground control points
    as well as images with high banking angles, which leads to imagery with bad mosaic
    results. From multiple imagery flight test experience, a moving box waypoint design
    method was developed. An example of the moving box method is shown in Figure 9.
    The advantage of this method is that it can reduce the commanded banking angle
    and does not require large control surface maneuvers. Note that Figure 8 and Figure
    9 are examples generated in Mission Planner especially for the purpose of displaying
    waypoint scheduling concept. Using the moving box method, the waypoints are scheduled
    in rectangular box shaped patterns while gradually moving along one direction.
    The pattern can be scheduled either clockwise or counter-clockwise according to
    the wind direction and is specific mission dependent. Issues with the moving box
    method lay on the imagery coverage of the center region. Figure 10 shows a mosaiced
    result from a flight conducted on May 21st, 2016 at the Texas A&M farm, using
    moving box method with low and missed center coverage. This was a result of a
    deviation from preset course due to strong wind with changing directions and a
    lack of defined way points along each lap. To overcome this issue, modifications
    were implemented on the flight planning including adding extra waypoints resurveying
    the center region and increasing overlapping in areas vulnerable to low coverage.
    The updated results will be discussed in Section V. Ground control points (GCP)
    are important for image mosaicking and geo-referencing. Pix4Dmapper (Pix4D SA,
    Lausanne, Switzerland) was used to mosaic images in this study. Geo-tagged images
    along with the GCPs are imported into Pix4D. Pix4D was selected because it is
    one of the most popular and mature UAS image mosaicking software for agricultural
    applications on the market. To create high quality mosaics with less distortion,
    it is recommended to have at least 75 % of forward-overlap between successive
    images and 60 % sidelap between flying tracks. This is sufficient for flights
    with low wind measurements, however, in flight days that wind gusts are above
    15 mph, when the vehicle is in a turn, the cross winds induce the vehicle to bank
    above the banking threshold that is required for good imaging. It is at these
    situations when the GCPs are important for counteract purposes. While the accuracy
    of mosiacs increases with the number of GCPs, four GCPs are required for mosaic
    corrections. Figure 11 compares the desired imagery area with the result of mosaiced
    image for a flight conducted on October 1st, 2016. As shown in the left subfigure,
    the orange box is the region of interest, the blue box as the flight plan area,
    and the white triangular points are the GCPs. Although the desired imaging area
    is small, larger area was sometimes flown over in order to include the permanently
    installed GCPs nearby to ensure good mosaics. Details about the GCPs used in this
    study can be find in our previous publication [12]. Fig. 8: (A) Conventional flight
    path planning. (b) Cross-stitch flight path planning. Show All Fig. 9: Moving
    box flight path planning. Show All C. Waypoint Auto-Triggering There are several
    COTS autopilot software that provides auto-triggering capability. Mission Planner
    provides triggering according to distance or triggering according to a fixed time
    interval. For fixed-wing imaging flights, the first approach often results in
    an skewed distribution of images throughout a flight path. This is the result
    of either the delay time in the autopilot system adjusting to wind gusts and therefore
    miscalculating the distance traveled or reduction of speed when the vehicle is
    banking. Consequently, the latter method is preferred and executed at VSCL. Figure
    12 is an illustrative example of a mission that utilized fixed time interval auto
    triggering and Table I shows the sensor configurations that are taken into account
    upon waypoint planning. When flying at 122 m (400 ft.) AGL, the field-of- view
    of the Sentek multispectral camera on the ground was 106.19 m (width) and 84.95
    m (height), and was 76.05 m (width) and 57.04 m (height) for the ICI thermal camera.
    The corresponding ground sampling distance was about 8.6 cm for Sentek camera
    and 11.5 cm for ICI camera. Fig. 10: Number of overlapping images for each pixel

    SECTION IV. Data Processing Data processing consists of both post-flight data
    selection and pre-mosaic handling. In order to accommodate the differences in
    different sensors, a package written in MATLAB® for image geo-tagging and filtering
    out images with undesired banking and pitching angles. Flight logs from the Pixhawk
    was also analyzed for the purpose of data processing. Figure 13 shows the roll,
    pitch, and yaw attitude of the vehicle during a mission. It can be seen that the
    vehicle is often at a high roll angle ϕ when it is in turning patterns. In this
    particular case, images with pitch angles larger than θ=± 10 ∘ and banking angle
    ϕ=± 8 ∘ were excluded from further processing. The ICI thermal camera did not
    come with an GPS unit. To eliminate the potential interference between multiple
    GPS units, the GPS stamp at each trigger point from the UAS autopilot was matched
    with the images in the post-flight processing. At each instance of triggering
    during a flight, the onboard flight computer sends a HIGH or LOW PWM signal through
    the CAN bus input port to the sensor control module and logs the UNIX time on
    the micro SD card. The PWM toggle creates a short voltage difference that activates
    a trigger event on the sensor. Non-geo-tagged images are then analyzed using the
    post-flight data processing software package for geotagging purposes. An open-source
    Perl based ExifTool [13] is used to read, write and edit meta information on each
    image. The geo-location information is critical for generating successful mosaics.
    The Sentek multispectral sensor provides both altitude trigger mode and manual
    trigger mode for auto-trigger at a specified time interval. Altitude trigger mode
    utilized the compatible GPS system, starts triggering at a specified interval
    after the prescribed altitude is reached. In this mode it has been shown to be
    less reliable due to the interference of GPS signal and is not preferred in this
    paper albeit its convenience on flight operation. Continuous trigger mode immediately
    starts triggering after activation and is terminated after a human operator finalizes
    the mission, providing a high success rate for image capturing. The sensor automatically
    geo-tags the GPS coordinates along with INS information on each image. However,
    due to the fixed time interval automatic trigger, post flight selection of data
    is required before mosaic. Hard banking angle ϕ and pitching angle θ thresholds
    were imposed on the images taken. SECTION V. Results All the flight tests were
    conducted at Texas A&M AgriLife Research''s Brazos Bottom Farm in Burleson County,
    Texas (headquarters at 30.549635N, 96.436821W). The objective was to apply the
    developed flight procedures to successfully capture quality data for on a single
    vehicle using multiple sensors. Figure 14 shows the actual flight path in Lat-Long
    coordinates with a planned flight path as shown in Figure 12 of the June 24th,
    2016 flight. 303 images were collected through trigger toggles and geo-tagged
    through post flight processing. The blue line indicates the flight path of the
    vehicle, green crosses are the planned waypoint location in the flight plan through
    Mission Planner, and the red plus signs show the actual trigger command GPS location
    in the flight. The geo-tagged images provide high correlation between the initial
    and computed image positions in the xz-plane, within a short process time using
    Pix4D. The system-logged GPS locations were also very close to the actual locations
    computed by Pix4D in the XZ plane (Figure 15) and resulted with faster processing
    in Pix4D. In the left subfigure of Figure 15, the red dots indicate disabled or
    uncalibrated images with the green and blue dots as the computed and initial positions.
    Including initial sensor testing flights, a total of 11 flight days with 27 flights
    were flown between the 2016 June-July period. The geo-tagging function was only
    tested in the last two flights and succeeded in both flights. Figure 16 shows
    where raw images were taken and we can see a uniform triggering along the flight
    path. Figure 17 shows sufficient and uniform overlap between images. The right
    subfigure shows the number of overlapping images computed for each pixel for the
    orthomosaic. Red and yellow areas indicate low overlap for which poor results
    may be generated. Green areas indicate an overlap of over 5 images for every pixel.
    Good quality results will be generated as long as the number of keypoint matches
    is also sufficient for these areas. Fig. 14: Geo-tagged location for the thermal
    images Show All Figure 18 shows the mosaic of the thermal data successfully generated
    from the the geo-tagged data shown in Figure 15. Good path planning and coverage
    as well as the geo-tagging resulted with minimal distortion and artifacts which
    can be observed in this mosaic. The brighter the pixel color, the high the temperature
    of that pixel. The cooler pixels on the edges correspond to dense vegetation between
    fields and water areas. There are obvious temperature variations in the center
    field area. This is an important application in precision agriculture as the temperature
    variation in the field is often correlated with crop stresses, such as water stress,
    disease or pest stress. Stresses can possibly cause reduced stomatal openings
    and evapotranspiration rate which would increase the canopy temperature. This
    thermal mosaic can also be used to give advice for irrigation management. Locations
    shown in the figure with higher temperature are possibly the areas with sparse
    stands or relatively drier than those locations shown with lower temperature.
    The mosaic is complete without any gap and distortion which indicated a successful
    implementation of onboard auto-triggering system. Similar success was achieved
    for multispectral imaging using the Sentek camera. Flight test results have indicated
    a ϕ< 8 ∘ and θ< 10 ∘ as a good rule of thumb for the restrictions for image selection.
    Figure 19 shows the flight path of the October 1st, 2016, 3975 images were taken
    at the interval of 0.7 sec and 2023 images were within the constraint limit. Process
    time in Pix4D was significantly reduced from several days to around an hour using
    the preselected images due to the high correlation between the initial and computed
    image positions, and therefore, no process time was spent on calculating an impossible
    solution. Figure 20 shows the mosaiced imagery. Utilizing the developed pre- flight
    and post flight data processing methods the resulting mosaic provides 100 percent
    coverage of the target field with no images discarded. Note that the bright-and-dark
    strips along the flight path in the mosaics were caused by the rapid-changing
    environmental illumination during that particular test date. For strict spectral
    sensing in agricultural applications, we recommend to conduct flights during solar
    noons in cloud-free days. The post-flight data selection method was implemented
    for only one flight due to the completion of the project. Fig. 15: Results of
    computed tie point positions in pix4d. (a) Top view. (b) Front view of X-Z plane.

    The green line follows the position of the images in time starting from the large
    blue dot. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusions This paper proposed a new paradigm
    for realizing good science in precision agriculture missions Procedures and methodologies
    for achieving this paradigm were developed and demonstrated for the collection
    of high quality sensor data using fixed-wing Unmanned Air Systems. The paper also
    addressed vehicle platform selection, sensor selection and their integration,
    sensor tuning, and carefully designed flight operations. It also addressed the
    design of missions to adhere to flight permissions and restrictions while still
    allowing the collection of quality imagery. The methodology and procedures were
    validated by assessment of collected imagery and data from flights conducted on
    actual plots. Based upon the results presented in the paper, it is concluded that
    the proper matching of vehicle characteristics to sensor characteristics, proper
    flight planning and mission design, and use of auto-triggering of the sensor produces
    better data quality and improved mosaicking in terms of image quality metrics
    and percentage of coverage for mosaics. The approach is judged to be a promising
    candidate for improved data collection for precision agriculture. Fig. 17: Number

  description: This position paper aims to trigger a technical discussion by proposing
    a conceptual architecture for big data streaming integrated with complex event
    processing (BiDCEP). BiDCEP expands the Lambda and Kappa (LK) architectures for
    big data streaming to fit the complex event processing (CEP) and event management
    domains of enterprise IT. BiDCEP links CEP components as defined in previous work
    of Events Collections, Purifications and Enrichments with the big data LK batch
    and speed layers, and wraps the LK service layer with integration interfaces for
    expandable grid of interlinked BiDCEP units. The BiDCEP architecture can enable
    the LK big data quality attributes of scale, availability and latency to be maintained,
    while accounting for CEP enterprise IT requirements of load and content shedding,
    basic and derived enrichment, semantics transformation, and security enforcement.
    As such, open source big data streaming strengths can be employed within the context
    of an enterprisegrade IT with monitored service levels.

  description: 'The commercialization of precision agriculture technologies has led
    to resurgence in field-scale on-farm experimentation by farmers and researchers.
    Although the cost of implementing experiments and collecting data has decreased
    due to innovative use of geospatial technologies, barriers to making the best
    farm management decisions based on field experiments remain. The most recent statistics
    of farmers'' adoption and use of yield monitors are reported. Based on theory
    and experiences from a four-year case study of farmers using yield monitor data,
    this study reports how the most successful farmers and researchers make use of
    precision agriculture in their decision-making process. Topics include designing
    and implementing appropriate field-scale experiments conducive to the landscape
    and chosen treatments, collecting and managing data, qualities desired by farmers
    in a reputable spatial data analyst, and using on-farm trial results in the farm
    management decision-making process. Yield monitor data quality impacts the farm
    management decision. Typical yield monitor data analysis may use data subjected
    to a default correction process of farm level software. Recent advances to farm
    level software include the integration of professional data filtering capabilities.
    Results from both traditional aspatial and spatial analyses of differing levels
    of yield data quality are discussed including: 1) accepting default settings from
    a range of popular standard farm software packages and 2) a conscious removal
    of erroneous points and flow delay adjustments. The decisions that the rational
    farm manager would make for each of these scenarios are presented, addressing
    the question of the economic importance of quality yield data.'

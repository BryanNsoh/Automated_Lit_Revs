    Versions Notes Abstract This paper presents an in-depth contextualized tutorial
    on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), covering the fundamental concepts, assessment
    of routing architectures and protocols, and performance optimization techniques
    via a systematic survey and synthesis of the related literature. The negative
    impacts of climate change and the increasing global population on food security
    and unemployment threats have motivated the adoption of the wireless sensor network
    (WSN)-based Agri-IoT as an indispensable underlying technology in precision agriculture
    and greenhouses to improve food production capacities and quality. However, most
    related Agri-IoT testbed solutions have failed to achieve their performance expectations
    due to the lack of an in-depth and contextualized reference tutorial that provides
    a holistic overview of communication technologies, routing architectures, and
    performance optimization modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although
    IoT applications are founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT)
    varies based on the specific performance and user expectations as well as technological,
    architectural, and deployment requirements. Likewise, the agricultural setting
    is a unique and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not apply,
    hence the need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these
    via the following contributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental
    concepts, technologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2)
    an evaluation of the technical design requirements of a robust, location-independent,
    and affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking fault-tolerance
    techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols,
    and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth case study on how
    to design a self-healing, energy-efficient, affordable, adaptive, stable, autonomous,
    and cluster-based WSN-specific Agri-IoT from a proposed taxonomy of multi-objective
    optimization (MOO) metrics that can guarantee an optimized network performance.
    Furthermore, this tutorial established new taxonomies of faults, architectural
    layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) networks and a three-tier
    objective framework with remedial measures for designing an efficient associated
    supervisory protocol for cluster-based Agri-IoT networks. Keywords: Bluetooth

    multi-objective optimization (MOO); wireless sensor network-based Agricultural
    IoT (WSN-based Agri-IoT) 1. Introduction and Tutorial Contributions Currently,
    agriculture is the world’s largest business, employing over one-third of the economically
    active global population and over 70% of the economically active population in
    Africa [1,2]. The impacts of high population growth rates and climate change-induced
    drought (according to Figure 1) on food security, unemployment threats and reduced
    crop quantity/quality make smart Agricultural Internet-of-Things technology (Agri-IoT)
    via precision farming and greenhouses the most promising remedy. However, the
    existing benchmarking Agri-IoT solutions can only be acquired, deployed, and managed
    by farmers with sufficient financial resources, an electricity grid, Wi-Fi/cellular
    coverage, and technical expertise in IoT, which is generally not the case in Ghana
    and Sub-Saharan Africa. These call for a paradigm shift in farming techniques,
    and the most promising game-changers are precision farming and greenhouses whose
    underlying technology is a robust, affordable, autonomous, and optimized, innovative
    WSN-based Agri-IoT [3] that satisfies the critical design expectations presented
    in Figure 2. Figure 1. Seasonal failure probability-2014 [4] depicting the extent
    of climate change impact on Africa’s farmlands. Figure 2. Generalized design expectations
    of WSN-based Agri-IoT technology. Although few surveys and tutorials have been
    authored on this subject, they present mere classifications of communications
    trends on classical IoT [2,5,6,7,8] without any context-specific technical considerations
    of the critical design expectations in Figure 2. For instance, the authors in
    [2,6,7] examined IoT’s communication infrastructure, platforms, standards, development
    trends, and possible network solutions in agriculture. Similarly, the roles of
    industrial IoT (thus, identification-based IoT (example, RFID [6], WSN [9], QR
    codes [5], barcodes) and communication-based IoT (example, ZigBee [5], Z-wave
    [6], MQTT [5,6], LoRa [10], SigFox [11], BLE [12], Li-Fi [5], Wi-Fi [13], Near-Field
    Communication (NFC) [5], and power line area network) were reviewed in terms of
    current research trends, applications, and main challenges in [5]. Although RFID
    tags and WSNs have similar data acquisition capacities, the authors concluded
    that WSN technology is more energy-efficient and suitable for Agri-IoT than the
    costly RFID technologies [5]. Overall, Agri-IoT technology has not yielded its
    intended paradigm transformation in the agricultural sector due to several technical
    challenges that have not received adequate contextual research considerations
    [14]: The agricultural setting is a unique area where conventional IoT technologies
    do not apply. Existing Agri-IoT solutions are location-restricted because they
    are mostly based on Wi-Fi or cellular communication technologies and electricity
    grids with constrained coverages in Africa. A typical African agricultural setting
    lacks access to reliable electricity and the Internet for cellular/Wi-Fi-based
    technologies, and the intended users (farmers) of Agri-IoT technology are low-income
    earners with limited technological expertise. Common Agri-IoT applications mainly
    utilize architecture-restricted, high-resource-demanding routing techniques (e.g.,
    routing over low-power and lossy networks protocol (RPL)) and communication standards
    (e.g., 4G, 5G, ZigBee, LoRa, Wi-FI, and long-term evolution (LTE)) [15], which
    are difficult to access in typical African farms. Consequently, Agri-IoT users
    in Africa expect a context-relevant solution that is affordable, simple to deploy
    and operate by non-experts, location-unrestricted, supportive of large-scale farm
    management, and based on freely available technologies that do not require licensing.
    Thus, they are unlike popular IoT use cases such as medical, vehicular, and industrial
    IoT, whose designs are mainly affected by critical factors including security,
    stable connectivity, and interference, respectively, Agri-IoT is compelled to
    drive on affordable battery-powered SNs, which make architecture, low-power communication
    technology, power optimization, cost, fault tolerance, multihop routing, scalability,
    and environmental impact critical design factors in order to address its resource
    or deployment-induced challenges [12,16,17]. High susceptibility to faults and
    failures: Agri-IoT networks are vulnerable to faults and failures since the resource-constrained
    SNs are densely deployed in hostile environments to autonomously operate via a
    network supervisory protocol with limited post-deployment maintenance services.
    This supervisory protocol must incorporate sufficient power optimization, auto-fault
    management (FM), and self-adaptability techniques in order to achieve the desired
    performance expectation. Due to the lack of an in-depth and context-relevant tutorial
    that bridges the gap between theoretical taxonomies and real-world designs, most
    canon Agri-IoT testbed solutions, such as those authored in [1,10,11,17,18,19,20],
    suffered abrupt failures during outdoor deployments. Agri-IoT technology lacks
    comprehensive context-based synthesis from SN design to field deployment. The
    power- and resource-constrained SNs that form the WSN-based Agri-IoT network in
    the aforementioned context require limited data transmission rates, computational
    capabilities, memory capacities, communication distance, and operational stability.
    Consequently, the associated routing protocol [9,12,17,21], communication technology,
    and routing architecture [22,23,24] must support mechanisms that ensure packet
    size and communication distance moderation [16], efficient channel access management
    (CAM), and SN’s tasks management. It is not a mere application of conventional
    IoT to a farm, as many authors attempted [1,10,11,12,17,18,19,20,23,25,26], which
    lacked application-specific requirements such as dense network inter-connectivity,
    higher information perceptibility, comprehensive intelligence services, remote
    monitoring, smart decision making, and the execution of precise control/actuation
    actions on the farm. Superficial consideration of desired communication technologies
    of Agri-IoT without considering the cluster-based architecture: To date, Agri-IoT-related
    surveys and tutorials focused on high-power-demanding communication technologies
    (Wi-Fi and cellular-based technologies), the centralized architecture-constrained
    ZigBee standard, and the operation principles of conventional IoT as authored
    in [1,10,11,14,18,19] without an in-depth consideration of the unique case of
    Agri-IoT. It is well established that the cluster-based architecture is the best
    candidate for Agri-IoT application [12,16,17,24]; however, there are no systematic
    evaluations to cement this fact. For instance, most benchmarking WSN-based IoT
    testbed solutions are founded on the ZigBee IEEE 802.15.4 communication standard
    and high-resource-demanding Wi-Fi, cellular-based, and 6LoWPAN/IPv6 routing standards.
    These standards also thrive on wired or fixed IP-based infrastructural backbones,
    total Internet/electricity coverage, and highly complex graph-based and centralized
    routing protocols [1,10,11,14,18,19], leading to a lack of global significance
    because Africa, which is the focus of this study, has less than 50% electricity/Internet
    coverage [27]. Also, ZigBee, Wi-Fi and cellular-based communication technologies
    with centralized or flooding-based routing architecture [1,10,11,14,18,19] are
    capital-intensive, complex to manage, location-restricted, energy-inefficient,
    and over-reliant on fixed supporting infrastructure. Therefore, an in-depth contextual
    assessment of how low-power communication standards such as LoRa, SigFox, and
    Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) evolve in cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) networks
    can be of immeasurable benefits to the IoT community and farmers. The role of
    Agri-IoT in eliminating food insecurity, improving crop quality, alleviating global
    poverty, and increasing agricultural production volumes has been underestimated
    [2,7,8,10,16,28,29]. The agricultural sector, which has been hindered by climate
    change, is the largest global employer [3]. To revitalize this sector, CA-IoT
    has emerged with the most promising opportunities to address food and employment
    insecurity issues and improve crop quality and economic conditions for the farmers.
    However, these benefits have not been fully realized due to insufficient research
    publicity. To the best of our knowledge, no survey or tutorial articles have sufficiently
    considered these technical issues and provided sufficient technical guidelines
    for the designers of Agri-IoT systems to make well-informed decisions in order
    to achieve satisfactory network performance. Additional realistic research is
    needed regarding the contextual evaluation of SN design and deployment factors,
    fundamental network design concepts and requirements, multi-objective optimization
    (MOO) analysis of the parameters for designing the associated routing protocol,
    and efficient operational metrics of the WSN sublayer of the Agri-IoT using the
    cluster-based architecture. In addition, the assessment of the possibility of
    using low-power and accessible wireless communication technologies such as BLE
    via cluster-based architecture to achieve a complete infrastructure-less, cheaper,
    energy-efficient, self-healing, adaptive, and robust Agri-IoT network is imperative.
    Furthermore, a broader contextual overview covering all vital aspects such as
    the fundamental concepts of Agri-IoT, technical design requirements of SNs and
    WSN-based Agri-IoT, surveys of the benchmarking communication standards, routing
    protocols, and testbed solutions, and an in-depth case study on how to design
    a self-healing, energy-efficient, adaptive, and CA-IoT based on the performance
    and users expectations are illustrated in Figure 2. Such a reference document
    can help support researchers when they attempt to accurately model and optimize
    the performance of Agri-IoT [14] so that the performance gap between the simulated
    networks and the realized Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1] can be addressed. By
    way of addressing these technical challenges, this tutorial presents the following
    contributions: Perform an in-depth synthesis and review (1) the basic concepts
    of Agri-IoT, (2) the comprehensive design considerations of these networks, (3)
    the technical design requirements of Agri-IoT, and (4) the up-to-date research
    progress on routing techniques, communication standards, and testbed solutions
    of WSN-based Agri-IoT. Systematically survey the benchmarking of WSN-based IoT
    networks’ communication standards, FM techniques, routing and MAC protocols, and
    realization testbeds to respectively uncover the appropriate communication requirements
    for Agri-IoT, unveil the root faults and possible remedies in the WSN sublayer,
    derive a generalized taxonomy of routing architectures, and define appropriate
    routing paradigms for WSN-based Agri-IoT using the core PHY layer design metrics:
    affordability, self-healing capacity, energy-efficiency, location independence,
    and network adaptability. Systematic synthesis of canon cluster-based routing
    protocols to uncover the plethora of possible research gaps, derive a realistic
    taxonomy of MOO metrics and propose possible MOO remedies that can be implemented
    using CA-IoT routing architecture freely available low-power communication standards.
    Proposition of MOO-induced guidelines in the form of open issues that can help
    Agri-IoT designers to build adaptive, robust, fault-tolerant, energy-efficient,
    affordable, and optimized CA-IoT networks in both simulation and real-world implementations.
    Overall, this tutorial is motivated to provide a contextualized, in-depth understanding
    of this technology and assist the reader in designing robust, affordable, and
    optimized Agri-IoT networks that can act as reliable game-changers to avert the
    stipulated challenges. Also, the critical design, deployment, and QoS requirements
    of WSN-based Agri-IoT networks from theoretical modeling to real-world deployment
    are unveiled in order to bridge the existing gap between the theory and practice
    of this technology [1,14]. The remainder of this paper is organized into the following
    sections: Section 2 provides a brief background comparative overview of WSN, IoT,
    and Agri-IoT technologies, while Section 3 focuses on their components, protocols,
    architectural layers, and proposed architectural layers for WSN-based Agri-IoT
    technology. Section 4 presents the detailed contextual design and implementation
    requirements of Agri-IoT networks, while Section 5 deduces the unique characteristics,
    challenges, and proposed performance expectations of the associated routing protocols
    for the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 present systematic
    surveys on routing protocols, FM techniques, and the canon real-world testbed
    implementations of WSN-based Agri-IoT solutions. Section 9 examines how the above
    discussions have evolved using a case study of cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)
    for precision irrigation.Section 10 unveils open issues and future works, while
    Section 11 concludes the paper. 1.1. Comparative Overview of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT
    Technologies A comparative overview of the underlying technologies (i.e., WSN,
    IoT, and Agri-IoT) forming the WSN-based Agri-IoT are compared from the perspective
    of architectural variations, users’ expectations, and design and implementational
    differences in Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT technologies.
    As depicted in Figure 3, WSNs are formed by spatially distributed, autonomous,
    resource-constrained SNs that wirelessly interconnect to communicate their sampled
    data to a BS for further monitoring or event tracking purposes without necessarily
    requiring the Internet. The main components of the WSN are the SNs, the BS/gateway,
    and the event sampling/routing software that supervises the entire network process.
    A node may route data directly or via relay SNs to the BS based on its location
    and assigned tasks. The BS locally takes actionable decisions and execution of
    the actuation actions. Although the WSNs are resource-constrained and fault-vulnerable,
    they constitute the inevitable part of this technology [2] and the underlying
    innovation of the WSN-based Agri-IoT framework. In contrast, classic IoT consists
    of IoT devices that sense and transmit their sampled information directly or via
    telemetry to the Internet for monitoring or event-tracking purposes, mostly via
    the centralized routing architecture. Like BS in WSNs, IoT devices can connect
    to the Internet/IoT cloud via fixed-line (thus, for a factory), 5G/4G/LTE cellular/mobile
    networks, or Wi-Fi for further processing, storage, and decisions/actions. Figure
    3. Generalized Agri-IoT framework consisting of: field layout overview of Agri-IoT
    framework (a), sample of classic Agri-IoT in the state of the art (b), and key
    components of an SN or a BS (c). As presented in Figure 4, WSN-based Agri-IoT
    is an information- and knowledge-intensive intelligent feedback control system
    for farm monitoring, data sampling/computing, resource optimization, automation
    of farm operation (e.g., precision irrigation, chemical application, livestock
    monitoring, and disease management [16]), and actionable decision making via a
    variety of battery-powered and wirelessly connected SNs with sensing, processing,
    and communication capacities [2,29,30]. Unlike the WSN, Agri-IoT and IoT sample
    data to an Internet-based cloud. The SNs that form the WSN sublayer are spatially
    distributed and self-configured to achieve a myriad of remote sensing, surveillance/monitoring,
    and control applications via automated sensing, wireless communication, and computing,
    making informed decisions and performing actuation control [31] using precise,
    accurate, and timely sampled information about a real-world phenomenon [32]. Figure
    4. Conceptual framework: Agri-IoT-based farm monitoring and control cycle. The
    main hardware components of an Agri-IoT framework, as presented in Figure 3 and
    Table 2, include the WSN (i.e., comprising the field-deployed SNs or IoT devices),
    a base station (BS) or gateway or actuator controller, cloud servers, and the
    user’s monitoring/control devices. The on-farm participants (e.g., SNs and BS)
    in Agri-IoT are mostly battery-powered and must be equipped with sensing, computing,
    and communication abilities to form infrastructure-less, robust, self-healing,
    and self-configured WSNs for data collection and event management [33]. The core
    units of the SNs in Figure 3c and the BS are compared and contrasted in Table
    2. As the framework in Figure 3a depicts, the IoT devices can sense, process,
    and transmit their sampled data directly to the Internet or IoT cloud without
    a gateway, whereas the SNs in WSN-based Agri-IoT perform likewise via a BS. This
    resource-sufficient BS interfaces between the IoT cloud/user and the WSN or actuator
    control system. It can also process the received data and locally execute actionable
    decisions via the actuator of the farm event being monitored. The received data
    can also be relayed to the analytical data engines in the IoT cloud via a wired
    and wireless medium for further processing and actions [13]. The resource-constrained
    WSN sublayer mainly uses data-centric protocols due to the SNs’ high deployment
    densities, high network dynamics, and limited power supply of SNs. Although data-centric
    protocols are fragile and not standardized, they are more suitable than the high
    resource-demanding ID-based IPv4 or IPv6 protocols in the addressing space of
    the WSN-based Agri-IoT. Table 2. Comparison of SN and BS. Agri-IoT combines WSN
    and IoT technologies into contextualized intelligent farm management systems to
    achieve higher event data quality and offer remote monitoring and control. WSN-based
    Agri-IoT consists of the WSN sublayer, the gateways, the cloud servers, and the
    remote interface application, as illustrated in Figure 3a and Figure 5. Uniquely,
    the current trends of Agri-IoT mandate that both intra-SN and BS–cloud communication
    are based on low-power, ubiquitous, and freely available wireless standards [2].
    Also, most Agri-IoT solutions support bidirectional communications between the
    BS/gateway and the cloud/users, whereby the BS updates the cloud/user database
    and receives actionable/control remote messages from the user or cloud analytical
    decision results for actuation purposes. The WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most dominant
    technology in the global smart farming use cases in the agricultural sector. The
    core tasks of SNs in a WSN-based Agri-IoT application, which are frequently supervised
    by the associated routing protocol, include network construction/management, data
    sensing, data processing/aggregation, fault tolerance, and communication [9,12].
    Also, the routing architecture must be supported by the associated communication
    platform and the application-specific requirements of the network. Figure 5. Proposed
    Agri-IoT architectural layers with core components of Agri-IoT ecosystem and the
    “things” taxonomy. Unlike IoT and WSN whose design expectations are application-specific,
    WSN-based Agri-IoT requires holistic integrations of the expectations in Figure
    2. 1.2. Classifications of IoT Applications and Specific Roles of Agri-IoT Generally,
    IoT technology is application-specific. However, it has limitless applications
    and roles in the smart world agenda. Based on their intended purpose, WSN-based
    IoT systems can be broadly classified into condition monitoring and event-tracking
    categories [34], as illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6. Generalized taxonomy of
    IoT applications. The monitoring-based applications involve real-time event data
    collection and analysis, supervision, and operational control of systems. In contrast,
    tracking-based applications track changes in the phenomenon of interest, such
    as the locations of objects, persons, transported goods, animals, and vehicles.
    Both application domains can be subdivided into industrial, environmental, and
    societal IoT applications in Figure 6, where specific examples are provided for
    each application domain. For instance, monitoring-based applications may include
    indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [6], industrial process monitoring [5,29],
    process control [2], greenhouse automation [7], precision agriculture (e.g., irrigation
    management, crop disease prediction, prediction of production quality, and pest
    and disease control) [2,8], biomedical or health monitoring [8], electrical grid
    network monitoring/control [12,29], military location monitoring [9], and so forth.
    Conversely, specific examples of tracking-based applications may include habitat
    tracking, traffic tracking, plant/animal condition tracking, and military target
    tracking, as outlined in Figure 6. 1.3. Agri-IoT Roles and Use-Cases The concept
    of intelligent farming involves data acquisition, data processing/planning, and
    smart control using the WSN and IoT technologies, big data, and cloud computing
    techniques to provide profitable solutions, as presented in Figure 7. These principal
    roles in Figure 7 define their use cases. For instance, monitoring the state of
    crops or the climate of the field using Agri-IoT technology can allow farmers
    to know precisely the amount of pesticides, water, and fertilizers required to
    attain optimal crop quality and production volume. However, the QoS requirements,
    the routing techniques, architectural requirements, and the operational dynamics
    differ from one use case to another. This tutorial focused on the critical and
    unique design requirements of WSN-based Agri-IoT, which is the backbone of the
    smart agricultural initiative [35]. The resulting use-cases in Figure 7 can be
    explained as follows: Figure 7. The roles of Agri-IoT in smart farming with specific
    use cases. Agri-IoT for Climate Condition or Agronomical Monitoring: This Agri-IoT
    system mostly comprises BS (i.e., weather stations) and a deployed WSN. The analytical
    data engines mine the sampled climate or crop condition data in the cloud to predict
    future climate conditions and farm automation plans. The most suitable crop and
    precise farming practices can then be predefined to improve agriculture production
    capacity and quality. Agri-IoT for Precision Farming: This is the most famous
    application of Agri-IoT, whereby farming practices (e.g., irrigation, fertilizer
    application, etc.) are precisely and accurately controlled to optimize these resources.
    Here, the SNs are mostly fitted with soil sensors to collect a vast array of microclimatic
    data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, and salinity) that can enable farmers
    to estimate optimal amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides needed by the
    crops to minimize resources’ costs and produce healthier crops. Additionally,
    the BS controls the event actuation system via accurate data-driven real-time
    decisions on the crops using climate data, crop growth data, and disease infection
    data. Agri-IoT for Greenhouse Automation: The Agri-IoT-based approach provides
    more accurate real-time information on greenhouse conditions, such as lighting,
    temperature, soil condition, and humidity, unlike manual greenhouse management.
    This allows precise remote monitoring and control or automation of all farming
    practices. Agri-IoT for Livestock Monitoring and Management: In this system, SNs
    are attached to livestock to monitor their real-time health, track their physical
    location, and log their performance. This helps the farmer identify and isolate
    sick animals to avoid contamination and reduce staffing expenses. Agri-IoT for
    Predictive Analytics: This Agri-IoT system provides highly relevant real-time
    data that can be analyzed to make essential predictions, such as crop harvesting
    time, risk of disease infection, yield volume, yield quality, and yield vulnerability,
    for proper planning. Agricultural Drones (Agri-Drones): Agri-Drones, such as DroneSeed,
    are fitted with mobile SNs and farming tools to collect agricultural data or perform
    activities such as field surveillance, crop planting, pest control, farm spraying,
    crop monitoring, etc. For example, for Agri-Drones, all the above use cases utilize
    the WSN-based Agri-IoT framework. 2. The Agri-IoT Ecosystem The authors in [1,14]
    established that the existing real-world attempts of Agri-IoT could not meet both
    performance and user users’ expectations because they are founded on the fundamental
    concepts and the operational principles of classic IoT and WSN technologies. To
    effectively achieve the expectations in Figure 2, it is imperative to conduct
    a systematic assessment of the related architectural layers in classic IoT and
    propose a suitable option for the WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem. Generally, the
    conventional IoT ecosystem consists of the network architectural layers and the
    data management platforms [2,7,8], which are further grouped into devices (sensors,
    actuators, and gateways/BS), network (BS to cloud), platforms/applications’ cloud,
    and agents/users. Due to the domain-specific requirements of IoT applications
    and the incorporation of numerous heterogeneous devices with application-specific
    requirements, there are generally no unified or standardized IoT architectural
    layers. Therefore, most application-defined layers are frequently adapted from
    the canon architectural layers, which include the three-layer [5], the cloud-based
    [7], the service-oriented architecture (SOA) [2,7], and the fog-based [2,7,29],
    as illustrated in Figure 8. Figure 8. Different architectural layers in the state
    of the art of IoT ecosystem. The fog-based architecture was adapted from the three-layer
    parent architecture to include cloud computing by offering computing, storage,
    and network information between the clients and the cloud services [29] in a decentralized
    manner. Here, cloud computing and fog/edge computing architectures only differ
    in where data computing occurs. These layers are not unified because the respective
    network layers do not cover all underlying technologies that transfer data to
    all IoT platforms [5]. Additionally, they are based on complicated centralized
    and flooding-based routing architectures, high-resource-demanding and capital-intensive
    Wi-Fi/cellular-based communication technologies. As well, they require wired infrastructural
    support in the farm, which is too complex, location-restricted, and capital-intensive
    for most low-income and non-expert farmers to implement and manage. Consequently,
    they are unsuitable candidates for the resource-constrained SNs in WSN-based Agri-IoT.
    By implication, there are no reference guidelines for designing Agri-IoT participants
    and supervisory protocols, controlling the speed of packet delivery, smoothing
    out SN’s integration, unifying technology, and creating standardized Agri-IoT
    reference models, among other considerations. In contrast, an Agri-IoT ecosystem,
    depicted in Figure 3, consists of: Agri-IoT network architectural layers: This
    shows how the physical network elements, network operation principles, and operational
    techniques interact throughout the entire ecosystem. Network supervisory software/routing
    protocol and routing architectures: This contains the virtual arrangement of multiple
    network elements [8] and the event sampling/routing protocol that constructs the
    routing architecture, supervises sampling and moderates all communications in
    the PHY layer. Data management platform: It hosts all high-resource-demanding
    data analytic engines, event databases, and remote control algorithms in a cloud
    model. 2.1. Proposed Architectural Layers for WSN-Based Agri-IoT In designing
    an efficient Agri-IoT system of global significance, it is imperative to propose
    suitable architectural layers and evaluate how the various components interact
    in these layers. With the emerging advances in low-power, freely available, and
    boundless communication standards (e.g., BLE) and unfulfilled potentials of CA-IoT
    network [12,16], a new framework of cluster-based architectural layers for the
    WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem is proposed in the left side of Figure 5. The center
    portion of Figure 5 presents the key components/technologies required in each
    layer, while the Things taxonomies of hardware components from the related literature
    [4,8,29] are depicted on the right portion of Figure 5. The underlying layers
    in our four-tier layers in Figure 5 can be elaborated on as follows: Integrated
    Application and Management Layer: This operates all agriculture-related applications
    that interface between the user (for example, farmer) and the Agri-IoT system
    to make decisions and execute remote actions to keep their crops or animals healthy.
    This layer manages the entire Agri-IoT system and its application-specific functionality,
    high-resource-demanding applications, and core business model in the cloud. This
    layer’s security requirements are crucial to the next sublayer; however, these
    are beyond the scope of this research. The business or management sublayer maintains
    end-to-end data integrity and security by ensuring that data are transferred to
    the correct user. It also ensures that the correct user executes the actuation.
    Information Management Layer: This handles data processing, storage, and other
    specialized cloud services and functionality that make precise, actionable decisions.
    In Agri-IoT, the sensory data are preprocessed locally to optimize communication
    power but can be further processed using analytic engines in the cloud for better
    decision making and remote monitoring and control. This layer can be embedded
    in the above application layers and hosted in the cloud in a typical Agri-IoT
    ecosystem. Network Management Layer: This layer discovers, connects, and translates
    devices over a network, and it coordinates with the above application layers.
    It also contains the BS, which interfaces the resource-constrained WSN and cloud
    information network. By convention, the WSN sublayer must utilize low-power communication
    standards such as Zigbee, SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Z-Wave, SigFox, and IEEE P802.11ah
    (low-power Wi-Fi), while the BS-to-Cloud connectivity can be achieved via the
    traditional cellular networks, satellite networks, Wi-Fi, LAN, WAN, and LoRa,
    among others. Unlike classic IoT, Agri-IoT requires that the BS-to-Cloud connectivity
    utilize low-power communication standards. Also, since every communication standard
    for the resource-limited WSN sublayer comes with unique resource specifications
    and design tradeoffs between power consumption, routing architectural constraints,
    and bandwidth [4,14,17], the best connectivity option must be selected to achieve
    the desired application goals. Consequently, the stated WSN-based connectivity
    technologies can be classified using several distinct parameters, such as energy
    consumption rates, uplink/downlink data rates, packet size, SN-count per BS (gateway),
    network routing topology, the SNs’ sensing range, the SNs’ transmitter/receiver
    power, frequency bandwidth, channel width, etc. (refer to the right portion of
    Figure 5). Physical/Perception/Things Layer: This layer refers to the field and
    all devices such as SNs, actuators, RFID tags, sensors, and edge devices that
    interact with the environment. This layer senses and collects the necessary information
    from the connected devices in the WSN sublayer to the BS. In Agri-IoT networks,
    the sampled microclimatic data can be processed and stored on the local BS, the
    cloud, or both. The activities in the cloud or application layers are beyond the
    scope of this tutorial. 2.2. Associated Hardware Components and Technologies Required
    in the Proposed Architectural Layers To precisely model and design an Agri-IoT
    network of desired expectations (refer to Figure 2) using the proposed architectural
    layers shown in Figure 5, the knowledge of the principal components and technologies
    used in each of these layers and how they interact and adapt for their intended
    functions is imperative. As depicted in the middle of Figure 5, the Agri-IoT ecosystem
    is composed of the following core components/technologies: Things: The Things
    unit is the physical interface between the tracked/monitored asset and the BS
    or actuator controller, which aligns with the physical or perception layer. It
    comprises the monitored/tracked asset (for example, field, crop, or animal), the
    SNs, or the entire IoT devices making up the WSN (for example, SNs, actuators,
    IoT-enabled devices, WSNs, and other smart devices), the event sampling, and routing
    technology in the WSN. Since the SNs constituting this unit are resource-constrained,
    freely available communication standards such as Zigbee, BLE, Z-Wave, and IEEE
    P802.11ah (low-power Wi-Fi) are the most suitable for both SN–SN and SN–BS communications.
    The Things unit accesses the cloud/Internet via gateways (BS). Gateway (BS): The
    BS interfaces the WSN out in the field and the applications situated in the cloud
    servers. This unit aligns with the network management and actuator control layer
    shown in the middle of Figure 5. The WSN sublayer may have more than one BS(s),
    each with the capacity to handle most resource-demanding computational tasks besides
    actuation execution, network construction, scheduling of event sampling, and network
    supervision services. They may also allow bidirectional communication with the
    cloud/user and WSN. Similar to standalone IoT devices, the BS can be equipped
    with 4G/5G/LTE/NB-IoT, cellular-based, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, or wired ethernet communication
    technologies to interact with the cloud, and low-power communication standards
    such as LoRa, low-power Wi-Fi, SIGFOX, UMTS, BLE, and Zigbee (Figure 5) to communicate
    with the sensor field. However, Agri-IoT networks require that both upper-layer
    and lower-layer communication technologies of the BS should be low-power, freely
    available, easy to deploy and manage, and platform-independent. The BS may preprocess
    or relay the raw data to the cloud for remote data processing. The BS(s) locations
    are strategically chosen to optimize network communication costs. IoT Cloud: The
    Cloud unit aligns with the applications layer. It consists of an on-premises or
    remote server farm that hosts the applications layer, event data analytic engines,
    security protocols, robust IoT applications, user interface, and event database.
    The high resource-demanding data-processing tasks are mostly executed by well-equipped
    cloud-hosted applications to manage and store huge amounts of data, provide monitoring
    and data analytical services, enable communication with devices, and manage information
    access. The merits of edge computing can be exploited to ensure that large amounts
    of data are post-processed off-device to reduce the response times of the cloud.
    User Interface: With the aid of a web or mobile app, the user or farmer can live-monitor
    the farm’s conditions and execute control actions. Additionally, a presentation
    or business intelligence layer may be added to coordinate the activities of non-technical
    business users through dashboards and reports rather than with the application
    layer itself. 2.3. Quality Expectations of Agri-IoT’s Architectural Layers Although
    there is no unified, certified, and flexible Agri-IoT architecture layer, any
    suitable options deduced from the benchmarking architectures in Figure 8 must
    satisfy certain quality requirements, including: Simultaneous data acquisition,
    analysis, and control from many sensors or actuators. Minimization of huge raw
    data transmissions via data aggregation techniques to maximize actionable information
    quality. Provision of reliable network architecture that supports energy-efficient
    routing, stable connectivity, self-adaptability, fault tolerance, operational
    simplicity/flexibility, platform independence, affordability, and location independence
    of Agri-IoT designs. Support for automated/remote device management and updates.
    Easy integration of each layer with existing applications and other IoT solutions
    via specified APIs. Utilization of freely available, location-unrestricted, cheap,
    energy-efficient, and simple to deploy and manage by non-experts [4,29] underlying
    communication technologies in the PHY and network layers as well as based on open
    standards to guarantee interoperability. 3. Design and Implementation of Agri-IoT
    Networks Despite the technical challenges associated with the WSN-based Agri-IoT,
    its potential contributions in the agricultural sector largely surpass the least
    complex, capital-intensive, pure IoT-based solutions, as illustrated in Figure
    3b and Figure 7. Due to the broader applicability and higher significance of the
    WSN-based Agri-IoT networks relative to the classic IoT networks, this study focuses
    on the former technology whose design and implementation involve four crucial
    phases, namely: Custom-building of robust, affordable, energy-efficient, location-independent,
    and adaptive SNs and a BS that can form an infrastructure-less and easily manageable
    WSN. The SNs and the BS must consist of cost-effective, architecture-defined,
    and context-defined components so that the system operates stably and efficiently,
    becomes affordable to farmers, and easily integrates to any real-world scenario
    without any expensive, fixed/wired backbone connections. The low-power capabilities
    of the SNs help to easily integrate them into any precision farms and greenhouses
    to operate over the entire crop season without many technical hindrances. Physical
    deployment of the SNs in the field, selection of the WSN’s communication technology,
    and design of a suitable supervisory protocol to coordinate the construction of
    appropriate event routing architecture, the duty-cycle schedule of event sampling
    to the BS, fault management, data management, and network maintenance. Additionally,
    a range of techniques such as network participant mobility, cross-layer design,
    MAC techniques, data aggregation, self-healing techniques, nodes’ duty-cycle schedule,
    security measures, localization, and communication specifications of the SNs can
    also be exploited in the associated routing protocols. Selection of appropriate
    BS/gateway communication technology and design of a suitable higher protocol to
    update the cloud database and execute the actuation actions based on users’ requests
    or decisions on processed event data. Design of data analytical engines and applications
    in the cloud and users’ remote monitoring and control interface app, which is
    beyond the scope of this tutorial. These call for a systematic application-specific
    assessment of the hardware components selected for every use case. 3.1. Sensor
    Nodes Design Considerations As illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3, a node for
    the WSN-based Agri-IoT network consists of four main units, which include the
    following: Sensing Unit: This unit interfaces with the physical environment and
    records the physical phenomenon of interest. The type of sensor is application-specific
    and can be contact-based or non-contact-based. For instance, the STEMMA soil moisture
    sensor and the DHT22 sensor can be used to sample environmental temperature and
    humidity (refer to Figure 3c). Controller Unit: This unit hosts the processor,
    storage, and connection pins for the other units and all auxiliary peripherals.
    The suitable controllers for building Agri-IoT SNs are Arduino-based and Raspberry-Pi-based
    (refer to the bottom of Figure 3) due to their ability to withstand extreme weather
    conditions. However, other off-the-shelf, application-specific controllers such
    as the ProPlant Seed Rate Controller, John Deere GreenStar Rate Controller, Viper
    Pro multi-function field computer, Radion 8140, Trimble Field-IQ, etc. are also
    available. Communication Unit: This unit is the principal determinant of the node’s
    power consumption, operational stability, and affordability, as well as the routing
    architecture in the associated supervisory protocol. The bottom of Figure 3 shows
    the available communication technologies, but an Agri-IoT-based SN demands an
    energy-efficient, affordable, freely available, simple, and reliable communication
    standard. Consequently, LoRa, BLE, ZigBee, LoRaWan, and SigFox are the best candidates
    based on the support of the routing architecture of the resulting WSN, but the
    selection must be justified from the technology requirement metrics via a decision
    matrix. Power Unit: Since the SNs are mostly battery-powered, the appropriate
    battery size and probable energy-harvesting techniques must be determined during
    the SNs’ design according to the intended network lifespan and stability requirements.
    Modern trends in battery power banks with integrated solar-based energy-harvesting
    systems and power ratings above 30,000 Ah are available. When selecting hardware
    components, adequate caution should be taken to avoid unit incompatibility, high
    operational complexities, unsuitable operational thresholds, and high energy consumption,
    among others. This implies that high component survivability and operational stability
    under different environmental conditions and the application specificities are
    vital to monitor. 3.2. Wireless Spectrum and Core Communication Platforms of WSN-Based
    Agri-IoT The wireless electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, which has invisible, finite
    radio frequencies for wireless communication, can be licensed and sold exclusively
    by specific providers or unlicensed for free usage. For instance, the Industrial,
    Scientific, and Medical (ISM) frequency band (e.g., Bluetooth classic, BLE, Wi-Fi,
    ZigBee, and LoRaWAN) is an unlicensed microwave frequency band clustered around
    2.4 GHz and globally reserved for applications such as Agri-IoT. Table 3 presents
    the various bands and their applications. A suitable candidate for a given Agri-IoT
    application is based on several factors, such as communication and the route architectural
    requirements, power consumption, cost, and environmental adaptability impacts.
    Table 3. Wireless spectrum with the core communication platforms/applications.
    3.3. Factors to Consider When Deploying SNs and Designing the Supervisory Sampling/Routing
    Protocol After custom-building or selecting off-the-shelf SNs, the next activity
    is to deploy the SNs on the field and design a contextualized supervisory protocol
    to coordinate the aforementioned network’s activities. The SNs’ deployment in
    the field can be either random or deterministic. Both options require different
    methods to optimize the resulting network’s performance. For instance, under the
    deterministic approach, the optimal parameters such as node uniformity and density
    must be predefined based on the distance thresholds of the associated communication
    technology (i.e., connectivity/distance range), the SNs’ resource optimization
    mechanisms, the type of routing architecture, and the sensing range of the physical
    parameter to be measured. Since communication is the principal power consumer,
    the best ways to conserve power are to minimize communication distance and data
    sizes as well as operate the SNs in the appropriate sleep–active duty cycles using
    a cluster-based routing architecture [9,24,26]. Beyond the physical installation
    of the SNs at their most suitable in-range locations, the remaining activities,
    such as network construction, event sensing, data management, FM, network maintenance,
    sleep–active duty-cycle scheduling of SNs for sampling, network adaptability to
    turbulent and scalable conditions, power-optimization mechanisms, and network
    reconfiguration, among others, are controlled by the associated routing protocol
    [12,16,17,26,36]. This places crucial merits on the physical locations of the
    SNs in the field, thorough synthesis of network design factors, and assessment
    of available routing architectures/techniques, since this protocol manages all
    post-deployment tasks. This can be summarized into the core objectives of the
    routing protocol and its architecture, which include power optimization, self-healing
    of any faults without the obstruction of its normal operation, and self-adaptability
    to all turbulent and scalable conditions. From the analysis above, we can derive
    the critical primary factors to consider when designing a routing protocol for
    Agri-IoT networks, which are presented in Figure 9 and grouped into the following
    categories: SNs specifications, security issues, application-specific factors,
    communication standard compatibility and capacities, and other auxiliary factors.
    At the PHY layer level, which is the focus of this tutorial, these critical factors
    can translate into the stipulated core design objectives, which can be addressed
    via phase-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) formulation frameworks [12,23,24,37].
    Figure 9. Principal design factors for Agri-IoT networks. Hardware Specifications
    of SNs and BS Agri-IoT Device: The functional and resource capacities of participants’
    hardware units must be considered before their respective tasks in the protocol
    are assigned. For instance, the selected sensors’ quality must suit the type of
    event information and its accuracy, the available communication platforms, and
    the general purpose of the Agri-IoT solution. Also, the communication standard
    must support the routing architecture and SNs’ resource- and deployment-induced
    limitations. The crucial communication-based parameters of the SNs are illustrated
    in Table 4. Table 4. Comparison of common communication platforms of the WSN sublayer
    of Agri-IoT. Cost or Affordability of the Resulting Agri-IoT System: In addition
    to being infrastructure-less, flexible, self-healing, adaptive, and energy-efficient,
    a WSN-based Agri-IoT must consist of cost-effective hardware and software components
    so that the system is affordable for farmers, since existing real-world solutions
    are too expensive and complicated [1,14]. Additionally, the installation, operational,
    and maintenance costs of the resulting WSN-based Agri-IoT network must be kept
    to a minimum so that it can be easily acquired. Security Issues in Agri-IoT: Security
    is still a challenge in classic IoT systems that handle sensitive information,
    especially during cloud communications. Although Agri-IoT networks lack the requisite
    resource capacities in most large-scale, broadcast-based, distributed, and infrastructure-less
    WSN systems to achieve adequate data confidentiality, authenticity, integrity,
    and other security requirements, the security of the agricultural data is rarely
    a priority [2,4]. Nevertheless, the associated routing architecture, such as the
    clustering architecture, has an embedded capacity to resolve on-site security
    issues. In addition, both on-site and remote information access types (e.g., via
    a smartphone or desktop computer) must be selected based on solid internal infrastructure
    and security precautions to secure unwanted access to sensitive information. The
    Application-Specific Factors: As indicated in Figure 9, the application-defined
    factors vary based on the Agri-IoT application, the field settings, network maintenance
    practices, intended event routing architecture, and network participants’ mobility,
    among other factors. However, the routing protocol must incorporate all relevant
    operational efficiency factors of the routing software design objectives. Since
    the collected field data itself cannot make sense without using analytic data
    engines and predictive algorithms in machine learning, the BS or the application
    layer in the cloud should define appropriate data-processing frameworks to obtain
    accurate, actionable decisions from the collected data. Communication Standards
    of Agri-IoT Devices: The power-constrained WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT network places
    hard restrictions on operational states of SNs’ radio transceivers, code space,
    and processing cycles as well as memory capacities of SNs to enhance power savings
    [9,12,23]. The type of communication technology selected for a typical Agri-IoT
    is the principal predictor of its routing architecture, affordability, simplicity,
    adaptability, power-saving capacity, location independence, self-healing capacity,
    and event data quality [12,16]. Consequently, power and routing architectural
    limitations constrain the network design requirements. Despite the aforementioned
    technical challenges on the network’s operational efficiency, interconnected SNs
    that form the WSN are expected to withstand extra operational disruptions caused
    by unfavorable weather conditions in the field [2,4]. Consequently, the de facto
    PHY-layer communication standards for this low-power, low bandwidth, and distance-limited
    communication Agri-IoT devices/SNs have been the energy-efficient platforms such
    as BLE, LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Also, a suitable MAC technique is imperative
    in the routing architecture to curb all channel access challenges. For instance,
    the ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard focuses on the physical and the MAC layer specifications
    for WSNs, and it also supports the sleep–active or duty-cycle scheduled operation
    modes of SNs to enhance energy savings in centralized or mesh-based architectures.
    BLE does likewise in the highly endowed cluster-based routing architecture. Consequently,
    Agri-IoT network designers must make the most appropriate and critical decisions
    regarding the network’s communication requirements when designing the routing
    protocol. Using Table 4, WSN-based Agri-IoT designers can make realistic design
    decisions regarding energy-efficient multihop routing, architectural requirements
    of routing protocol, bandwidth, routing table capacities, total communication
    cost, and the desired MAC technique. Additionally, the physical conditions within
    the agricultural environment such as atmospheric dust concentration, physical
    obstruction to wireless signal transmissions, and the terrain need to be considered.
    Auxiliary Factors and Available Software Tool: Finally, the auxiliary factors
    can be non-exhaustive depending on the designer’s financial capacity, user interface,
    information requisition model, cloud activities, operational expectations, and
    the available software tools. Additionally, an assortment of PHY-Layer design
    software tools for Agri-IoT experiments (thus, in both simulations and real-world
    testbed deployments) that can be used include NS-3 [9,38], OMNeT++, MATLAB/Simulink
    [9,12,39], Python [16], PAWiS [39], GloMoSim/QualNet [39,40], OPNET [12,39], SENSE
    [37,39], J-Sim [39], Ptolemy II [39], Shawn [9,39], and PiccSIM [12,39,41], among
    others. The key features that are frequently considered when selecting any of
    these software platforms include Python or MATLAB/Simulink compatibility for software
    model and hardware prototype integration during real-world operation, compatibility
    with low-power communication standards (e.g., BLE, LoRa, ZigBee, and SIGFOX),
    operating system support, programming language implementation, the density of
    simultaneously simulated or field-deployed SNs, co-simulation with other hardware,
    documentation, easy access to upgraded versions, and installation challenges [39].
    MATLAB/Simulink and Python are the most commonly used experimental tools, since
    these software tools are well-equipped with the stipulated features. 4. Unique
    Characteristics and Challenges of WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT Unlike the traditional
    IoT, which generally relies on fixed hardware to route network traffic, a WSN
    sublayer of Agri-IoT combines automated sensing, computation, actuation, and wireless
    communication tasks into the SNs that are spatially distributed across the farm
    to autonomously form an infrastructure-less WSN [31]. A node may perform additional
    tasks such as local data processing (data aggregation), network construction,
    data redundancy, error control, data routing (e.g., in multihop networks), and
    network maintenance practices based on the network size, application specificity,
    and associated routing techniques. Also, the WSN can be equipped to observe heterogeneous
    conditions such as temperature, humidity, sound, color, location, light, vibration,
    and motion, using a wide variety of sensors contained within a task-scalable SN.
    Therefore, assuming that the accuracy and precision of event data in upper layers
    are preserved, the Agri-IoT’s lifespan and its operational efficiency are rooted
    in the WSN’s robustness. Thus, a deeper contextual exegesis into the design and
    maintenance of this sublayer is imperative. As opposed to conventional IoT and
    wireless ad hoc communication networks, the operational efficiency of the WSN
    sublayer, as well as Agri-IoT, hinge upon some application-specific characteristics
    and resource-constrained factors such as: Higher SN Deployment Densities: Generally,
    SNs are densely deployed in either a deterministic or random manner to provide
    the desired redundancies, spatial variability of soil, topography, distributed
    monitoring and processing, accurate and precise event reporting, and fault tolerance.
    However, this mostly leads to undesirable transmission overlaps, data redundancies
    from the simultaneous reporting of the same data, routing interferences, and packet
    collisions due to connectivity issues and the coexistence of common standards
    in the ISM band [42]. Limited Power Supply: The SNs are frequently battery-powered,
    which does not only constrain their data transmission rate, computational capabilities,
    and communication distance but also subjects Agri-IoT to possible SN-out-of-service
    and data outlier faults due to rapid power depletion beyond certain thresholds
    [26,43]. Consequently, network power management through data-management-related,
    architectural-related, and communication-related parameters has been one of the
    principal research focuses in WSN-based IoT applications to improve network lifetime.
    Fault Management (FM) (i.e., fault detection, fault tolerance, or fault avoidance):
    The resource-constrained WSN is highly vulnerable to faults and failures due to
    high deployment densities and a lack of post-deployment maintenance services [25].
    Although faults are inevitable in Agri-IoT for the stipulated reasons, their occurrence
    rates and effects on the network’s functionality can be minimized, avoided, or
    tolerated without hindering the normal functionality of the network if the associated
    WSN’s routing protocol is well-equipped with efficient self-healing and fault-avoidance
    (power-saving) mechanisms [12]. Self-Adaptability and Scalability: Although WSNs
    are application-specific, the topological dynamism is inevitable due to node failures,
    node mobility, and scalable conditions. Therefore, the associated routing protocol
    and network architecture must adapt to these dynamic conditions using apt auto-reconfiguration
    and reactive multihop event routing techniques [44,45]. Network Architecture:
    The underlying routing protocol of the WSN sublayer constructs a network architecture
    that can be flat, hierarchical (e.g., clustering, chain-based, and tree architectures)
    or location-based. This routing architecture prescribes the possible measures
    to achieve efficient local data processing, network maintenance, scalability,
    minimized communication overhead, prolonged network lifespan, and reduced network
    management complexities [25,36]. Therefore, a suitable network topology indirectly
    determines the resulting network’s flexibility, scalability, reliability, communication
    strategy/costs, and the quality of the reported event data [12]. Mostly Requires
    On-site Actuation: Regardless of where data are managed in a typical WSN-based
    Agri-IoT, the actionable decision signal must be sent to execute on-farm actuation.
    Proposed Design Objectives of WSN-Based Routing Protocols for Agri-IoT and Realization
    Mechanisms From the systematic evaluation of the unique characteristics and challenges
    of the WSN sublayer, a three-tier cluster-based framework that constitutes the
    condensed expected core design objectives and their corresponding remedial strategies
    of WSN-based routing protocols for Agri-IoT applications is demonstrated in Figure
    10. Suppose the corresponding remedies in Figure 10 are implemented in the associated
    routing protocol. In that case, the desired power optimization, self-healing,
    and auto-adaptability expectations can transitively yield the desired event data
    quality and operational stability requirements or the global performance expectations
    of the resulting network. Figure 10. Proposed design objectives and strategies
    of WSN-based Agri-IoT routing protocols. The importance of this three-tier framework
    can be expanded on as follows: An adaptive and scalable WSN-based routing protocol,
    as proposed in Figure 10, normally constructs a routing architecture that supports
    multihop routing, self-reconfiguration, self-healing, and local network administration
    at a minimal routing table size, communication cost, and and control message complexity
    requirement. Since communication is the principal power consumer, the operation
    of the routing protocol must invlove fewer control messages. Also, it must adapt
    to network turbulence due to SN failures. The cluster-based architecture exhibits
    the highest potential compared to related architectures [9,16,17,26]. The cluster
    heads (CHs) efficiently coordinate these activities by registering and tolerating
    all dynamism resulting from SN-out-of-service faults, increasing the network size
    and SN density. Due to the high vulnerability of SNs to faults and failures, it
    is imperative to deploy suitable FM techniques that can detect, tolerate, or avoid
    possible root faults such as SN-out-of-service and data outliers [25]. The adaptive
    clustering approach can effectively resolve SN-out-of-service faults, while the
    threshold-based decision theory at the local nodes and global levels can be suitable
    candidates for event data outlier detection and correction in the PHY layer. Since
    power mismanagement is the root cause of most faults and failures, the best fault-avoidance
    techniques optimize the nodes’ power consumption rates. Figure 10 also outlines
    the suitable measures for power optimization in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT.
    In clustering approaches, power consumption in the constrained WSN can be managed
    via message complexity control, connectivity-related metrics, and communication-related
    parameters by exploiting the clustering architecture [46]. In addition to local
    data processing (data aggregation, data redundancy, and error checks) and local
    network administration (FM, adaptability to network dynamics), suitable MOO and
    multihop routing frameworks can be derived using the clustering architecture,
    total communication cost, and optimal cluster quality metrics to serve as a design
    optimization guide for the simulation and real-world implementations of the WSN
    phase of Agri-IoT. To achieve the expectations in Figure 10, there is a need for
    an architecture-specific multi-objective assessment of the WSN’s design cycle;
    from this, the associated parameters and theoretical models can be derived and
    then theoretically optimized and validated experimentally. A novel holistic MOO
    framework can help realize these expected goals in both simulation and real-world
    Agri-IoT implementations. Consequently, there exists the need to carry out a systematic
    survey and assessment on existing routing architectures, FM schemes, and routing
    protocols, and how these evolved in existing real-world realization testbeds of
    Agri-IoT. Such an in-depth literature synthesis can help assess these qualitative
    performance indicators constituting the root QoS metrics in Figure 10 as well
    as deduce application-specific guidelines for improving CA-IoT networks using
    a precision irrigation system as a case study. 5. State of the Art on Routing
    Protocols for WSN-Based Agri-IoT Applications In Agri-IoT, it is not simply a
    matter of applying IoT to a farm; contextual due diligence on architecture, communication
    standard, cost, actuator, performance stability, control, and environmental impacts
    augment the routing protocol requirements. This section presents a systematic
    synthesis of WSN-applicable routing protocols under network architecture, the
    route discovery process, and protocol operation as illustrated in Figure 11. To
    help Agri-IoT designers make well-informed decisions concerning architectural
    selection, we classified the canon protocols based on routing architecture, route-discovery
    process, and operations in order to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and contextual
    reasons why they can be adopted for Agri-IoT applications. Generally, event routing
    in every protocol can either be source-initiated or destination-initiated, and
    the optimal path selection from the constructed routing architecture can also
    be broadcast-based, probabilistic, cluster-based, or parameter-determined using
    location-related, weight-based, and content-based metrics [13]. Also, routing
    protocols must commonly resist link failures using mechanisms that ensure balanced
    network-wide power depletion rates, energy-efficient multihop routing, and effective
    implementation of the indispensable QoS metrics presented in Figure 10. The related
    routing protocols can be classified as illustrated in Figure 11. Figure 11. Taxonomy
    of WSN-based routing protocols of Agri-IoT. 5.1. Architectural-Based Routing Protocols
    This class of protocols presented in Figure 11 and Figure 12 can be sub-grouped
    into flat-based centralized or direct communication and decentralized [47] (e.g.,
    flooding/peer-to-peer/graphical/mesh-like architectures), hierarchical/cluster-based/tree
    architectures, and the location-based protocols [37]. Figure 12. Sample network
    architectures: centralized-data-centric, cluster-based, and graph/flooding-based
    architectural frameworks of WSN sublayer. The centralized protocols route data
    to the BS via single-hop routing, while the flooding and graph-based protocols
    flood data through multihop routing. The graph-based routing protocols construct
    a reactive or proactive graphical routing architecture with 𝐺(𝑉,𝐸) where a node
    and path represent the vertex and edges, respectively. This method relies on resource-intensive
    routing techniques from graph theory used in classic IoT and ad hoc networks to
    transmit event data to the BS. In contrast, the clustering/tree topology depicted
    in Figure 12 groups the SNs into either static or dynamic clusters, each with
    an optimally selected CH to minimize the communication distances of the cluster’s
    member nodes (MN). The CH is then tasked with aggregating the received readings
    from its MNs, executing error and measurement redundancy checks, and communicating
    directly (single-hop routing) or via a relay CH (RCH) using a multihop routing
    technique to the sink node or BS. However, the RCHs must be assigned fewer MNs
    to balance the network’s power depletion rates, since aggregated packet forwarding
    inflicts extra energy burden on the RCHs [37]. Additionally, the CH can be equipped
    to perform extra roles such as FM, coordination of the reclustering process, network
    maintenance, relaying of aggregated packets in large-scale networks, and management
    of network dynamism [12]. In general, cluster-based routing protocols differ in
    terms of CH selection methods and coincide in terms of intra-cluster and inter-cluster
    multihop routing, local data processing by the CHs, and CH role rotation [47],
    which ensure balanced network-wide power depletion, prevent abrupt power exhaustion,
    and lead to exponential energy savings [37]. Although the flat-based architectures,
    such as centralized and flooding (see Figure 12), can be easily implemented in
    real-world small-scale Agri-IoT networks, they suffer severe packet collisions,
    communication bottlenecking at the BS, and high inaptness for scalable or turbulent
    large-scale WSNs where energy efficiency is a priority. Again, an optimized clustering
    approach can provide an ideal topology for addressing the proposed expectations
    in Figure 10, and it can also offer extra benefits such as minimized communication
    cost, stabilized network topology, efficient load management, improved network
    maintenance, and improved network traffic and channel access management [37,48].
    The main challenge of the clustering method is how to achieve the desired cluster
    quality (e.g., optimal cluster count and cluster size) so that the computational,
    bandwidth, memory, and routing table capacities of the resource-constrained CHs
    are not exceeded. Typical examples of clustering protocols are the LEACH family
    of protocols, which include RCEEFT, ESAA, DEEC, SEP, and PEGASIS in [12]. In location-based
    routing architectures, routing decisions are made either reactively (e.g., Ad
    hoc On-demand Distance Vector—AODV) or proactively (e.g., RPL—Routing over Low-Power
    and Lossy Networks protocol), using the SNs’ location information. This normally
    results in a decentralized, graphical architecture. Since the SNs that form the
    WSN are spatially deployed in the field without any IP-addressing schemes, location
    information is needed in order to establish communication between the nodes in
    a location-based architecture. The location information helps eliminate unwanted
    transmissions by collecting data from a specific region of interest. This architecture
    suffers from routing delays, high infrastructural cost, extreme difficulties in
    deployment and management, and high energy waste due to SNs’ long idling durations.
    However, they are the most commonly used protocol in existing ZigBee-based Agri-IoT
    testbed solutions [1,10,14,17]. Since this approach yields non-energy-aware architectures,
    it is not suitable for Agri-IoT applications [12]. It is evident from the above
    discussions that Agri-IoT-based network architectures must be defined by the associated
    routing protocol using the design requirements in Figure 9 as well as the application-defined
    requirements [49] in order to enhance the performance expectations in Figure 10.
    In addition, the routing architecture must not compromise on the quality, precision,
    and accuracy of the event information. It must be in unison with the application-specific
    requirements to address possible deployments- and network-induced challenges,
    such as network turbulence and SN mobility. 5.2. Route Discovery-Based Protocols
    As shown in Figure 11, route discovery-based protocols focus on when the route
    for data transmission is built and can be grouped into proactive, reactive, and
    hybrid protocols. In proactive routing protocols, the routes are pre-created before
    they are needed. These protocols are table-driven, since every node stores a large
    routing table containing a list of all possible destinations, next-hop neighbors
    to those destinations, and the associated costs of all next-hop options. Proactive
    protocols such as the RPL and the APTEEN family of protocols [15] make local routing
    decisions using the routing table’s content. For instance, the RPL operates as
    a distant-vector protocol for IPv6 low-power devices, utilizes the ZigBee/IEEE
    802.15.4 standard on established IP infrastructure, and also supports the 6LoWPAN
    adaptation layer. RPL creates a multihop tree routing hierarchy of SNs, such that
    nodes can send data through their respective parent nodes to the BS/sink node
    in a flooded manner (Figure 12). Similarly, the BS or sink node can send a unicast
    message to a specific SN in order to complete a bidirectional operational framework
    of RPL. The optimal communication costs and routes are estimated by ranking the
    associated objective function (OF) metrics, which can be single-objective optimization,
    SOO metrics, or MOO metrics. This routing over LLNs (RoLL) restricts densely deployed
    and resource-limited SNs to communicate using peer-to-peer or extended star network
    topologies [13]. Technically, RPL builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with no
    outgoing edges from the root element (e.g., BS) to eliminate loops. RPL is the
    primary underlying routing protocol in most failed Agri-IoT testbed attempts.
    Although the proactive or RPL-based family of protocols are robust, reliable,
    scalable, and can relatively operate at minimized control messages with the help
    of timers, they are not suitable for Agri-IoT networks due to these technical
    challenges: The core of RPL/proactive protocols still suffers from key challenges
    such as energy wastage, a lack of adaptability/scalability, reliability, congestion,
    and security issues. Specifically, the energy expended by RPL-inherited protocols
    to create routes (e.g., establish and maintain routing tables) and transmit data
    can be too high for resource-constrained SNs in recent Agri-IoT applications.
    The underlying technology of RPL (e.g., ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, or IPv6) was designed
    for energy-sufficient devices with high processing and memory capacities. Therefore,
    RPL is inapt for typical resourced-constrained Agri-IoT networks (refer to Table
    5). They require costly fixed IP infrastructural supports and utilize the centralized
    routing architecture, which becomes practically impossible to manage as the network
    scales. Table 5. Comparison of some cardinal hierarchical WSN-based routing protocols
    for Agri-IoT in state of the art. Conversely, the source-initiated reactive or
    on-demand routing protocols only create the routes on-demand by a source to send
    data to a receiver. Reactive protocols (e.g., Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector,
    AODV Protocol [13]) have no specific procedures for creating and updating routing
    tables with route information at regular intervals. For instance, the AODV is
    a loop-free, self-starting, and reactive routing protocol meant for LLNs (e.g.,
    WSN-based IoT) that are characterized by node mobility, link failures, and packet
    losses. AODV mainly consists of the route discovery process (RREQ and RREP messages)
    and route maintenance (RERR and HELLO messages). Although reactive or AODV-based
    protocols can adapt to network dynamics and eliminate periodic updates, the associated
    flooding-based route–search process incurs severe overheads resulting in high
    control message complexity, high route acquisition latency, and high energy wastages
    due to longer SN idling periods. Consequently, these protocols are unsuitable
    for power-constrained WSN-based Agri-IoT applications. The hybrid-based routing
    protocols merge the features of both reactive and proactive routing processes.
    However, hybrid protocols such as APTEEN [13] also require expensive fixed infrastructural
    support, which renders them unsuitable for Agri-IoT, even if the combined merits
    of reactive and proactive protocols are exploited. A comparative assessment of
    the strengths and weaknesses of the parent WSN-based routing protocols for Agri-IoT
    applications is illustrated in Table 5. 5.3. Operation-Based Routing Protocols
    Finally, routing protocols can be classified based on the operation or communication
    model employed, which may include: Negotiation-Based Protocols: These protocols
    exchange negotiation messages or use meta-data negotiations between neighboring
    SNs before the actual data transfers to reduce redundant transmissions in the
    network. A typical example is the SPIN family of protocols [13]. Multipath-Based
    Protocols: These use multiple routes simultaneously to accomplish higher resilience
    to route failure (i.e., fault tolerance) and load balancing. Query-Based Routing
    Protocols: These are receiver-initiated protocols whereby a destination node broadcasts
    a query to initiate a data-sensing task from a node through the network. A node
    having the data being queried sends it in response to the query. Coherent and
    Non-Coherent Protocols: The coherent routing method forwards data for aggregation
    after a minimum local pre-processing. However, in non-coherent routing, the nodes
    locally process the raw data before routing to the BS for further processing.
    QoS-Based Routing Protocols: These protocols’ purpose is to satisfy a specific
    QoS metric or multiple QoS metrics such as low latency, energy efficiency, or
    low packet loss. These protocols ensure a balance between energy consumption and
    data quality in every event-reporting task. In addition to route architectural
    construction and data transmission, efficient MAC must be embedded in the routing
    protocol to manage the wireless medium access and the duty-cycle/sampling schedules
    of the deployed SNs in Agri-IoT networks. As opposed to classic IoT, the MAC techniques
    in Agri-IoT are architecture-defined by the associated routing protocol to meet
    the energy efficiency requirements of the network via channel access management
    (CAM) and the moderation of the active–sleep duty cycles of the deployed SNs to
    save extra energy. The next subsection presents a concise overview of MAC techniques
    and their roles in WSN-based Agri-IoT networks. 5.4. MAC Techniques and Requirements
    for Agri-IoT Next to node deployment, the routing protocol defines the network
    architecture and selects a suitable MAC technique and a communication pattern
    for the routing architecture. Unlike classic IoT, requirements for Agri-IoT applications
    include a low control message complexity and low latency MAC technique that moderates
    sampling schedules, access to a shared medium, transceiver operation modes, (e.g.,
    packet transmission and reception, retransmission, collision, over-hearing, overhead
    handling, and idle listening) active–sleep duty cycles of the deployed SNs, and
    transceiver channels. Thus, an MAC protocol for WSN-based Agri-IoT applications
    must be architecture-specific and adaptive to network dynamics such as data transmission
    errors, interferences/packet collisions, and regular interfacing of the active–sleep
    duty-cycled schedules of the SNs’ transceiver states (e.g., transmitting state,
    receiving state, idle state, and sleep state [52]) during packet transmission
    and reception in order to improve network throughput, energy efficiency, latency,
    and other QoS metrics. Unlike MAC protocols for classic IoT, an efficient MAC
    technique for Agri-IoT must ensure exponential energy savings via channel assignment
    management (CAM) and active–sleep duty-cycle coordination in both time and channel
    perspectives. Based on these common dual tasks of Agri-IoT-based MAC (thus, duty-cycle
    optimization—DCO and channel access management—CAM), existing IoT-based MAC techniques
    can be classified as illustrated in Figure 13 and the state of the art in Table
    6. Figure 13. Proposed functionality-based MAC classification framework. Table
    6. Summary of state of the art on duty-cycle and CAM MMAC protocols. The CAM role
    eliminates packet collisions, overhearing, and over-emitting to ensure the desired
    functional balance, while the DCO task minimizes idle listening. A comparative
    assessment of related MAC methods used in recent WSN-based Agri-IoT applications
    in Table 6 affirms the need for further research on the functionality balance
    between DCO and CAM as well as a context-based MMAC approach for the LEACH family
    of protocols used in Agri-IoT applications. 5.5. Overall Perspective This section
    systematically surveyed core Agri-IoT-based routing protocols and evaluated the
    parent protocols (i.e., RPL, AODV, and LEACH/cluster-based families of protocols)
    for classic WSN-based IoT networks, of which LEACH-based methods are the best
    candidates for the resource-limited WSN-based Agri-IoT. However, the RPL and AODV
    have received more research considerations in terms of realizations in both simulations
    and practice [9,12,21]. Although the cluster-based architecture has unique endowments
    for realizing the proposed expectations in Figure 2 and Figure 10, it lacks an
    in-depth design synthesis in the current state of the art that can uncover its
    contextualized performance optimization modalities for real-world Agri-IoT applications.
    In addition, the deployment requirements with trending technologies such as BLE,
    LoRaWAN, SigFox, 5G, LoRa via Satellite, and NB-IoT under both simulation and
    real-world operational conditions is imperative. Consequently, the following sections
    present in-depth overviews on FM, the benchmarking of WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed
    solutions, clustering methods in the existing state of the art, and how the possible
    deductions from these syntheses can evolve in a typical case-study such as a WSN-specific
    Agri-IoT routing protocol for precision irrigation. 6. State of the Art on FM
    Techniques for Classic WSN Sublayer of IoT Since faults and failures are inevitable
    in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks (refer to Figure 10), it is imperative
    to reevaluate the faults, causes, types, strengths/weaknesses of existing FM (i.e.,
    fault detection—FD, fault tolerance—FT, and fault-avoidance—FA) schemes, revisit
    their founding assumptions [71], and make appropriate recommendations for Agri-IoT
    network designers. In this section, we establish the root source/cause(s) of faults
    in the WSN sublayer by assessing the behaviors of the different fault types, examining
    the extent to which the existing FM schemes address these root faults, and exploring
    how these schemes will evolve in realistic WSN-based Agri-IoT networks based on
    their core assumptions, control message overheads/complexities, and energy-saving
    capacities. From this thorough assessment, this section proposes practical fault-avoidance-based
    FM techniques for the next generation of WSN-based Agri-IoT. 6.1. Systematic Overview
    of Faults, Sources, and Taxonomy of Faults in Agri-IoT According to the fault–error–failure
    cycle depicted in Figure 14, a fault can be defined as any impairment that causes
    a system to produce erroneous results or leads to the failure of the entire system
    or specific components [72]. The prevalence of faults in WSN-based Agri-IoT is
    primarily due to the SN component malfunction, lack of post-deployment maintenance,
    or resource exhaustion [73], which can lead to either impaired event data quality
    (thus, sensory data error/outlier) or SN-out-of-service (thus, the shortened lifespan
    of SNs) [25]. Figure 14. Fault–error–failure cycle [72]. Due to the high susceptibility
    of WSNs to faults, the supervisory routing protocol is expected to incorporate
    efficient FM mechanisms that can guarantee optimum event data quality and network
    availability. By implication, FM algorithms for WSNs must not be stand-alone as
    currently seen in the state of the art [73]; instead, they must be an integral
    aspect of the routing protocol that agrees with the core participants of the PHY
    layer, such as the SN, wireless communication medium, and the BS. As illustrated
    on the left of Figure 15, the WSN sublayer is the most prevalent source of faults
    in the Agri-IoT ecosystem, in which the SNs are the central origin of faults that
    can propagate to the upper layers [25,43,73]. This is because the BS is resource-sufficient
    mainly, and the link’s reliability also hinges upon the SNs’ availability, as
    indicated in Figure 15. At the local SN’s level, each unit depicted at the bottom
    of Figure 3 is a potential source of fault/failure, but the degree of prevalence
    is frequently accelerated whenever power consumption is mismanaged through the
    disregard of any of the network design requirements and deployment conditions
    presented in later sections. Figure 15. Faults in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT:
    sources and fault propagation model. The different taxonomies of faults in the
    state of the art of the WSN sublayer [44,71,73,74,75,76,77], as illustrated on
    the left side of Figure 16, can be compared as follows: Figure 16. Classification
    of faults in the state of the art and proposed fault taxonomies for WSN-based
    Agri-IoT. Hard or permanent fault refers to the inability of a node to stay active
    and communicate due to resource exhaustion or component malfunction, while in
    soft or static faults, nodes continue to work and communicate with other nodes,
    but they sense, process, or transmit erroneous data [44,74]. The authors in [75,78]
    categorized faults as permanent (refers to SN-out-of-service faults), transient
    (caused by temporary conditions), intermittent (shows sporadic manifestations
    due to unstable behavior of hardware and software), and potential (due to depletion
    of hardware resources [78]). Data inconsistency faults can also result from faulty
    sensing, processing, and communication, which is frequently caused by power depletion
    below a certain threshold, while power failure occurs when a node exhausts its
    battery power completely [43,77,79]. The authors in [73] classified faults into
    software and hardware faults based on software and hardware impairments, respectively.
    According to [71], faults can be either time-based, due to the depreciation of
    hardware components with time, or behavioral-based, due to SNs’ inability to cope
    with harsh environmental and operating conditions. From the above definitions
    and the fault taxonomies on the left side of Figure 16, it can be deduced that
    hard, permanent, and static faults are practically manifested as SN-out-of-service,
    while soft, dynamic, and data-inconsistency faults can be observed as data outliers.
    Both SN-out-of-service and data outliers are consequences of unit malfunction
    or resource exhaustion and can be permanent or intermittent in behavior. Both
    conditions can impair the quality of event data and the global actionable decisions
    of the network. Therefore, the quality of FM schemes can be evaluated based on
    their capacities to effectively detect, tolerate, or avoid SN-out-of-service and
    data outlier faults. In summary, most FM schemes in the state of the art focus
    on their effects, instead of the root faults, which are the flaws in existing
    FM schemes [25]. Additionally, since the SN is the sole network device responsible
    for event sensing, data computation, packet forwarding, and communication in the
    WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT, it is the principal source of faults in Agri-IoT networks.
    A new fault classification framework shown in Figure 16 can be deduced from the
    above analysis. Secondly, it is discernible that SNs’ power mismanagement is the
    most prevalent origin of faults [43,80,81], which then propagate to the backend
    or application level (refer to the right side of Figure 15). For instance, communication,
    sensing, and computational accuracies of a node can be impaired when the battery
    energy falls below certain thresholds [43]. Also, network faults can be traced
    to power exhaustion and node failures, which create holes in the topology that
    divide the network into multiple disjointed segments [43]. On that account, faults
    can be avoided in WSN-based Agri-IoT if the energy-saving strategies presented
    in Figure 9 and Figure 10 are effectively implemented. Additionally, any FM scheme
    or fault-monitoring mechanism, be it proactive, reactive, passive, or active,
    must incorporate the following underlying qualities: thresholds that represent
    the probable fault conditions without false alarms, fault discovery, minimized
    message/time complexities, and self-healing and self-reconfiguration to neutralize
    the effects of the faults [43]. FM Framework and Architectures in WSN Sublayer
    of Agri-IoT As illustrated in Figure 17, every FM scheme consists of three main
    steps, which include fault detection (FD), fault diagnosis, and fault recovery/tolerance
    (FT) [82,83], which always require input information. These steps are implemented
    in a decision-making framework that involves four major processes: data/information
    collection, FD model formulation, FD decision and fault classification, and tolerance
    of its effects using any of the FT mechanisms shown in Figure 17. Thus, the FD
    model detects the fault, the fault discovery technique distinguishes that fault
    from false alarms, while the FT mechanism helps to auto-heal and recover from
    the faults or failures [84]. Mainly, SN-out-of-service faults are detected and
    tolerated using self-reconfiguration techniques, whereas data outlier faults must
    strictly follow Figure 17. Figure 17. FM framework in WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT.
    In addition, FM schemes can be implemented using either a centralized or distributed
    architecture [44,85,86]. In a centralized scheme, the FD/FT protocol is hosted
    and managed on the BS, whereas the distributed scheme hosts and manages this algorithm
    on the local SNs [87,88] (see Figure 17). The centralized approach is simpler
    for small-scaled networks but suffers many technical challenges, such as common
    point failure due to heavy message traffic at the BS and high SN energy waste.
    In contrast, the distributed approach saves power and controls message traffic
    on the BS because it allows local decision and self-FD/FT with or without neighboring.
    According to Figure 17, the distributed architecture can be implemented in three
    major ways [43,89,90,91], which include self-detection, neighbor coordination,
    and the clustering approach. Since the basic design requirement of a WSN-based
    Agri-IoT is to maintain the healthy functionality and longevity of the SNs and
    the BS, any post-deployment impairments that cannot be self-fixed must be tolerated
    to not interfere with the core function of the network. Therefore, any automated
    FT mechanism that can be achieved through the self-reconfiguration and self-management
    for enhanced network availability, reliability, and dependability is encouraged
    in the WSN sublayer [92]. According to Figure 17, an efficient WSN-based Agri-IoT,
    therefore, requires a calculated mix of FT mechanisms based on the intended application.
    6.2. Systematic Survey of Fault Management Schemes in WSN-Based IoT FM in Agri-IoT
    networks has not received adequate conceptualized research considerations. As
    a result, existing Agri-IoT solutions inherit the FM propositions from the traditional
    WSN-based IoT networks, which have proven to be unsuitable [14]. This subsection
    presents a concise overview of these FM schemes, including their strengths, weaknesses,
    and underlying theories/concepts. It then proposes a more suitable remedy for
    WSN-based Agri-IoT technology. In canon centralized FM schemes (see references
    in [93,94,95,96,97]), the underlying FM algorithm is hosted and managed on the
    BS, while the local SNs host and manage the FM algorithm in distributed architectures
    [87,88]. Although the centralized approach is simpler for small-scale networks,
    it suffers many technical challenges, such as common point failure due to heavy
    message traffic at the BS, management difficulties, and high energy wastages on
    distant routing. This clearly explains why most outdoor Agri-IoT testbed experiments
    in [1,10,11,14,18,19] experienced severe FM complications to the extent that the
    networks became infeasible to operate or manage at higher scalability levels.
    However, the distributed approach (see references in [74,76,77,91,98,99,100,101,102,103])
    saves power and controls message traffic and workload on the BS because it allows
    local decisions as well as local-FD/FT with or without neighboring nodes. The
    distributed FD/FT scheme can also be self-executed, neighbor-coordinated, or clustering-aided
    [89,90,91]. Although the clustering-based FM architecture has promising potential
    to improve energy conservation, network adaptability, and ease of implementation,
    it has not been extensively researched and exploited. Again, distributed FD schemes
    are mainly established on the assumption that the failure of SNs is spatially
    uncorrelated, while event information is spatially correlated. Therefore, the
    FD’s decision framework is frequently modeled using sensory data or statistical
    properties of the spatial or temporally correlated SNs [79,104,105,106] from the
    immediate neighborhood of a node [74,103] or data from farther SNs [107]. To date,
    the applicability of these solutions to the Agri-IoT context has attracted several
    technical challenges. Consequently, the strengths and weaknesses of the main results
    of the benchmarking FM schemes, their underlying assumptions, and how they addressed
    the critical fault-affinity factors such as energy conservation, FT/FA, control
    message complexity, and processor burden of the SNs, are presented in the comparative
    evaluation summary of Table 7. Table 7. Comparative summary of FM schemes for
    WSN-based IoT networks. 6.3. Theories/Concepts of Benchmarking FM Schemes and
    Their Shortcomings The conceptual models/theories of the canon FD decision frameworks
    and the associated shortcomings can be expressed as follows: Statistical approaches
    such as Neyman–Pearson formulation [116], Bayesian statistics [77,103], and normal
    distribution test types (e.g., Thompson Tau statistical test [105]) are high-resource-demanding
    techniques that may apply to classic IoT. Still, they are unsuitable for power-constrained
    Agri-IoT devices or SNs. In addition to being stand-alone and without application
    specificity, these methods operate at high computational and control message complexities.
    Their operational efficiencies increase with increasing data dimensionality and
    also require a priori knowledge of data distribution, which is not possible in
    many real-life applications of Agri-IoT networks. Additionally, they rely on predefined
    thresholds to make local and global FD decisions. Therefore, regardless of the
    extensive research considerations of these methods, they are generally not suitable
    for low-power IoT applications, of which Agri-IoT is no exception. Graph-based
    FM techniques lack precise criteria for outlier detections [83,109], suffer higher
    computational complexities, and also make unrealistic assumptions about the data
    distribution. In addition, these approaches (e.g., De Bruijn graph theory [109]
    and depth-based techniques) are unsuitable for multidimensional and huge datasets.
    Machine learning decision concepts such as the k-out-of-n and majority decision
    rule concepts [93], naive Bayes, iterative algorithms [107], and neural network-based
    techniques, among others, are susceptible to high dimensional datasets, suffer
    high computational cost, and rely on sensitive model parameters. In addition to
    the stipulated shortcomings, these benchmarking FM methods usually ignore the
    sensory data correlation (i.e., attribute correlation, spatial correlation, and
    temporal correlation) properties of SNs, require high communication overhead with
    high FD delays [83], and normally operate in an offline manner, which is inconsistent
    with the modus operandi of typical Agri-IoT. Hence, they are unsuitable for the
    recent low-power Agri-IoT applications. 6.4. Open Issues on Existing FM Solutions
    for Classic WSN-Based IoT Networks and Recommended Design Guidelines for Achieving
    Efficient FM in WSN-Based Agri-IoT A fault in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks
    can be manifested as a data outlier and SN-out-of-service or node failure, both
    of which must be detected and resolved locally or globally using the spatially
    correlated event information and efficient threshold-based decision frameworks.
    Although there has been extensive research concerning FM schemes for the WSN sublayer,
    several technical challenges that require urgent contextual research considerations
    exist. They include the following: Most faults in the PHY layer of Agri-IoT originate
    from the SNs’ power exhaustion, which implies that the best fault-avoidance techniques
    are those that optimize power consumption. However, most FM schemes waste more
    energy and make the network prone to more faults/failures via high control messages
    and computational complexities. Most FM schemes exist as stand-alone frameworks
    without architectural considerations and are founded on unrealistic assumptions,
    which make them difficult to incorporate into existing routing protocols. The
    cluster-based routing architecture is endowed with many untapped local/global
    FM potentials and fault-avoidance capacities for the next-generation Agri-IoT.
    However, these promising potentials have received the least contextualized research
    considerations. Existing FM solutions are meant for resource-sufficient and expensive
    classic WSN-based IoT, not resource-constrained, context-specific use cases like
    Agri-IoT networks. Regarding these technical challenges, this tutorial presents
    the following design guidelines for building efficient and realistic FM schemes
    for WSN-based Agri-IoT: FM schemes must rely on realistic and contextual assumptions
    in order to detect and auto-tolerate sensory data outliers and SN-out-of-service
    faults in real-time routing protocols with minimal message, computational, and
    memory complexities. Such FM schemes will be suitable for all power-constrained
    WSN-based Agri-IoT applications. Future works on FM schemes must be embedded into
    specific routing protocols so that their adaptability to topological dynamism
    and scalability in terms of network sizes and node densities can be assessed in
    an unsupervised manner. Therefore, fault detection and fault-tolerance schemes
    based on simple threshold-based theories are the best candidates for this context,
    since the threshold boundaries of agronomical metrics can be accurately computed
    from the historical data of the location. FM schemes must incorporate redundancy
    check mechanisms by exploiting spatial and temporal correlations among sensory
    data. FM schemes should maintain a good balance between local and global FDs as
    well as a reasonable detection rate and false alarm rate. 7. State of the Art
    on Real-World, Canon WSN-Based Agri-IoT Testbed Solutions It is well documented
    that WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most reliable remedy for mitigating the negative
    impacts climate change has had on agricultural production, for which many architectural
    designs and testbed prototypes have been proposed [12,36]. In addition, since
    the autonomous, resource-constrained SNs in Agri-IoT are expected to operate without
    post-deployment maintenance checks, the issues of FM, power optimization, and
    self-organization during SN design and network deployment cannot be ignored in
    existing testbed solutions [12,117]. Essentially, the results from most research
    projects on Agri-IoT relied on simulation experiments [1,10,14], which have retained
    the gap between the philosophy of this technology and the comprehension of its
    real-world behavior for a more accurate performance assessment. This section presents
    a systematic performance assessment of the few real-world WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed
    solutions currently based on the classic WSN-based IoT principles. To understand
    how the benchmarking realization testbeds of Agri-IoT in [1,10,11,14,18,19] fared
    in real-world operational conditions, the results from their respective performances
    are systematically evaluated and summarized in Table 8. It was discovered that
    the current benchmarking testbed solutions in [1,10,11,14,18,19] are capital-intensive
    because they are reliant on fixed/location-restricted backbone infrastructures
    (see the middle of Figure 3), too complicated to deploy and manage by even expert
    users, based on unrealistic indoor conditions which do not commensurate real-world
    environmental conditions, and based on the high- power-demanding centralized or
    flooding architectures which further complicate network manageability when up-scaled.
    A concise and systematic survey of these benchmarking real-world Agri-IoT networks
    and their flaws in the state of the art is summarized in Table 8. Table 8. Comparative
    analysis of WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions. Additionally, it can be established
    from the comparative assessment of the benchmarking Agri-IoT testbeds in Table
    8 [10,11,18,19] that the embedded communication technology, event routing architecture,
    and the SNs’ power management are the core factors that made them capital-intensive
    and complicated to both experts and low-income farmers. Additionally, self-healing,
    reconfigurability, and adaptability mechanisms to faults were not deployed [1,14,17];
    hence, faulty and turbulent conditions could not be tolerated. Furthermore, since
    the battery-powered SNs rely on expensive Wi-Fi and cellular communication technologies
    that are not freely accessible at all locations, the SNs exhausted their battery
    supply a few days after deployment. Similarly, those that relied on ZigBee/IEEE
    802.15. 4 communication technologies with power-intensive 6LoWPAN or IPv6 protocols
    restricted the resulting network to drive on the problematic centralized or flooding
    architectures without any efficient FM techniques. As a result, these solutions
    used costly fixed IP infrastructural supports and the centralized routing architecture,
    making them practically impossible to manage as the networks scaled. This is why
    the SNs unstably exhausted their battery power and abruptly abridged network lifespans
    [1,10,11,14,18,19]. Therefore, the freely available low-power wireless technologies
    (e.g., LoRa, BLE, 5G, Z-wave, NB-IoT, and SigFox) that are founded on a suitable
    routing topology are the best candidates for making this ubiquitous application
    [1,16] cheap [1,20] and simple for all users. Thus, the cluster-based topology
    is more pivotal to addressing the above challenges of Agri-IoT [10,17] than the
    traditional cellular and WiFi technologies that are inaccessible in many farms,
    depending on their locations [10,20]. However, besides distance-power constraints,
    architectural support, and network manageability challenges, these freely accessible
    wireless communication technologies have specific limitations, which include:
    ZigBee technology achieves the desired power savings only when deployed in star
    or centralized topology [14], and it operates at its low-power distance range
    (10–100 m) in line-of-sight mode depending on the environmental characteristics.
    LoRa is limited to low-density and fixed network sizes (non-scalable), a low data
    rate, and a low message capacity [14]. It may require registration and expensive
    antennae, depending on its operation location. SigFox supports a very low data
    rate and requires registration. LoRa and SigFox possess complex implementations
    because they both require specific modules to function and gateways. WiFi, GPRS,
    cellular technologies, and NB-IoT are high power consumption standards and location-/architecture-restricted.
    BLE has a short communication range but supports clustering architecture, which
    is the most optimal architecture for ensuring the best operational efficiency
    of WSN-based Agri-IoT deployments, since this architecture allows cluster isolation
    and management. Therefore, a research opportunity exists for a flexible, ubiquitous,
    realistic, energy-efficient, self-healing, simple, low-cost, cluster-based, and
    wireless outdoor-based testbed that consists of infrastructure-less, task-scalable,
    and wirelessly configurable experimental SNs and a BS. It should also be deployed,
    re-deployed, monitored, controlled, and managed by non-experts to operate stably
    throughout the entire crop-growing season. 8. Case Study: Cluster-Based Agri-IoT
    (CA-IoT) for Precision Irrigation As earlier established in Figure 2, the design
    and implementation of Agri-IoT networks are driven by unique critical factors,
    which are mainly determined by the associated routing architecture, communication
    technology, actuation management mechanisms, and environmental impacts. In the
    operation phase, these factors constitute the specific objectives in Figure 10,
    which the supervisory routing protocol must address in order to optimize performance
    efficiency and stability. As systematically established above, the LEACH-inherited
    cluster-based architecture has the most promising potential to address these technical
    challenges. It helps to attain high power optimization via communication distance
    and packet minimization, efficient network administration/adaptability, high event
    data quality through auto-FM, and local data quality management, as indicated
    in Figure 10. So, this section presents a systematic analysis of how the merits
    of this architecture evolve in CA-IoT for precision irrigation use cases. Using
    the framework in Figure 12, the cluster-based architecture was pre-examined to
    uncover how the fundamental Agri-IoT design requirements and goals presented in
    the reference frameworks in Figure 2, Figure 9 and Figure 10 can unfold into realistic
    multi-parametric optimization metrics. The conceptual architectural framework
    of the proposed network, as illustrated in Figure 18, can be implemented using
    Arduino-based or Raspberry Pi(RPi)-based microcontrollers, BLE and LoRa for intra-cluster,
    inter-cluster, and BS–cloud communications, respectively, and DHT22/STEMMA soil
    moisture sensors for measuring the respective ambient and soil microclimatic parameters.
    Also, a unit cluster from Figure 18 detailing the key network components of MNs,
    CH, BS, and the field-deployed precision irrigation system is shown in Figure
    19. It is assumed that the core units constituting the MNs, CH, and BS, as illustrated
    in Figure 19, are optimally selected and designed after Figure 2. Using Figure
    18 and Figure 19 as the reference architectural frameworks for achieving our contextualized
    objectives, this section presents an in-depth systematic assessment and characterization
    of the scores of canon cluster-based routing protocols of conventional WSN-based
    IoT applications so that the desired MOO metrics can be appropriately deduced
    and adapted for the design of the associated routing for our case study. Figure

    management. Figure 19. CA-IoT use case cluster illustrating the key network components:
    MNs, CH, and BS. 8.1. Characterization of Canon Clustering-Based Routing Protocols
    and Deduction of MOO Metrics A systematic survey (refer to Table 9) and characterization
    of LEACH-based routing protocols were conducted using the clustering process,
    CH features, and cluster features, as indicated in Figure 20, in order to conceive
    the core MOO metrics for the proposed CA-IoT network framework. The clustering
    process, CH features, and cluster features define the performance optimalities
    and the quality of the sampled data of the resulting architecture. Figure 20.
    Characterization of cluster-based networks and deduced taxonomy of MOO metrics
    for optimizing Agri-IoT networks. Table 9. Comparative summary of Agri-IoT-applicable
    clustering-based routing protocols using characterization parameters. As depicted
    in Figure 20a, the cluster features define the underlying connectivity issues,
    such as cluster quality indices (thus, cluster count, cluster size) and intra-cluster
    and inter-cluster communication types (thus, single-hop or multihop or both) [23,24].
    From the network design viewpoint, the cluster quality depends on the optimality
    of the CH count and cluster sizes, which in turn rely on the core design parameters,
    such as the spatial density and uniformity of the deployed nodes, the specification
    of the wireless communication standard, the routing architecture, and the size
    of the network [47]. Since the deployment of SNs in a typical Agri-IoT can be
    controlled, the stipulated cluster quality properties can be optimized to resolve
    connectivity issues in Figure 20b. In a randomly deployed field, these cluster
    quality parameters can be optimized using a pairing-based SN duty-scheduling mechanisms
    [9,12]. Secondly, the CH features can be static, mobile, or role-rotated in both
    homogeneous or heterogeneous networks [9,12] based on the SNs’ resource hierarchy.
    Additionally, the CHs can be assigned different tasks, such as data aggregation,
    FM, coordinating network reconfiguration or duty cycling, and network maintenance,
    depending on their resource capacities and network requirements. This case study
    is based on static SNs and the distributed network construction approach (see
    references in [9,12,33,126,127,128,129,130,131,132]), where the SNs locally manage
    the entire clustering process, and a CH is elected without the entire network’s
    information. As shown in Figure 20a, the clustering process can be characterized
    by the clustering method/network type (thus, centralized or distributed), the
    CH selection method, reclustering or network adaptability to topological or scalable
    conditions, and the complexities (thus, control message and computational complexities)
    of the entire network operation cycle. Unlike the static approach with fixed CH,
    the adaptive clustering approach selects CH based on the current network conditions
    and rotates this role. However, both approaches can incorporate self-reclustering
    techniques to self-heal SN-out-of-service faults. Data outlier faults can be best
    detected and corrected using threshold-based decision theory or spatial correlation
    methods with the least complexities. Due to the large-scale and high deployment
    densities of WSN-based Agri-IoT, the distributed clustering process is more suitable
    for enhancing local FM, scalability, network management, and power optimization
    than the centralized approaches [37,47]. Generally, the CA-IoT network can be
    optimized by formulating the deduced optimal decision metrics in Figure 20a into
    a MOO framework and multihop routing model in order to provide the guidelines
    for the design of the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. From the comparative evaluations
    of Figure 10 and Figure 20a, a taxonomy of MOO metrics for designing an efficient
    WSN-based CA-IoT network is proposed in Figure 20b. To enhance the clarity of
    the state of the art on cluster-based protocols and justify the need for the proposed
    MOO metrics, a comparative summary based on the characterization parameters is
    presented in Table 9. 8.2. CH Election Techniques A CH selection process is very
    critical to the resulting network’s performance efficiency. In addition to centralized
    networks and the computationally expensive fuzzy-based clustering approaches [133,134],
    the efficiencies of all LEACH-inherited protocols are mainly dependent on their
    CH selection techniques [47,49]. Therefore, the correct estimation of the cluster
    quality metrics (i.e., CHs count and cluster size) is pivotal in attaining the
    objectives in Figure 10. With the aid of nodes’ residual energy and location metrics,
    the optimal CH count and cluster size can be preset before network deployment.
    Currently, these metrics are randomly selected using a probabilistic approach
    in LEACH-inherited protocol [9,21] or derived using a deterministic or an attribute-based
    method [47,135]. However, the probabilistic clustering, such as the LEACH-inherited
    protocols, is expected to perform better in terms of network lifespan, minimal
    clustering overhead, improved connectivity, network/coverage stability, low latency,
    collision-free routing, load balancing, high network stability span, and algorithmic
    simplicity if the optimal CH count was predefined correctly [136]. However, the
    CH count is randomly predefined in these protocols [9,21], which undermines the
    CH’s stability and the resulting architecture’s optimality. This challenge can
    be addressed via common CH selection metrics including Euclidean distance, intra-cluster/inter-cluster
    communication costs, energy-harvesting capacities, and probabilistic factors.
    To date, the related attempts in [49,126,137,138,139] only relied on the SNs’
    residual energy and location information to re-elect CHs after the initial CH
    count is defined, which cannot be ideal for WSN-based Agri-IoT. For instance,
    an active SN in a particular round decides whether or not to become a CH by choosing
    a random number ( 𝑟 𝑛 ) ranging between 0 and 1 and comparing the number with
    a specified threshold 𝑇ℎ . A node, therefore, becomes a CH for that round if 𝑟
    𝑛 <𝑇ℎ , where 𝑇ℎ is expressed as: 𝑇ℎ= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝑝 𝑑 1− 𝑝 𝑑 ×((𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡−𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑)𝑚𝑜𝑑
    1 𝑝 𝑑 , 0, if 𝑛∈𝐺 otherwise (1) where 𝑝 𝑑 is the desired percentage of CHs or
    CH count per round, and G is the number of SNs that have not been a CH in the
    previous 1/𝑝 rounds. The authors in [119] proposed a three-layered LEACH (TL-LEACH)
    that operates in three functional phases—CH election, MN recruitment, and data
    transfer—to enhance the energy efficiency of LEACH. Their first-level CH election
    approach modified Equation (1) into an enhanced threshold 𝑇(𝑖) , which is expressed
    as: 𝑇(𝑖)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨   (𝑟+1)×𝑚𝑜𝑑( 1 𝑝 ×𝑝), 0, if 𝑖∈𝐺 otherwise (2) where p is the
    CH count, r is the current round number, and G is the number of SNs that have
    not been a CH in the previous 1/𝑝 rounds. The second-level CHs are selected from
    the first-level CHs based on the shortest distance to the BS to function as aggregated
    packet forwarders or relay CHs (RCHs). The authors in [120] introduced energy
    ( 𝐸(𝑖) ) and distance ( 𝐷(𝑖) ) attributes into Equation (1) to improve the load-balancing
    merit of LEACH. The resulting 𝑇ℎ is expressed as: 𝑇ℎ= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝑝 𝑑 1− 𝑝 𝑑
    [𝑟×𝑚𝑜𝑑 1 𝑝 𝑑 ] ×[𝐸(𝑖)+(1−𝐷(𝑖))], 0, if 𝑛∈𝐺 otherwise (3) Multihop routing via
    relay CHs (RCHs) was recommended for distant CHs in the future scope of [120].
    In the LEACH presented with a distance-based threshold (LEACH-DT) algorithm in
    [121], the probability of becoming a CH depends on the relative distance between
    a node and the BS. This algorithm differs from the LEACH algorithm because the
    desired percentage of CHs ( 𝑝 𝑖 ) is predefined using Equation (5), while the
    threshold 𝑇(𝐼,𝑟) is expressed as: 𝑇(𝑖,𝑟)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝑝 𝑖 1− 𝑝 𝑖 ×[𝑟×𝑚𝑜𝑑 1 𝑝
    𝑖 ] , 0, if  𝐺 𝑖 (𝑟)=0 if  𝐺 𝑖 (𝑟)=1 (4) Note that the terms retain their usual
    definitions, namely: 𝑝(𝑖)=𝑘 𝜉 𝑖 ∑ 𝑁 𝑗=1 𝜉 𝑗 ,0≤ 𝑝 𝑖 ≤1, (5) where 𝜉 𝑖 =1/ 𝐸 𝐶𝐻
                   × 𝑑 𝑖 − 𝐸 𝑛𝑜𝑛−𝐶𝐻                
                 , (6) The variable 𝑑 𝑖 depicts the distance between
    node i and the BS, and 𝐸 𝐶𝐻 and 𝐸 𝑛𝑜𝑛−𝐶𝐻 are the average residual energies in
    CHs and non-CHs, respectively. The authors further established the need for a
    multihop routing approach in simulations and real-world WSNs to validate the countless
    theoretical propositions and benefits. In the decentralized energy-efficient hierarchical
    cluster-based routing algorithm (DHCR) [123], SNs compete to become CHs. First,
    the BS broadcasts a trigger message at a specific range. The receiving nodes then
    compete to become a CH by disseminating a new message containing their residual
    energies and distances from the BS. Using this information, a neighboring node
    i within the target range receives the message and calculates its 𝐶𝐻 𝑆 𝑛𝑓𝑢 𝑛 𝑖
    as: 𝐶𝐻 𝑆 𝑛𝑓𝑢 𝑛 𝑖 =𝑎× 𝐸𝑟 𝑒 𝑖 𝐸 𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝑏× 1 𝐷𝑖𝑠−𝑇𝑜−𝐵 𝑆 𝑖 , (7) where 𝐸𝑟 𝑒 𝑖 and 𝐸
    𝑚𝑎𝑥 are the residual and initial energy levels of node i, respectively; 𝐷𝑖𝑠−𝑇𝑜−𝐵
    𝑆 𝑖 is the distance between node i and the BS, and a and b are real random values
    between 0 and 1 such that 𝑎+𝑏=1 . The values of 𝐷𝑖𝑠−𝑇𝑜−𝐵 𝑆 𝑖 of node i and its
    neighbors are compared, and the node with the highest 𝐷𝑖𝑠−𝑇𝑜−𝐵 𝑆 𝑖 value is selected
    as the CH. A first-level CH broadcasts its residual energy, neighboring node count,
    and distance from the BS via a specific route. The next-level CHs receive the
    information and similarly repeat the procedure to ensure that every node determines
    a redistributor CH to the BS at the same time. A redistributor CH has more energy
    and fewer neighbors (neighboring degrees). However, the Hamilton energy-efficient
    routing protocol (HEER) [124] creates an entire cluster of nodes, aggregates data,
    and transmits them to the BS via a Hamiltonian path that has been created by the
    entire cluster of nodes and controls the cluster size by selecting one node as
    the CH using the probability function p, which can be expressed as: 𝑝= 𝐿 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒
    𝐹 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (8) where 𝐿 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒 is the size of every node, and 𝐹 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum
    size of a frame. The HEER protocol creates the clusters only once in the first
    round based on LEACH, and it role-rotates the CHs per the energy on the Hamiltonian
    path after a determined period. Similarly, the two-phased EAMR protocol [125]
    randomly preselects the CH. A CH also selects its closest CH as its redistributor
    CH. The clusters are static over the entire network lifetime, and the CH role
    rotates randomly within the clusters according to a cluster replacement threshold.
    The new CH inherits the redistributor role if the old CH had one. Overall, since
    the node location, residual energy, and sleep schedule are indispensable in the
    CH selection process, the CH selection methods proposed by the authors in [9,12,36,120,140]
    are recommended WSN-based Agri-IoT applications. 8.3. Challenges of Existing MOO
    Frameworks and Recommended Future Works As Figure 9 and Figure 10 illustrate,
    the performance efficiency of an infrastructure-less WSN-based Agri-IoT mainly
    depends on the embedded MOO remedies in the associated supervisory routing protocol
    [12]. Several MOO frameworks have been researched since Agri-IoT networks are
    subjected to multiple design and operational constraints. A MOO framework is expected
    to formulate multiple objective functions from a set of MOO metrics to simultaneously
    optimize these multiple objectives, such as the maximal energy savings, highest
    connectivity, best latency, highest reliability, and balanced SN power depletion
    rates across the network. Although the MOO methods are the best candidates for
    Agri-IoT, the existing MOO solutions used in Agri-IoT are adopted from traditional
    WSN-based IoT without any contextual evaluation [12,16,26]. Consequently, they
    have not fulfilled their intended purposes due to several technical challenges,
    including the following: They are limited to non-cluster-based network architectures,
    which implies that the promising potentials of the clustering architecture are
    not adequately exploited [9,12,50,51]. They are frequently implemented in the
    operational phase of the network, which makes it challenging to find global optimal
    solutions with a balanced tradeoff among conflicting objective functions. The
    performance optimality of the Agri-IoT network starts from the SN design. They
    rely on high-resource-demanding algorithms, such as mathematical programming-based
    scalarization methods, multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs), heuristics/metaheuristics-based
    optimization algorithms, and other advanced optimization techniques [23,26,48],
    making them unsuitable for the battery-powered SNs in Agri-IoT. There are no contextual
    MOO guidelines based on Figure 20 to govern the PHY-layer design of Agri-IoT to
    achieve global optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among conflicting objectives.
    Consequently, there are conflicting scenarios in existing MOO solutions [50].
    Therefore, there is an urgent demand for a realistic low-power MOO framework for
    CA-IoT networks that is founded on the core WSN design metrics and MOO taxonomy
    metrics in Figure 10 and the top of Figure 20, respectively. The following section
    assesses how evaluations and deductions evolve in a typical event sampling and
    routing protocol in a CA-IoT network for precision irrigation system management.
    9. Design of WSN-Specific CA-IoT Routing Protocol This section proposes a CA-IoT-based
    supervisory routing protocol that supports static SNs, rotatable/fixed CH roles,
    and enhanced SN resource management under the deterministic deployment approach.
    This can improve energy savings, connectivity, distance moderation, and multihop
    inter-cluster communication in the resulting network. The operational cycle and
    the embedded activities of our WSN-based CA-IoT protocol for precision irrigation
    application, as illustrated in Figure 21, include the following: Figure 21. Proposed
    operation cycle for designing our CA-IoT network’s routing protocol. Network Construction
    or Setup Phase: This phase involves network modeling, CH election, and cluster
    formation, which is explained in Figure 21. The active–sleep duty-cycle scheduling
    ensures the SNs only switch to active mode during their scheduled sampling durations.
    In randomly deployed WSNs, redundant event reporting can be avoided using a correlated
    pairing-based active–sleep duty-cycle scheduling approach in [12]. The optimal
    CH count and cluster size must be predefined from the resource capacities of the
    SNs. After the initial CH election, the MNs are recruited and assigned their respective
    sampling and intra-cluster communication timeslots. Sampling, Data Management,
    and Transmission Phase: The tasks executed in this phase include event sampling,
    intra-cluster and inter-cluster data transmissions, data outlier FM, and event
    data redundancy management. Since microclimatic soil parameters do not change
    swiftly [1,14], sampling can only be scheduled during the day at 3-hourly time
    intervals. In addition to power optimization, the clustering approach provides
    superb potential for both local and global FM using threshold-based FM theory
    and spatial correlation techniques. Based on the architecture in Figure 19 and
    the resource limitations of the SNs, it is recommended that the communication
    beyond the BS or gateway can utilize LoRa or Wi-Fi AirBox, whereas the intra-cluster
    and inter-cluster communications must be the freely available low-power BLE technology,
    since it is the most suitable for the clustering architecture. Network Maintenance
    and Reclustering Phase: This phase resolves all unforeseen topological dynamics
    caused by the SNs’ failures, network scalability, node mobility, and unexpected
    operational flaws, without interfering with the normal network functionality via
    adaptive reclustering, self-healing, and multihop routing techniques [12,23,24].
    Here, a parent CH coordinates the election of child CHs (CCHs). While all non-CCHs
    switch to sleep mode, the CCHs recruit new MNs using location and residual energy
    parameters, assign them their respective sampling timeslots, and repeat Phase
    2 afterward, as shown in Figure 21. SN-out-of-service faults are auto-detected
    and tolerated in this phase. Additionally, Figure 21 uniquely incorporates correlated
    pairing-based duty cycling, constant control message complexity FM/data redundancy
    scheme, network construction/maintenance, and cluster quality measures that can
    ensure unprecedented energy savings and event data quality. This clustering approach
    can further minimize energy wastage via a suitable MAC method, a low-power wireless
    communication standard, data aggregation with data redundancy checks, and CH role
    rotation, among other factors. Although the various sections of the deduced MOO
    metrics have been implemented in our CA-IoT operational cycle, the most desired
    performance can be optimally attained when the MOO metrics are modeled into their
    respective objective functions, and their optimal values are determined and implemented
    in both simulation and testbed experiments in future works. Also, a realistic
    multihop routing framework can also be inculcated into this protocol for large-scale
    applications. 10. Open Issues and Future Works: Cluster-Based WSN-Specific Agri-IoT
    Networks This tutorial has firmly established that the WSN-based Agri-IoT is an
    indispensable component of smart or precision farming and greenhouses, despite
    its resource- and deployment-induced challenges [12,26,141]. Unlike the conventional
    IoT, Agri-IoT is compelled to drive on batteries and affordable task-scalable
    SNs. However, it must meet the expectations in Figure 2 to guarantee a stable
    performance. The cluster-based routing technique has emerged with promising potential
    to mitigate these challenges. However, results from existing testbed solutions
    in this study show otherwise due to the absence of a contextualized in-depth overview
    of Agri-IoT as well as the following open issues which have not received extensive
    contextual research considerations in Agri-IoT applications: The cluster-based
    routing architecture for WSN-based Agri-IoT has not received holistic and practical
    research considerations as far as FM, power optimization, and network adaptability
    are concerned. Therefore, there is a demand for multi-parametric optimization
    frameworks and guidelines for designing and implementing the WSN sublayer. Concerning
    FM, most proposed schemes in the canon state of the art are stand-alone, have
    high control message and computational complexities (energy-inefficient), and
    are mostly incompatible with the clustering architecture [25,52]. The desired
    FM schemes for CA-IoT applications should be equipped with fault-avoidance mechanisms
    and the capacity to detect and self-heal root faults (SN-out-of-service and sensory
    data outliers [25]), not their effects. Multihop routing, which is a requirement
    to attain the desired energy savings and network adaptability in large-scale CA-IoT
    networks, is asserted to be more energy-efficient only in simulation experiments
    [33,120,121,123,124,125,128,129,130] but not in real-world implementation [22,23,24].
    This imbalance is due to a lack of a comprehensive and reliable theoretical multihop
    routing framework that is based on the total communication costs of multihop routing.
    There is a demand for a more realistic and holistic MOO framework that can optimize
    the operational efficiency metrics such as cluster size, cluster counts, density/uniformity
    of nodes, communication distance, and activity schedule/duration, right from the
    network design phase to the operational phase of Agri-IoT networks. Although the
    current literature supports adaptive clustering with CH role rotation ideology,
    there exists the need for an optimal initial CH-count estimator in order to improve
    the stability of CH elections and the architecture. Thus, the cluster quality
    indices (e.g., optimal cluster count and size) must be predetermined before defining
    them in the associated CH election method, since CH stability is compromised in
    most clustering methods [9,21,119,120,121,123,124]. Most protocols in the state
    of the art rely on perfect homogeneous networks, which is unrealistic due to variations
    in modular specifications and resource utilization and the fact that different
    SNs may have different communication and data computational roles. Therefore,
    a more realistic, contextualized, and adaptive clustering approach that leverages
    the gap between the philosophy and practice of Agri-IoT applications is needed.
    In addition to the parent LEACH protocol [21,61] which is a complete suite application
    comprising routing, MAC, and physical characteristics for wireless communication
    in WSNs, most benchmarking MAC protocols purposed for traditional IoT applications
    are shelved, since they are developed in solitude without application specificity
    and network architectural considerations. A custom-built and holistic protocol
    suite for Agri-IoT remains a research opportunity. 11. Conclusion and Future Works
    This tutorial presented: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts,
    technologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT; (2) an evaluation
    of the technical design requirements of a robust, ubiquitous, self-healing, energy-efficient,
    adaptive, and affordable Agri-IoT; (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking
    FM techniques, communication standards, routing protocols, MMAC protocols, and
    WSN-based testbed solutions; and (4) an in-depth case study on how to design a
    self-healing, energy-efficient, affordable, adaptive, stable, and cluster-based
    WSN-specific Agri-IoT from a proposed taxonomy of MOO metrics that can guarantee
    optimized network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new taxonomies
    of faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for CA-IoT networks. Using the
    open technical issues, it recommended application-specific requirements of Agri-IoT,
    general design expectations, and remedial measures, and it evaluated them in CA-IoT
    for precision irrigation in order to optimally exploit the proposed MOO metrics
    in a typical CA-IoT design in both simulation and real-world deployment scenarios.
    Overall, this tutorial can serve as a new reference document for the IoT community
    and Agri-IoT designers, since it adequately examined all critical aspects of WSN-based
    Agri-IoT networks from theoretical modeling to real-world implementation. Author

  description: Food security and sustainable development is making a mandatory move
    in the entire human race. The attainment of this goal requires man to strive for
    a highly advanced state in the field of agriculture so that he can produce crops
    with a minimum amount of water and fertilizer. Even though our agricultural methodol-ogies
    have undergone a series of metamorphoses in the process of a present smart-agricultural
    system, a long way is ahead to attain a system that is precise and accurate for
    the optimum yield and profitability. Towards such a futuristic method of cultivation,
    this paper proposes a novel method for monitoring the efficient flow of a small
    quantity of water through the conventional irrigation system in cultivation using
    Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks (CWSN). The performance measure is simulated
    the creation of edge-fixed geodetic clusters using Mat lab’s Cup-carbon tool in
    order to evaluate the suggested irrigation process model’s performance. The findings
    of blocks 1 and 2 are assessed. Each signal takes just a little amount of energy
    to communicate, according to the performance. It is feasible to save energy while
    maintaining uninterrupted communication between nodes and cluster chiefs. However,
    the need for proper placement of a dynamic control station in WSN still exists
    for maintaining connectivity and for improving the lifetime fault tolerance of
    WSN. Based on the minimum edge fixed geodetic sets of the connected graph, this
    paper offers an innovative method for optimizing the placement of control stations.
    The edge-fixed geodetic cluster makes the network fast, efficient and reliable.
    Moreover, it also solves routing and congestion problems.

    is making a mandatory move in the entire human race. The attainment of this goal
    requires man to strive for a highly advanced state in the field of agriculture
    so that he can produce crops with a minimum amount of water and fertilizer. Even
    though our agricultural methodologies have undergone a series of metamorphoses

    Towards such a futuristic method of cultivation, this paper proposes a novel method
    for monitoring the efficient flow of a small quantity of water through the conventional

    back-steppingFASTTime delay estimation 1. Introduction With the ever-increasing
    energy demand and growing concern for environmental issues, sustainable solutions
    have attracted tremendous attention, among which wind energy has demonstrated
    outstanding characteristics, such as availability and low cost [1]. By the end
    of 2019, the total capacity for wind energy globally has reached over 651 GW,
    indicating a 10% increase compared to 2018 [2]. Wind turbines, as the main wind
    energy conversion system, have a complex and nonlinear dynamics, and work under
    stochastic wind disturbances, and centrifugal, gravitational and gyroscopic loads
    [3]. Relying on several rotating and non-rotating components and sensors, in addition
    to working in harsh environments make them prone to faults and failures, leading
    to low reliability. To prevent unpredicted failures, maintenance schedules are
    planned, which not only increase cost, but also reduce the power generation due
    to required downtime [4]. These challenges have been the motivation behind numerous
    researches in the realm of wind turbines, from nominal control to fault detection,
    isolation, and fault-tolerant control. Among the wind turbine subsystems, pitch
    control system plays a pivotal role in its performance by adjusting the power
    output, limiting power capture under high wind, mitigating operational load, stalling,
    and aerodynamic braking [5]. The pitch actuator faults are mostly due to pressure
    drop in hydraulic system or high air content in the oil, as a result of which
    the actuators’ dynamics slow down. This deteriorates the pitching performance
    and can cause fluctuations on generator speed and power and also loss of turbine
    stability [6]. Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI), and Fault-Tolerant Control
    (FTC) are effective methods that improve reliability, lower the maintenance cost,
    reduce downtime, prevent catastrophic failures, and yet despite the presence of
    faults, preserve system performance at the desired level. FTC approaches are generally
    categorized into two groups, Passive (PFTC) and Active (AFTC). PFTC schemes have
    fixed control structures, designed to be robust against uncertainties and faults,
    while AFTC approaches use the fault information from Fault Detection (FD) unit
    and reconfigure or redesign the controller, accordingly; so that acceptable performance
    and stability of the system can be retained. Not relying on fault detection, the
    PFTC approaches demonstrate fast response, but limited robustness. FDI techniques
    are performed with two approaches: model-based or signal processing methods. The
    latter approach requires the access to a huge bank of historical data with full
    fault scenarios, used as the input of diagnosis system. The model-based FDI are
    conducted based on a variety of methods including Sliding Mode Observer (SMO)
    [7], Kalman filters [8,9], intelligent techniques like fuzzy or neural network
    modeling and identification methods, as well as time delay estimation (TDE). Intelligent
    techniques suffer from high computational cost and difficult implementation, and
    SMO method requires the pre-knowledge about bounds of faults which in most practical
    cases are not known. Time delay estimation is a simple, model-free, yet robust
    approach which can be effectively applied for fault detection [10]. Simple design,
    high robustness against disturbances and uncertainties, insensitivity to parameter
    variation, as well as the ability to tackle faults have made the Sliding Mode
    Control (SMC)-based FTC methods an attractive control option for wind turbines.
    Nevertheless, the conventional SMC suffers from chattering and infinite time convergence
    to equilibrium point. Chattering can cause actuators to overheat, excite high
    frequency oscillations, and result in high wear of moving mechanical components.
    A variety of methods have been proposed to address these problems. To ameliorate
    chattering High Order SMC (HOSM) techniques and also Fractional Order (FO) SMC
    [11] are applied. The convergence rate drawback of SMC is addressed by proposing
    Terminal Sliding Mode Control (TSMC) scheme [12]. However, it suffers from two
    drawbacks: i) low convergence rate when the system state is far away from the
    equilibrium point. ii) Singularity problem. These problems were solved in Fast
    Terminal SMC (FTSMC) [13] and Nonsingular Terminal SMC (NTSMC) [14]. Besides chattering
    reduction, fractional calculus can enhance accuracy [15,16]. Compared to integer
    order controllers, fractional order ones are more robust, and also more stable,
    since they take the stationary error and the overshoot percentage into account
    [17]. Recently, many authors have integrated fractional calculus with SMC in order
    to improve its performance [18,19]. In Ref. [18], fractional order SMC strategy
    was proposed for a permanent magnet synchronous motor. Another fractional order
    SMC was developed in Ref. [19] to enhance the performance of anti-lock braking
    system. Furthermore, a fractional-order PI controller was developed to control
    a variable-speed wind turbine [20]. This approach has also been employed to enhance
    the robustness of AFTC. In Ref. [9] an AFTC based on fractional-order TSMC was
    designed and its estimation accuracy was enhanced using virtual actuators. Back-Stepping
    (BS) is another control approach that has been widely applied to control nonlinear
    systems. Owing to its systematic and recursive nature, back-stepping scheme is
    flexible in designing controllers for high-order nonlinear systems. Despite the
    shortcomings of the conventional version, such as sluggish motion and slow convergence,
    it can improve transient system performance [21]. Chakravarty [22] showed that
    by integrating back-stepping with second-order SMC, the post-fault transient performance
    of the AFTC improves, without sacrificing the control energy. Recently, the application
    of FTC in pitch control of wind turbines has grown increasingly. A fault diagnosis
    and fault tolerant control strategy for pitch actuator in wind turbines was proposed
    in Ref. [23]. They designed their controller by combining a disturbance compensator
    with a controller which is formulated in the discrete time domain, while the performance
    of the proposed controller was validated in FAST simulator. In Ref. [24], model
    predictive FTC is presented for wind turbines in partial-load region in the presence
    of uncertainties, disturbances and actuator/sensor faults. The authors, used a
    robust LMI-based adaptive method in order to estimate sensor faults, while a robust
    passive FTC is considered to reconstruct actuator faults. An observer-based FTC
    method was developed for the pitch system of wind turbine being under actuator
    and sensor faults [25]. A sliding mode approach and a proportional-integral observer
    were used in their study to track the blade pitch. Stability analysis was performed
    using linear matrix inequality (LMI) and Lyapunov method. An adaptive AFTC strategy
    is designed for wind power generation that ensures a smooth and robust control
    process in both normal and faulty conditions of actuator [26]. Moreover, an AFTC
    method entailing the robust estimation and compensation for wind turbine actuator
    and sensor faults was introduced in Ref. [27]. Their proposed control method comprised
    two parts: An active disturbance rejection control method, and a descriptor SMO.
    To validate the results, the controller was implemented in FAST environment. This
    paper proposes a new AFTC using adaptive fractional-based Terminal Back-stepping
    Sliding Mode (TBSM) control scheme with nonsingular integral properties for pitch
    angle control of a wind turbine in the presence of sensor and actuator faults.
    Integrating BS, SMC, and FO control approaches ensures high robustness, improves
    post-fault transient performance and gives higher degrees of freedom. For stability
    analysis, Lyapunov theory is applied and the effectiveness of the proposed controller
    is studied by its implementation on a detailed aero-elastic wind turbine simulator
    (FAST) designed by NREL National Wind Technology Center. Moreover, the wind profiles
    are generated using TurbSim. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes
    the problem and preliminaries by defining the wind turbine model, introducing
    the system faults that will be considered in this study and giving the preliminaries
    and notations required for controller design. The proposed Passive FTC is described
    in section 3 and the Active FTC is presented in section 4. Simulation results
    are reported in section 5 and the conclusion is drawn in section 6. 2. Problem

    comprises three main components, namely rotor blades, gear box and generator.

    time profile, faults are categorized into incipient or abrupt types. Incipient
    faults occur slowly and grow gradually, while abrupt faults happen suddenly and
    unexpectedly. In spite of the fact that the abrupt faults are mostly easy to detect,
    they have the potential to impose severe effects on the system [30]. From severity
    point of view, faults can be divided into extreme or non-extreme. For extreme
    faults, immediate actions like off-grid procedures or shutdown are taken. On the
    other hand, for non-extreme cases, FTC strategies can be applied to maintain the
    turbine performance at an acceptable level [31]. Studies reveal that a great portion
    of failures are minor, and also the most prevalent failure occurs in pitch/hydraulic
    system [32]. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the hydraulic pitch system mainly comprises
    a pump, some valves, and a blade pitch motion mechanism. A controller takes the
    error signal between the actual and reference rotor speed and transmits the control
    signal to a servo valve that controls the actuator position. Pitch system fault
    has various causes, whether in control, or in hydraulic subsystem. Sensor faults
    occur in control subsystem, while pump wear, hydraulic leakage, and high air content
    in the oil affect the hydraulic subsystem. Download : Download high-res image

    blade pitch system. Pitch sensor bias and gain degrades the performance of the
    controller, so that the system is unable to follow the desired input. In extreme
    cases when the pitch sensor completely fails, the blades are feathered. Bias in
    generator speed sensor also causes the pitch angle to deviate from its desired
    value, or the actuator experience runaway. High air content in oil can lead to
    slow pitch control action causing fluctuations in generator speed and power, and
    loss of system stability [7]. Moreover, incorrect pitch angle generates asymmetrical
    forces on the blades and intensifies structural loading of its platform. Hydraulic
    leakage can be divided into external and internal. External leakage happens at
    either side of the actuator, but the internal one takes place between the two
    hydraulic cylinder chambers. High internal leakage causes the actuator lose its
    ability to apply effective load, and external leakage may lead to a sluggish response
    [33]. 2.2.1. Pitch sensor fault The bias fault is prevalent in wind turbines and
    can be introduce to the system as a result of pitch sensor malfunction or inaccurate
    system calibration. Sensor fault is categorized as incipient and can be distinguished
    from the rate of biased signal and its range [28]. Biased output deteriorates
    the closed-loop system performance, and affects the pitch angle measurement. In
    the presence of bias fault, the dynamic model of the pitch actuator, Eq. (6),
    changes to the following equation. (10) in which subscripts , , and stand for
    bias, reference, and delay. The measured signal is written as, (11) where is measurement
    noise. 2.2.2. Pitch actuator faults The main faults of the hydraulic pitch actuators
    are: pump wear, hydraulic leakage and high air content in the oil. These faults
    affect the system dynamics differently and their influence is reflected in natural
    frequency ( ) and damping ratio ( ) of the pitch system. The numerical values
    of the actuator dynamic parameters for the reference wind turbine model, are summarized
    in Table 2. Table 2. Various faults effect on pitch system dynamics [28]. Faults
    Notes No fault (fault free) 11.11 0.6 • nominal value of the air content in the
    oil: 7%. High air content in the oil 5.73 0.45 • an incipient fault • a reversible
    process (the air content in the oil may disappear without any necessary repair)
    • air content in the oil:15%. Pump wear 7.27 0.75 • irreversible • slow process
    • up to 75% pressure drop Hydraulic leakage/Pressure drop 3.42 0.9 • an incipient
    fault • irreversible • faster than the pump wear • pressure drop for too fast
    leakage • up to 50% pressure drop • Under too low hydraulic pressure the system
    is unable to move the blades and therefore, the actuator sticks in its current
    position resulting in blade seize. 2.2.2.1. Pump wear As an incipient fault, pump
    wear happens at slow rate and causes low pump pressure. It changes the dynamics
    of pitch system as follows. (12) where shows the level of wear. Zero value indicates
    the normal condition, while its upper bound corresponds to 75% pump pressure.
    2.2.2.2. Hydraulic leakage Hydraulic leakage is also an incipient fault, but happens
    faster than pump wear. This fault varies the system parameter as follows. (13)
    where . In normal operation, , and when the hydraulic pressure experiences 50%
    loss, . 2.2.2.3. High air content in oil High air content in oil is another incipient
    fault, whose effect on the system is described as below. (14) Unlike the previously
    mentioned faults, high air content in oil can disappear. So, can take negative
    values, too. Zero and one values for show 7% and 15% air content, respectively.
    If the hydraulic leakage persists, the pitch actuators may become uncontrollable.
    To prevent this situation, it should be detected before the hydraulic pressure
    drops to 50% of its nominal value. In addition, to accommodate this type of fault,
    the wind turbine needs a shut down before it completely loses its controllability.
    Other types of faults, namely pump wear and high air content in oil, are accommodated
    in similar manner, and they can be addressed by FTC methods [28]. 2.3. Preliminaries
    of fractional calculus In this section, the fundamental definitions of fractional
    order calculus and some of its key properties are presented, which are necessary
    for the controller design. Definition 1 The fractional integral with fractional
    order of function is defined as [34]: (15) where is the Gamma function and is
    the initial time. Definition 2 The Reimann-Liouville fractional derivative of
    αth-order of function is defined as follows [34]: (16) Property 1 The Reimann-Liouville
    fractional derivative operator commutes with (17) Theorem 1 Let be an equilibrium
    point for the following non-autonomous fractional-order system. (18) Assume that
    there exists a Lyapunov function and class-K functions (i = 1, 2, 3) satisfying
    [35]: (19) where . Then, the system is asymptotically stable [36]. Lemma 1 Assume
    that a continuous positive-definite function satisfies the differential Inequality
    [37]. (20) 3. PFTC based on a novel TBSM This section deals with passive fault-tolerant
    control design based on a novel TBSM approach for pitch angle control of a wind
    turbine in the presence of faults. 3.1. Fractional order-based Terminal Back-Stepping
    sliding mode controller with nonsingular property To guarantee the robustness
    of the controller in the presence of external disturbances and uncertainties,
    a control scheme has been proposed by combining back-stepping, sliding mode, and
    fractional order calculus. The tracking error of rotor speed is defined as, (21)
    where is the rated rotor speed. Taking time derivative of Eq. (21) yields the
    rotor speed dynamics as, (22) It can be proved that there exists a diffeomorphism
    transformation so that the wind turbine system given in Eq. (9) is equivalent
    to the system in its normal form with stable zero dynamics. This means that, taking
    time derivative of guarantees that the wind turbine system is stable and non-singular
    over its entire operating points [38,39]. Thus, the second-order derivative of
    results in, (23) where and represent the effects of faults and uncertainties,
    and , are [29]: (24) Now, a virtual control law is defined as, (25) where is a
    constant. is defined as, (26) Stability of under the virtual control law is analyzed
    by considering the following positive-definite Lyapunov function, . (27) Time
    derivative of after substituting Eqs. (22), (25), and (26) is obtained as, (28)
    Based on SMC theory, the following fractional order sliding manifold is proposed.
    (29) where and are constant parameters. For the controller to have nonsingular
    property, it is required that , and are chosen odd integers satisfying . The time
    derivative of the sliding surface is written as, (30) Now, if is calculated by
    taking time derivative of Eq. (26) and is replaced in Eq. (30), the following
    equation is obtained. (31) and taking Eq. (23) into account, it is rewritten as,
    (32) The next step is to design reaching mode control scheme using a reaching
    control law . This can be derived as follows: ‌ (33) It should be noted that is
    non-singular for all operating points [29]. The fractional order term in control
    signal, , enhances the controller robustness. Applying fractional order calculus
    to SMC gives an extra degree of freedom compared to integer order SMC, thus better
    control performance is achieved. Using Lemma 1, the stability of wind turbine
    system with fractional TBSM is proved. Finally, the TBSM-based control law is
    obtained as, (34) where , and are positive scalars and are optimized using Harmony
    Search Algorithm (HSA) [40]. Theorem 2 By applying the proposed structure defined
    by Eq. (34), the wind turbine system is stable and the rotor speed converges to
    the fractional sliding manifold. Proof: Stability analysis of the proposed controller
    is conducted based on SMC theory, and to do so, a positive definite Lyapunov function
    is chosen as follows: (35) Taking time derivative of this equation results in,
    (36) which can be expanded by substituting Eqs. (28) and (32) as, (37) Substituting
    the control law from Eq. (34) leads to, (38) which after simplification can be
    written in the following form. (39) To prove the stability of a system according
    to Lyapunov theory, time derivative of the chosen positive definite Lyapunov function
    must be negative definite. From Eq. (39) it is evident that all terms are negative
    except the first term, , which does not have a specific sign. To prove the negative
    definite property of and asymptotical stability of the system under the control
    law, Eq. (34), positive definite matrix rules are used. Substituting the proposed
    fractional sliding surface, Eq. (29), into Eq. (39) results in: (40) By defining
    and so that , the following inequality holds. (41) Taking the following positive
    upper bound of each term into account, (42) If the constant parameters satisfy
    above condition, will be positive definite and then in Eq. (41) will be negative
    definite. As mentioned in Ref. [41], and are also negative definite and and are
    positive constants. Therefore, according to Lyapunov stability theory, the wind
    turbine system will be stable. Theorem 1 proved that rotor speed reaches the proposed
    fractional sliding surface, while the convergence of fractional sliding surface
    is not discussed. In Theorem 2, the convergence of fractional sliding surface
    is investigated. The new generalized Lyapunov stability theory and Lemmas proposed
    in Ref. [36] are used to investigate the convergence of sliding manifold defined
    in Eq. (29). 4. AFTC on the basis of TDE and adaptive fractional TBSM Previous
    section was devoted to designing a PFTC scheme which does not rely on fault information.
    The influence of fault on the wind turbine system is considered as the effect
    of uncertainty, and no FD system is required. In spite of the fact that its independence
    from FD information increases its response speed, it needs to be able to address
    a wide range of faults. For this reason, its sliding gain should be chosen bigger
    than the upper bound of faults. This guarantees the stability and convergence
    of the tracking error, and overcomes some limitations such as unavailability of
    bounds of faults in practical applications. However, large sliding gain can potentially
    intensify the controller chattering. To overcome the drawbacks of the previous
    PFTC controller, in this section, an AFTC based on TDE and adaptive fractional
    TBSM is presented. FD system entails a TDE for detecting, isolating and approximating
    the unknown uncertainties and faults. Then, the information of the FD system is
    used to reconfigure the control system. 4.1. Adaptive control law In practice,
    wind turbines are often subjected to harsh environment with highly turbulent wind
    fields. There are large fluctuations in aerodynamic forces and moments, which
    may lead to unexpected failures of turbine components if not handled properly.
    Performance of the control system highly depends on reliability of the plant model.
    In wind turbines, nevertheless, the system parameters are usually not completely
    known due to inherent nonlinearities of the model, unmolded modes, manufacturing
    and assembling tolerances, and external operating uncertainties. Adaptive control
    approach is a promising solution which makes the system capable of dealing with
    various uncertainties by online updating parameters so that the error between
    the reference and plant output forces get close to zero [42]. Thus, the adaptation
    law is proposed as follows: (43) Theorem 3 Considering the adaptive control law,
    Eq. (43), the wind turbine system with the proposed control law is stable and
    its rotor speed tends to its rated value. Proof: A positive definite Lyapunov
    function is chosen as: (44) where and are the estimation error of control parameters.
    Time derivative of is obtained as, (45) Substituting Eq. (28) and Eq. (32) into
    Eq. (45) yields, (46) If the control law, Eq. (43), is substituted in Eq. (46),
    will be as follows. (47) After some simplifications and eliminations, Eq. (47)
    becomes, (48) Based on the descriptions mentioned about the sign of , it can be
    inferred that is negative definite. Thus, the wind turbine system is stable and
    the rotor speed converges to its desired value when the adaptive control law,
    Eq. (43), is applied. 4.2. Fault diagnosis using TDE Abrupt faults such as hydraulic
    leakage grow fast and eventually make the system uncontrollable. Thus, a mere
    parameter estimation for the pitch system does not suffice and the fault needs
    to be detected such that the wind turbine can be shut down while the pitch system
    is still controllable. Moreover, AFTC relies on fault detection to compensate
    for the effect of faults. Therefore, for incipient faults that can be accommodated
    through AFTC schemes, fault detection is of high importance. In this section a
    fault detection scheme is designed to distinguish faults based on parameter estimation.
    For sufficiently small time delay value, uncertainty and fault, and , can be regarded
    as continuous or piecewise continuous functions with the following approximation.
    (49) Therefore, the approximation for and are considered as, (50) By adding these
    two approximate functions and replacing their equivalent values from Eq. (49)
    the following TDE is obtained. (51) This TDE acts as a robust FD observer, which
    can effectively detect and isolate the actuator faults in the presence of uncertainties.
    It is noteworthy that the FD system not only must be sensitive against any type
    of fault, but also must be robust against uncertainties. To ensure this property,
    a threshold should be chosen, so that when then , and (52) This implies that system
    is in normal condition and the residual is always smaller than . Properly choosing
    guarantees the robustness of FD system. It should be noted that when the residual
    overshoots its corresponding threshold, the fault is detected and isolated. 4.3.
    AFTC design In this part, an AFTC is proposed based on adaptive fractional order
    TBSM and TDE. It is assumed that the uncertainties and actuator faults can be
    lumped in the following form. (53) where is the TDE error. So, Eq. (23) can be
    rewritten as, (54) where represents the effect of TDE on rotor speed dynamics.
    Assumption 1 the TDE error has an upper bound, , which seems to be realistic if
    is sufficiently small. The derivative of sliding surface, Eq. (32), is rewritten
    as: (55) Then, control law on the basis of time delay control and fractional back-stepping
    terminal sliding mode is: (56) where is a positive constant. 4.4. Stability analysis
    To prove the stability of the AFTC, the following positive definite Lyapunov function
    is considered. (57) Time derivative of Eq. (57) after substituting the control
    law from Eq. (43), and simplification is obtained as, (58) Introducing sliding
    surface into Eq. (58) yields, (59) Optimal control gains are derived applying
    Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA). The objective function of this optimization is
    chosen as the sum of integral time absolute error (ITAE) of rotor speed and control
    input rate. For more conformity with reality and to improve optimization procedure,
    HSA has been linked to FAST and then, optimal parameters are obtained as presented
    in Table 3. Block diagram of the proposed AFTC is shown in Fig. 4. (60) Table

    of the proposed AFTC. Sign function is a strong switcher and causes undesirable
    chattering, which is the fundamental flaw of the conventional sliding mode controller
    from which both the proposed PFTC and AFTC suffer. Its detrimental effects on
    the performance of the controller can be overcome by eliminating it through two
    ways. The first one is to use a continuous function such as which at the same
    time can cause inaccuracy and detract the robustness of the controller. Second,
    the best and most efficient approach is to apply supper-twisting sliding mode
    algorithm which not only eliminates the chattering but also can enhance the accuracy.
    Hence, the reaching control law is modified as follows [43]: (61) where, (62)
    The complete stability of the STW algorithm is presented in Ref. [43]. 4.5. Extended-order
    states and perturbation observer To estimate the time varying nonlinearities and
    uncertainties, an extended-order observer is designed. It is assumed that both
    nonlinear terms in Eq. (9) are unknown, then the lumped term comprising all nonlinearities,
    disturbances, uncertainties and faults is considered as follows: (63) where is
    the nominal constant gain which is chosen as the mean value of . Then, the system
    dynamics, Eq. (23), is rewritten as: (64) By defining and and a state variable
    the mathematical model of the extended order observer is written as follows: (65)
    By defining , the nonlinear observer is introduced as: (66) where , and are the
    estimated value of , observer gain and input error of the nonlinear function;
    is the precision index, and represents the width of the linear area of a nonlinear
    function. Remark 1 This observer guarantees the finite time error convergence
    regardless of the control law, which means that the observer and the controller
    can be designed individually. Remark 2 Fault estimation also can be determined
    from the following equality: (67) It should be noted that in order to detect and
    isolate the actuator faults, this fault estimation can be taken into account.
    Remark 3 In general, PFTC offers fast response compared to AFTC, since it does
    not rely on fault detection process. However, the proposed AFTC can potentially
    compensate the fault impact without any delay, which is achieved by the robust
    FD system, capable of reducing the time delay between the fault occurrence and
    accommodation. Remark 4 TDE algorithm in this paper can compensate not only the
    uncertainties in healthy and normal conditions, but also the influence of both
    uncertainties and faults in faulty conditions. Remark 5 Besides chattering of
    control signals, in practice the sensor signals are also inextricably intertwined
    with noise. To eliminate both of these effects, extended-order states and perturbation
    observer is applied as an effective choice. 5. Simulation results In this section,
    a set of simulations are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed
    controller for both healthy and faulty operating conditions. The controller is
    designed based on the two-mass model of the wind turbine and is validated on a
    sophisticated model in FAST simulator. As states in FAST user guide, the pitch
    actuator dynamics are not included in this model, which means that the blades
    can follow the reference pitch angle without any time delay. To compensate for
    this paucity, an additional actuator dynamic block is added to the existing model.
    For the sake of brevity, exclusively the results of FAST simulation are presented
    in this paper. Through Turbsim, six wind speed profiles with 15, 18, and 21 m/s
    mean speed and 5% and 15% turbulence intensity for each case was generated and
    separately applied to the model. For the most of the simulations, except for the
    ones with stated wind profiles, the case of 18 m/s mean speed and 15% turbulence
    intensity is used and also . Faulty condition is simulated with three different
    faults, including hydraulic leakage, high air content in the oil, and pump wear.
    To emulate measurement noise, a Gaussian noise with zero mean and given standard
    deviation is added to the output. Depending on the sensor type and measurement
    difficulty, the standard deviation of noise varies. The applied standard deviation
    for the noise of different sensors is presented in Table 4. Table 4. Standard
    deviation of sensor noise [28]. Fault Standard Deviation generator speed 0:0158
    rad/s generator torque 45 Nm pitch angle 0:2 deg In order to get a better overview
    of the overall performance of the proposed controller, two other FTC-based controllers,
    namely, feedback linearization (FL) and sliding mode control (SMC), are also designed
    and implemented for comparison. To evaluate the robustness of the controller and
    the accuracy of perturbation estimation, the simulated and estimated state values
    for both healthy and faulty conditions in the presence of turbulent wind fields
    are presented in Fig. 5. The results for rotor speed and its corresponding estimation
    error are depicted in Fig. 5.a and b, which clearly show the close compliance
    of the results and confirm the effectiveness of the estimation method. Furthermore,
    it is noteworthy that under the influence of wind disturbance and measurement
    noise, and even after the occurrence of faults, the rotor speed remains bounded,
    proving the robust property of the proposed control scheme. Perturbation estimation
    also demonstrates a good agreement with simulated signal, as depicted in Fig.
    5.c. Pitch angle for both fault-free and faulty operations are reported in Fig.
    5.d. Obviously, after fault occurrence at , the system follows the same trend
    as the healthy condition, except for a fluctuation after the moment of fault occurrence
    which is soon compensated. This further highlights the robustness of the control
    scheme. Download : Download high-res image (822KB) Download : Download full-size

    the effectiveness of the state estimation observer, a fit function between estimated
    and actual rotor speed is calculated by Eq. (68). (68) The obtained value of 96.34%
    for this function approves validity of the estimation. The Root Mean Square (RMS)
    Error of rotor speed for the wind turbine with the proposed PFTC and AFTC exposed
    to various wind profiles is shown in Fig. 6. The results clearly prove the outperformance
    of the AFTC and this is more evident for higher wind speeds. Download : Download

    power. These indices are calculated for the three controllers through FAST simulation
    and the corresponding results are illustrated in Fig. 8. When the fault occurs,
    the errors tend to increase, however, with the adaptive TBSM they remain small.

    system against parameter uncertainty also indicates the system robustness. To
    evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed controller, the simulations are performed
    for three different parameter sets, representing 10%, 20%, and 30% uncertainty,
    and in Table 5 the obtained output error on rotor speed is compared with the results
    of FLC and SMC schemes. Evidently, the proposed controller shows the least sensitivity.

    0.000891 FD system detects the faults from the residuals when they exceed their
    predefined values. Here, the residuals are determined based on TDE and illustrated
    in Fig. 9. Evidently, when the fault occurs, the residuals overshoot their corresponding
    thresholds, and FD system is able to detect and isolate the faults. It is noteworthy
    that before , while the model is exposed to wind profile, the residuals remain
    bounded between their thresholds. Download : Download high-res image (601KB) Download

    maximizing power capture by wind turbines, FTC is also responsible for preventing
    unexpected mechanical loads in the presence of faults. Fatigue loads acting on
    the wind turbine components are highly influenced by the controller performance.
    This means that the performance of the FTC is a determining factor on components
    life span. For a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the control system,
    it is required to evaluate the wind turbine structural dynamics and loading and
    make sure that they are within their safe ranges. The time series of blade-root
    out-of-plane and flap-wise moments are calculated and presented in Fig. 10. The
    results show that the time series embodies various load cycles with different
    frequencies (combination of excitation and natural frequencies). Download : Download

    and deflections for the turbine with three controllers in the presence of three
    different faults. It is evident from the results that the proposed AFTC has efficiently

    novel AFTC based on TDE to control the pitch angle of a wind turbine in the presence
    of faults, uncertainties and disturbances. The proposed AFTC comprises a TDE-based
    FD system and a combination of back-stepping, terminal sliding mode and fractional
    order control to increase the robustness. Stability of the closed-loop system
    was proved by Lyapunov theory. In order to verify the validity of proposed controller,
    it was applied to the detailed FAST simulator for two distinct cases, i.e. faulty
    and healthy conditions. Simulations revealed the effectiveness of the proposed
    AFTC. Overall, compared with the existing schemes, the proposed AFTC possesses
    some advantages and improvements including, easy implementation of the proposed
    TDE-based FD system, fast finite time convergence and higher precision due to
    applying supper-twisting algorithm, compensating uncertainties and faults, and
    independence from the prior knowledge of the faults. Credit author statement Category

    Ukraine SECTION I. Introduction Greenhouses provide a controlled environment to
    facilitate crop cultivation. Temperature, humidity, light intensity, and ventilation
    are just an example of the variables that require regular monitoring and regulation,
    to maximize environment suitability for different plant species. Greenhouse sizes
    can vary significantly, ranging from small backyard-sized to one that can span
    multiple hectares. Monitoring and regulation of the various factors mentioned
    earlier, can determine both the efficacy and efficiency of the greenhouse. As
    such, smart greenhouses are a topic of interest for precision agriculture [1].
    Various sensor nodes can replace manual monitoring of the environment conditions,
    such as temperature, humidity, and light conditions [2], [3]. Incorporating Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) capabilities offers the ability to remotely access, store and analyze sensor
    data [4]-[6]. IoT capabilities can also offer remote calibration/adjustment of
    the environment conditions [3], [7]. Based on the sensor data, adjustments can
    be made, such as remotely adjusting actuator nodes to, for example, fine-tune
    fans and irrigation valves [8], [9]. Fault tolerance is another research aspect
    that can drastically improve smart greenhouse efficiency. A fault tolerant NCS
    can increase reliability and yield of a greenhouse [2]. Previous studies have
    investigated the application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Networked Control
    Systems for precision agriculture systems. One such case focused on a hierarchical
    Networked Control System (NCS) of sensors, controllers, and actuators, in two
    greenhouses [2]. The study also investigated and demonstrated fault tolerance
    at the controller level. In [10], an in-depth analysis of the fault tolerant model
    presented in [2] was investigated proving system reliability and availability
    during controller failures. It further extended the greenhouse NCS to incorporate
    a layer of IoT capabilities, connecting the NCS to a cloud-side backend through
    the Internet for data analysis and remote controlling [10]. This paper will study
    an Ethernet/Wi-Fi-based, smart greenhouse distributed NCS, in terms of fault tolerance
    at the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) level [11], [12]. The smart greenhouse NCS consists
    of a varied and large number of sensor nodes to sample the greenhouse environment;
    a controller to process the sensor data and issue control commands; actuators
    to enact the control commands and adjust the environment accordingly. The Wi-Fi
    APs in the proposed model are the crucial bottleneck where all sensor data gather
    prior to being forwarded (via Switched Ethernet) to the controller. As such, it
    is of importance to study the fault tolerance at the AP level. It will be shown
    that the proposed architecture can withstand single as well as double AP failures.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, related works are
    presented. Section III outlines the NCS architecture, the fault model, proposed
    failure handling, and the scenarios to be simulated. Finally, Section IV presents
    the simulation results and Section V concludes this paper. SECTION II. Related
    Work Greenhouse monitoring and regulatory systems fall under the umbrella of Precision
    Agriculture systems. There are various studies that have investigated such systems.
    This section offers a summary of some of the most relevant studies. Reference
    [13] proposed a solution to monitor a small to medium size greenhouse based on
    GSM and RF technology. Monitoring nodes and sink nodes were designed using RF
    modules, Huawei wireless modules and Atmega16A. Another study was conducted in
    [14] regarding the impact of environmental changes on flowers, by proposing a
    greenhouse monitoring system. The system architecture utilized ZigBee technology
    to transmit sensor data to a controller, then transferring the information over
    USB, for display on a graphical interface [15]. In [16], a low-cost and low-power
    WSN architecture is suggested for greenhouse applications. Greenhouse WSNs were
    also studied in [17], [18]. One of the most and recent advancements of greenhouse
    agriculture is its integration with a layer of IoT. In [6], a WSN model was implemented
    to monitor a greenhouse. The greenhouse has a group of sensor nodes that measure
    environmental changes and send their measured data to the greenhouse coordinator.
    The greenhouse coordinator is connected physically to the Internet gateway. Similarly,
    in [1], data collected by the controller is analyzed and stored in a cloud database,
    which the user can easily access remotely. In [19], a monitoring system using
    a low-cost IoT platform Node MCU module, was proposed. The design aims to collect
    all the sensor data, send it to the Node MCU module for processing, and then send
    its control commands to the actuators inside the greenhouse. Additionally, it
    has a wireless Internet connection to send the collected environmental parameters
    to the farmers smartphones for remote monitoring. As for a remotely controlled
    greenhouse, an IoT application for smart agriculture was developed in [7] from
    which the environmental changes inside the greenhouse are remotely monitored and
    controlled. From the collected data, proper control actions are taken for greenhouse
    windows and doors. Similarly, in [4], an IoT layer is deployed inside a greenhouse
    through its connection to a controller and internet gateway over ZigBee. This
    greenhouse has several distributed sensors and actuator nodes. It sends its information
    to the user presenting them on a GUI and receiving the control commands to be
    executed inside the greenhouse. In [8], a system architecture for a vegetable
    greenhouse consisting of four modules, was proposed. The first module is the data
    collection module using different sensors and the second module is the control
    module using different actuators. The third module is the control core module
    that is responsible for collecting the sensor data wirelessly, forwarding data
    to the gateway, and then analyzing the data to take the proper control commands
    to be executed by the actuators. The fourth module is the power module which is
    used to power up the system using solar energy. Water valves for irrigation were
    controlled in [5] through the developing of a wireless moisture sensor network.
    The soil moisture sensors are continually monitoring the soil and accordingly
    send their collected data to the controller from which water valves are turned
    on or off. A ZigBee transceiver is used to send these readings to a gateway, and
    the gateway is responsible for transmitting the data using Wi-Fi or GSM modules
    to the central unit where the data is displayed to the user on any Internet-enabled
    device. SECTION III. System Architecture A. Smart Greenhouse Description In this
    paper, an existing greenhouse architecture is studied in the context of building
    a reliable Networked Control System (NCS) and developing a novel fault-tolerant
    model to protect the system from AP failures. The dimension of the greenhouse
    is 200m×40m, and it is divided into five cells with identical dimensions (40m
    × 40m). Each cell has 40 sensor nodes that are evenly distributed. The total number
    of sensor nodes inside the greenhouse is 200. This greenhouse architecture is
    actually a Networked Control System (NCS) with smart sensors, actuators and a
    controller. Each cell in the greenhouse has a group of sensor nodes and actuators
    that are distributed within the cell. The sensor node is a microcontroller that
    hosts 9 different sensors with different sampling data rates. The difference in
    the sampling rates depends on how critical the measured parameter is. These sensors
    measure different environmental parameters which are temperature, humidity, light,
    dew, salinity, soil moisture and pesticide level. Finally, the most critical sensors
    are fire and CO2 sensors [2]. Table I shows the different sampling rates for the
    used sensors. TABLE I. Sensors Sampling Rates The sensor nodes microcontroller
    has a Wi-Fi interface so that data can be collected and sent wirelessly to a local
    AP within the greenhouse cell which transfers these collected data to a centralized
    controller. The wireless protocol is IEEE 802.11n and the frequency band is 5GHz.
    Due to the abundance of frequency channels, each cell has its own non-interfering
    channel. In addition, every cell has 4 cameras placed at its corners that capture
    live video with a transmission rate of 12 FPS and 5MP resolution. These cameras
    are connected to the controller of the greenhouse via Ethernet cable to reduce
    the interference between the high-rate data traffic and the sensor traffic. There
    are four actuators in each cell in the greenhouse which are used to control lighting,
    irrigation, fans and curtains. Also, there is a fire extinguisher actuator for
    the whole greenhouse. They are all connected to the controller via Ethernet. Each
    actuator performs its action with a different rate, based on the criticality of
    the action. All the actuators take actions every 30 seconds except the fire actuator
    which takes its action every 1 second. Every cell in the greenhouse has its own
    AP which relays the collected data from the sensor nodes to the controller with
    a 10mw transmit power (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Then the controller processes these
    data locally and sends its control commands to the actuators in the greenhouse
    [2]. Fig. 1. Sensor nodes, cameras, and APs in a single greenhouse cell. Show
    All Fig. 2. Greenhouse cells with Wi-Fi APs, connected via Switched Ethernet to
    the controller. Show All B. Fault Model Access points are crucial because they
    are the only link between the sensors and the controller. Assume AP four in cell
    four has failed, part of the data at the controller will be missing and this might
    lead to wrong control actions at the actuators. The controller needs to get the
    entire data to take proper control actions in a timely manner. This is the aim
    of this research paper, to study AP failures: single AP failures, double adjacent
    AP failures, and double non-adjacent AP failures. Fig. 3 illustrates one of the
    main double adjacent AP failure cases. A fault-tolerant model is proposed to mitigate
    these failures achieving proper data management while maintaining minimum packet
    loss. Fig. 3. Greenhouse cells with failed APs in cells four and five. Show All
    C. Fault Handling In case of AP failures, two methods were studied for transferring
    the wireless data sent from the sensor nodes in the failed cell to the controller.
    The first method is for the sensors’ data to be automatically redirected to the
    nearest operational AP. For example, if cell one has an AP failure, all the collected
    data from the sensors will be automatically redirected to AP two in cell two because
    it is the nearest operational one. The second method is to equally distribute
    the sensors’ data of the failed cell between two working APs. For instance, if
    AP three in cell three failed, the sensor data will be equally distributed between
    AP two and four in cells two and four, respectively. Since there are no obstacles
    inside the greenhouse, the communication model will be assumed to be the free
    space model. While it may be ‘indoor’ operation, the environment inside the greenhouse
    can be considered equivalent to an outdoor setting, with line-of-sight between
    all nodes. In order to validate and test the performance of the wireless sensor
    network inside the greenhouse in case of any AP failures, four different simulation
    scenarios were studied to cover all the expected situations that might occur during
    the greenhouse operation. These scenarios are the fault-free scenario, single
    AP failure scenarios, double adjacent AP failure scenarios and double non-adjacent
    AP failure scenarios. D. Simulation Scenarios Fault-free scenario: In this scenario,
    all five APs in the greenhouse are functioning properly. The sensor nodes send
    their data wirelessly to their APs and then the APs relay the collected data to
    the controller for processing and taking the proper control decision by sending
    commands to the appropriate actuators. Single AP failure scenarios: In these scenarios,
    system performance was tested during the failure of any of the five APs inside
    the greenhouse. There are five scenarios where one AP fails at a time. The failure
    might occur to AP one in cell one or AP two in cell two and so on. Certain scenarios
    were chosen to be simulated which represent all five cases. These scenarios represent
    a failure occurring at one of the edge cells of the greenhouse or a failure occurring
    in one of the middle cells. Table II shows all five scenarios while Table III
    shows the simulated scenarios. TABLE II. All Expected Single AP Failure Scenarios
    TABLE III. Simulated Scenarios with a Single AP Failure Double adjacent AP failure
    scenarios: In these scenarios, two adjacent APs fail simultaneously. Table IV
    below presents all possible combinations of double adjacent AP failures. Fig.
    4 also shows the data handling in the case of cells four and five failing. Fig.
    4. Data handling for failed APs in cells four and five. Show All TABLE IV. Double
    Adjacent AP Failure Scenarios Table V shows the simulated scenarios. The scenario
    with failed APs in cells two and three is identical to the one with failed APs
    in cells three and four. Similarly, the scenario with failed APs in cells four
    and five is identical to the one with failed APs in cells one and two. TABLE V.
    Simulated Scenarios for Double Adjacent AP Failures Double non-adjacent AP failure
    scenarios: In these scenarios, there are two APs simultaneously experiencing a
    failure. These two APs are non-adjacent and separated either by one working AP,
    two working APs or three working APs. It is important to have at least one working
    AP adjacent to any of the failed APs to achieve efficient data transfer. Table
    VI shows all the possible combinations for these failures. TABLE VI. Double Non-Adjacent
    AP Failure Scenarios Double non-adjacent AP failure (separated by one working
    AP): In this case, there are two mirror scenarios; the first one has failed APs
    in cells one and three while the other one has failed APs in cells three and five.
    Only the second one is simulated along with another scenario with failed APs in
    cells two and four. Table VII shows the simulated scenarios. Double non-adjacent
    AP failure (separated by two working APs): The scenario with failures in APs one
    and four is similar to the one with failures in APs two and five. Table VIII shows
    the simulated scenario for this case. Double non-adjacent AP failure (separated
    by three working APs): There is only one scenario where two nonadjacent APs failed
    and separated by three functioning APs, namely when APs one and five fail simultaneously.
    TABLE VII. Simulated Scenarios for Two Non-Adjacent AP Failures Separated by One
    Working AP TABLE VIII. Simulated Scenario for Two Non-Adjacent AP Failures Separated
    by One Working AP Since it is a free space environment, the failed nonadjacent
    APs being separated by one, two, or three working APs, can be represented by one
    scenario: Failures in cells one and three. As such, Table IX presents a set of
    scenarios that comprehensively cover all possible single and double AP failures.
    TABLE IX. List of All Simulated Scenarios E. Performance Evaluation Metric In
    order to evaluate system performance, the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) will be the metric
    used in this research. According to [20], the PLR should not exceed 2%. Packet
    loss means that some data will be dropped during the transmission. This can make
    the controller take incorrect control actions due to the missing sensor data or,
    alternatively, not take the appropriate actions [10]. SECTION IV. Simulation Results
    For all scenarios, the simulations were performed using Riverbed Modeler simulation
    tool [21]. If the PLR is ≤2%, this would be an indication that the performance
    of the system is satisfactory. In order to calculate the PLR, the average wireless
    data received from all sensor nodes to the controller, is calculated. As mentioned
    in Table I, sensor nodes have three different sampling rates. Next, it is shown
    how the average expected data received at the controller, is calculated. Based
    on the varying sampling rates of the different sensor nodes, the periodicity of
    the entire system is 30 seconds. The packet loss and average data received are
    calculated within the 30 seconds. The number of sensor nodes inside the greenhouse
    is 200. In 30 seconds: (30/5) ×1×200 + (30/1) ×2×200 + (30/30) ×6×200 =12000 +
    1200 + 1200 = 14400 Bytes Hence, 14400/30 sec = 480 Bytes/sec Therefore, the expected
    average data received at the controller is 480 Bytes/sec. Then by applying a confidence
    analysis on the received data, the packet loss rate (PLR) can be calculated as
    in [22]. PLR= N tx − N rx N tx ×100% (1) View Source where N tx and N rx , are
    the total number of sent and received packets, respectively. In the fault free
    scenario, Riverbed simulations indicate that the PLR is zero which means that
    the packets sent from the sensor nodes to the controller are received entirely
    without any losses. Table X shows that, during the failure of AP two, the transmitted
    data from sensors to controller can be either sent to AP one or be equally distributed
    between APs one and three. It is obvious from this Table that either distributing
    the collected data between two working APs or redirecting them to only one AP,
    maintain a low PLR and achieve successful transmission (PLR is below the 2% threshold
    value). When APs four and five fail, the collected data was automatically redirected
    as follows. Cell four sent its data to cell two and cell five sent its data to
    cell three. The PLR was less than 2% and the scenario was successful. Finally,
    Table XI shows all the proposed scenarios with their corresponding PLR. The PLR
    (%) [µ−Δ, µ+Δ] corresponds to the range calculated after a 95% confidence analysis
    is performed, for each scenario, where µ is the mean PLR experienced in terms
    of data received by the controller, ±Δ (the PLR confidence range, above and below
    the mean). TABLE X. PLR for the Same Scenario with Different Data Handling TABLE
    XI. PLR for All Simulated Scenarios Table XI shows a summary of the results obtained
    from all simulated scenarios. It is clear that the PLR for all scenarios is below
    the 2% threshold value. This proves that this fault-tolerant greenhouse NCS succeeded
    in meeting system requirements. The situation where one cell can carry its own
    load and take over the load of another failed cell, has been demonstrated successfully.
    Furthermore, Riverbed simulations have shown that a cell can carry the load of
    not only its direct neighbor, but instead, that of one cell farther. In all simulations,
    it was demonstrated that all PLR values are far below the 2% threshold, with 95%
    confidence. SECTION V. Conclusion Smart Greenhouses embrace the Internet-of-Things,
    and capitalize on technological advances to monitor, regulate, and control their
    internal environment variables. Through on and off-site (remote) control, a Networked
    Control System (NCS) can greatly improve the operating efficiency and yield of
    a smart greenhouse. This paper investigated a Greenhouse NCS composed of Wi-Fi
    sensors and access points, sampling various environment stimuli. The sensor data
    is forwarded via the access points over Switched Ethernet, to a controller, which,
    after processing, sends actuation decisions to wired actuators. The model also
    includes various monitoring cameras, that transmit their feed to the controller
    over the network. The study focused on the aspect of fault tolerance at the access
    point level, being the main rendezvous point for all sensor data. A fault model
    was presented, focusing on single and double access point failure, along with
    a scheme to handle such failures. Using Riverbed Modeler, simulations showed that
    the system can effectively tolerate up to two access points failures while maintaining
    an acceptable packet loss rate (PLR). Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    with the electrical design optimization of a sensor node by means of thermal test
    used to reproduce the actual operating conditions of the nodes. The results of
    the node characterization through thermal tests are used to improve the node's

    to the actual operating conditions. The effects of a harsh environment on the
    dynamic metrological performances of sensor nodes are not sufficiently investigated.
    Consequently, this work deals with the electrical design optimization of a sensor
    node by means of thermal test used to reproduce the actual operating conditions
    of the nodes. The results of the node characterization through thermal tests are
    used to improve the node’s design and consequently to achieve higher performances
    in harsh operative conditions. Author Biography Gabriele Patrizi, University of

    I. Introduction In the last years, the attention on the concept of agricultural
    4 is significantly increased due to the development of high performance and low-power
    monitoring systems [1]. In particular, the use of monitoring and automatic systems
    allowed the rapid expansion of smart farm [2]–[6]. The main factors that hinder
    this development are the environmental harsh conditions, the large area of the
    farm, the energy consumption, and the system cost. The introduction of new technologies
    and high-quality components designed to endure harsh environment conditions (e.g.,
    in the presence of significant temperature excursions, humidity, vibrations, and
    mechanical shocks) allow to extend the possibility to create new self-made automated
    systems tailored to various experimental conditions [7]. Wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) for agricultural application represent a useful solution to monitor environmental
    conditions and soil parameters on large areas because they enable real-time decision
    making with regard to critical issues [8]–[11]. There are many articles in recent
    literature that analyses the different aspects of the network design in agriculture.
    Another widely discussed topic is the optimization of power consumption in wireless
    sensor nodes (see, for instance, but not only [12]–[14]). One of the most easy
    and practical solutions is to alternate the operation mode of the nodes between
    the active and sleep periods to save energy [15]. Nevertheless, an extension of
    the active phase due to high number of nodes or connectivity problems could lead
    to an overheating of the hardware which is generally not adequately dealt with
    when this kind of design implementations is presented. There are many articles
    that debate the design of new sensor networks and sensor nodes, as well as lots
    of works focus on the characterization of several types of components under different
    stresses. For instance, many articles analyze the effects of temperature on different
    kind of components, such as air temperature sensors [16], medium-voltage cable
    joints [17], semiconductor components [18], mechanical components [19], LEDs [20],
    [21], and capacitors [22]. Quite the opposite, very few works deal with the characterization
    of the complete designed system under stress conditions. Generally, the effects
    of temperature and other stresses on the dynamic metrological performance and
    on the reliability of WSN are not adequately dealt with. Some works such as [23]–[25]
    analyze the effects of raising temperature on WSN focusing mainly on communications
    problems, while its effects on the sensor node hardware are rarely considered.
    Moreover, no international standard for the environmental test of WSNs is available
    and customized standards for the testing of electronic devices are not implemented
    in agricultural applications. For these reasons, starting from the preliminary
    experimental results shown in [26], this article focuses on agriculture monitoring
    system proposing a temperature step-stress test to characterize the behavior of
    the complete monitoring device under thermal effects. The main novelty of the
    article is to propose a test procedure for environmental monitoring system based
    on temperature stress that could be easily extended to any kind of WSN applied
    in different applications. The proposed test procedure will offer a more robust
    and reliable design of a WSN. In particular, a low-power and low-cost wireless
    sensor network is designed and tested using a climatic chamber to analyze the
    system in environmental harsh condition. The article is organized as follows.
    Section II presents the development of the device under test (DUT). Section III
    describes the measurement setup and the temperature profile implemented. Section
    IV illustrates and discusses the measurement results. SECTION II. Prototype Under
    Test The developed wireless sensor network is a mesh topology network characterized
    by a root node and some sensor nodes used for data collection. The Wi-Fi protocol
    and a multiple hop (multihop) transmission allow to cover large area and share
    the data to an online server using only one sink node (also called root node henceforth).
    Therefore, each node in wireless mesh network (WMN) transmits its own packets
    and simultaneously serves as relay for other nodes through the dynamic routing
    tables as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Deployment of the nodes in the analyzed wireless
    mesh sensor network used for environmental monitoring in agriculture field. Show
    All In order to have a complete autonomous system, each node of the network is
    composed by a solar panel, lithium batteries, electronic boards, and sensors as
    shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Analyzed system used as the sensor node in the proposed
    network. The node is composed by a solar panel, two lithium batteries, a 2.4-GHz
    antenna, some sensors, and two electronic boards. All the components except the
    solar panel are closed inside a waterproof customized case. Show All The main
    part of the electronic boards is the ESP32 dual-core microcontroller manufactured
    by “Espressif Systems” mounted on the “DevKitC v4” evaluation board used for software
    programming by means of USB-to-UART bridge controllers, pin interface, and power
    supply by means of an AMS1117 low-dropout regulator (LDO). The ESP32 is designed
    to support Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth (v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE). In particular,
    the IEEE 802.11/n Wi-Fi protocol is implemented. The microcontroller is equipped
    with two eight-channel 12-bit SAR ADC and two 8-bit DACs. The evaluation board
    is in turn mounted on a customized interface board used to connect the batteries,
    the power boards, and the sensors. The prototype is equipped with an air temperature
    and humidity sensor, a soil temperature sensor, a soil moisture sensor, and a
    global solar radiation sensor as shown in Fig. 3. The board is developed to function
    in two different operation phases. A “sleep phase” in which sensors, processing
    units, and Wi-Fi protocol are deactivated to save energy. An “active phase” or
    “operative phase” where the nodes are working acquiring data from sensors, elaborating
    them, and transmitting the information by means of the Wi-Fi protocol to the sink
    node. Fig. 3. Representation of the implemented sensor nodes: the white board
    is the prototype developed to connect the commercial ESP32 and the sensors. Show
    All This behavior allows to minimize the duty cycle, overheating, and power consumption,
    and it is justified by the fact that the meteorological data slowly change during
    the day. Particularly, the developed system is based on a sleep phase of 10 min
    and an active phase demanded by the root node of 1 min. SECTION III. Measurement
    Setup and Methods for Thermal Characterization Temperature and most generally
    all the environmental conditions affect the performances of the electronic devices
    causing fatigue and fracture. Both functional and reliability performance are
    deeply influenced by this kind of stresses, and for this reason, it is mandatory
    to test and characterize this kind of components under thermal effects [27]–[30].
    This article proposes a temperature step-stress test for the environmental characterization
    of a sensor node used in smart agriculture monitoring system. A preliminary functional
    failure analysis is required to understand every possible failure mechanism that
    could lead to faults and malfunctions of the system. According to the international
    standard JEDEC JEP122F [31], the typical and most common failure mechanisms of
    electronic devices are open/short circuit, dielectric charging, electrostatic
    discharge, intrinsic breakdown, diffusion, corrosion, and silicon fracture. A
    temperature test is proposed to investigate the behavior of the DUT at different
    temperature inside the range of guaranteed operability (up to 85 °C for the Espressif
    ESP32 DevKitC board). The following international standards were used to define
    the test profile. IEST-RP-PR-003.1 (2012) [32] defines and describes the accelerated
    life testing, including the temperature step-stress test. ISO 16750–4 (2010) [33]
    illustrates the environmental test conditions for electrical and electronic equipment.
    IEC 60068-2-14 (2011) [34] provides general procedures for temperature testing.
    MIL-STD 810G (2008) [35] contains engineering direction for considering the influences
    that environmental stresses have on material throughout all phases of its service
    life. JEDEC JESD22 A104E (2014) [36] provides guidelines for temperature testing
    of semiconductor devices. The profile resembles the ones proposed in the previous
    standards and is tailored on the practical application scenario. During the pretest
    adjustment, it is very important to place the sample in such a position with respect
    to the air stream such that there is substantially no obstruction to the flow
    of air across and around each sample. The test starts at room temperature (approximately
    20 °C) that is maintained constant for 10 min in order to ensure at least one
    active phase of the system. Then the temperature is raised by 5 °C at low rate
    to allow components’ temperature to increase together with the chamber temperature.
    The complete raise time including settling time is 10 min. The following step
    is 20 min of exposition time at the reached temperature to ensure two active phases
    of the node after temperature stability. The test continues repeating the two
    previous phases until the exposition time at 80 °C. After that, the temperature
    is lowered to 20 °C at low rate to ensure gradual cooling of the components (between
    0.5 and 1 °/min). The step test described in the previous procedure is illustrated
    in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed temperature step-stress test profile for thermal characterization
    of the sensor node in a climatic chamber. Show All The aim of the test is to characterize
    the behavior of three boards under temperature effects. In particular, the test
    focuses on the current consumption of two sensor nodes, one supplied using the
    LDO provided by the manufacturer of the evaluation board (identified using the
    term “Former LDO” henceforth) and the other one supplied using an “AP2114H LDO”
    (identified using the term “New LDO” henceforth). Moreover, the behavior of the
    various sensors is investigated and compared during the test. These two boards
    are equipped with the same firmware, and they work in the classical operational
    conditions of a sensor node described in Section II (active and sleep phases).
    The third board is used for the characterization of the ADC and DAC thermal drifts.
    This DUT works only in the active phase, and it sends data directly to the PC
    without interacting with the network composed by the other nodes under test. The
    complete test bed implemented for the thermal characterization of the sensor node
    is illustrated in Fig. 5. The following equipments are used. A laptop connected
    to the root node in order to acquire the data coming from the network. The PC
    is also used as the interface for the multimeters. A root node that manages the
    functionality of the network and stores data measured by the tested nodes. A temperature
    chamber characterized by a temperature range between 20 °C and 300 °C. A datalogger

    two-channel digital oscilloscope by “Rohde&Schwarz” used for the DAC test. Three
    3440 digital multimeters by “PeakTech” used to measure the current consumption
    of the nodes. A 500-mA dc current source used to emulate the behavior of the solar
    radiation sensor. An arbitrary waveform generator used to provide the input signal
    for the ADC test. Fig. 5. Implemented test bed for thermal characterization of

    SECTION IV. Experimental Results This section reports the experimental results
    achieved during the temperature step-stress test profile. A. Temperature Measurements
    The test was carried out using ten thermocouples to monitor the temperature in
    different locations inside the chamber. Particularly, one channel was placed together
    with the PT100 thermistor used as control signal for chamber setting, while another
    one was located in the opposite side of the chamber. Six channels are used to
    monitor the microcontrollers, the LDOs, and the electronic boards of the two sensor
    nodes. The last two thermocouples are placed together with the air temperature
    sensors and the soil temperature sensors of the DUTs. The complete temperature
    acquisition is illustrated in Fig. 6. The figure shows that all the signals follow
    the profile described in the previous section, except for the soil temperature
    that gradually increases because of the thermal inertia of the soil. Interestingly,
    many temperature spikes were observed in some of the acquired channels, as shown
    in detail in Fig. 7. Each spike represents the active phase of the nodes due to
    the increase in current dissipation to acquire and send data. Fig. 6. Temperature
    monitoring during test acquired using a ten-channel datalogger equipped with a
    k-type thermocouple. Show All Fig. 7. Details of the ten-channel datalogger highlighting
    the increase in the temperature of microprocessors (yellow and purple) and LDOs
    (green and light blue) during the active phase. Show All Fig. 7 highlights a detail
    of the monitored temperature in approximately 1 h between 40 °C and 45 °C. The
    temperature increase during the active phases is marked only on the six channels
    used to observe the behavior of the two DUTs. There are three different overheating
    trends. The highest spikes are caused by the LDOs that increase their temperature
    of approximately 5 °C with respect to the chamber temperature. The lowest spikes
    (overheating of 2 °C) are related to the temperature of the two boards, while
    the microprocessor temperatures increase by 3 °C. The most striking result to
    emerge from the data is that these increases are repeated at each active phase,
    regardless of the temperature of the chamber. The overheating of the sensor node
    is not relevant from a reliability point of view because of the limited transmission
    phase. B. Current Consumption The results illustrated in this subsection are referred
    to the two DUTs used in the classical operational conditions of a sensor node.
    During the step-stress test, the current consumption of the two boards was measured
    using two different multimeters. The aim of the test was to investigate whether
    the New LDO provides significant upgrades with respect to the one provided by
    the manufacturer of the evaluation board (Former LDO). Fig. 8 presents an overview
    of the conducted test, showing the current consumption (blue and green signals)
    on the left y -axis and the temperature used to control the chamber (red line)
    on the right y -axis. The current of the two DUTs follows a cyclic trend alternating
    a very low consumption during the sleep phase and a current spike during the active
    phase. No significant difference between the two currents was evident. Fig. 8.
    Comparison between the current consumption of the two boards (blue and green lines)
    on the left y -axis, while the right y -axis shows the temperature variation during
    the test (red line). Show All Instead, what can be clearly seen in Fig. 9 is that
    the New LDO provides a general improvement of the consumption. Fig. 9. Details
    of the current consumption acquired at 55 °C highlighting the sleep and active
    phases of the sensor node equipped with the Former LDO (blue line) and the other
    one equipped with the New LDO (red line). Show All What stands out in the zoomed-in
    of two generic active phases is that the update of the LDO allows to reduce the
    current dissipation both in the sleep and active phases. Fig. 9 also highlights
    that the active phase could be in turn divided into two subphases: in the first
    one, the Wi-Fi is OFF and the sensors acquire data, while in the second one, the
    Wi-Fi is turned on to ensure the data transmission, with a consequent current
    increase. The Wi-Fi is kept OFF during the initial stage of the active phase to
    minimize the consumption and save batteries’ life. There is also a current spike
    during the “Wi-Fi ON” subphase up to 300 mA that is linked to a particular phase
    of the Wi-Fi transmission. The comparison of the two current consumptions provided
    in Table I reveals that the improvement achieved with the New LDO is even more
    significant during the active phase with respect to the sleep phase. Taking the
    temperature stability of 30 °C as an example, Table I reports the average current
    value during the three identified zones. TABLE I Comparison Between the Average
    Current Consumption of the DUTs in the Different Zones of Work at 30° C The single
    most striking observation to emerge from the data analysis is the presence of
    a current step-up during the sleep phase of the two sensor nodes, as shown in
    Fig. 10. When the chamber reached 58 °C, the current of the board equipped with
    the New LDO (green line) suddenly increased to approximately 4.5 mA. The same
    behavior was also observed in the other board (blue line) at approximately 63
    °C with the identical variation. Fig. 10. Details of the current consumption in
    the middle part of the test showing the observed current step. The current dissipated
    by the board equipped with the Former LDO (blue line) and by the one equipped
    with the New LDO (green line) is plotted on the left y -axis, while the temperature
    (red line) is plotted on the right y -axis. Show All During the cooling phase,
    the current returned to the original value in the same way (first the Former LDO
    and then the New LDO). The step-down happens at a temperature of the chamber slightly
    lower than the step-up due to thermal inertia of the components. Turning now to
    the experimental evidence on the active phase, the average current consumption
    of the two tested boards is illustrated in the left y -axis of Fig. 11 (blue dots
    and blue stars denote the Former LDO and New LDO, respectively). Fig. 11. Average
    current consumption during the active phase: comparison between the mean current
    of the two tested boards (blue dots and blue stars) on the left y -axis and temperature
    trend (red line) on the right y -axis. Show All Each value in Fig. 11 refers to
    the mean value of the current during the respective active phase. As already observed
    in Table I, Fig. 11 highlights the general improvement achieved by the New LDO.
    As observed for the sleep phase, the current step is also present during the active
    phase in both electronic boards. The amplitude of the current variations and the
    temperature at which they happen are the same for the active and sleep phases.
    Additional test with different setup was performed to identify the cause of this
    anomaly. The current step was observed regardless of: the alternation of the active
    and sleep phases (see Figs. 10 and 11); the presence or not of the LDO (tested
    connecting the power supply directly to the ESP32 chip); and the presence or not
    of the interface board used to manage the analog sensors. In summary, this test
    highlights a dependence between temperature and current consumption. More in detail,
    when temperature overcomes a certain threshold value (air temperature of approximately
    60 °C), the current suddenly increases by 4.5 mA. This unexpected behavior could
    be dangerous since it is a remarkable increase that could lead to a fast discharge
    of the batteries. The cause of this current step is due to the increase in the
    reverse current of the Schottky diode (BAT760-7) with temperature. The purpose
    of this diode is to protect the programming device connected through USB when
    the board is supplied by both USB connection and external supplier. The increase
    of the reverse current in the considered temperature range is higher enough to
    enable the USB-to-UART interface controller leading to a 4.5-mA increase of current
    consumption. However, this overconsumption does not cause any hardware or software
    permanent damage. The implemented stress profile activated no failure mechanisms
    in the DUTs, and the boards continue to provide reliable and accurate information
    during all the tests and during the posttest inspections. Even though the introduction
    of the New LDO does not solve the current step anomaly, it provides a significant
    improvement in terms of energy saving. C. Thermal Characterization of the ADC
    This section is referred to the analysis of the ADC thermal behavior using the
    third DUT. The electronic board was not part of the mesh network, but it was directly
    connected to the PC using serial communication. Two channels of the ADC were tested
    as follows. The first channel was connected directly to a constant reference voltage
    provided by the arbitrary waveform generator. The second channel was used to emulate
    the data acquisition from the solar radiation sensor which provides a current
    as output. The current generator serves as input of the transimpedance amplifier
    connected to the ADC. Both channels show a similar behavior under temperature
    stress, providing lower output data when temperature increases. Taking, for example,
    channel 1 connected to the voltage reference, Fig. 12 highlights the thermal dependence
    showing the acquisition at three different temperatures: 25 °C (blue dots), 50
    °C (red dots), and 80 °C (green dots). Comparing all the data in this figure,
    it is possible to see that, the higher is the temperature, the lower is the average
    of the RAW data and the higher is the standard deviation of the ADC output. Fig.
    12. Multiple ADC acquisition at three different temperatures: 25 °C (blue dots),
    50 °C (red dots), and 80 °C (green dots). Show All This temperature drift is even
    more evident in Fig. 13, where the average of the multiple acquisition at each
    temperature (left y -axis—blue dots) is compared with the temperature stress (right
    y -axis—red line). Fig. 13 also shows a symmetric trend: when the temperature
    inside the chamber decreases, the ADC acquisition tends to return to its original
    value. Fig. 13. Mean value of the 256 multiple ADC acquisitions at each temperature
    on the left y -axis (blue dots) and temperature variation during the test on the
    right y -axis (red line). Show All Using the transimpedance amplifier up to 65
    °C, the same results were obtained for the second tested channel. For temperature
    higher than this value, the acquisition chain stops working and produces a zero-voltage
    output. Since there are no other differences between the two channels, this malfunction
    must be caused by the transimpedance amplifier. During the cooling phase, when
    temperature is decreased under 65 °C, the ADC starts providing an output again,
    with the same trend observed in the first channel. This result is not worrying
    since it happens at high temperatures, which are very hard to reach in agriculture
    applications. In summary, this test highlights a deep thermal dependence of both
    the average acquisition value and the standard deviation of the ADC output. A
    multisampling solution mitigates the increase in the standard deviation, but it
    cannot solve the problem of the drift in the average value. It also highlights
    that the integrated circuit used as transimpedance amplifier does not work at
    temperature higher than 65 °C, even if no failure mechanisms have been activated.
    In fact, when temperature returns lower than 65 °C, the amplifier provides the
    same output of that before the test. D. Frequency Behavior of the DAC This section
    is referred to the analysis of the DAC thermal behavior using the third DUT. The
    DAC of the board is used to supply the soil moisture sensor for a very short time
    in order to acquire the measurement. Both the ESP32 DACs were tested, each one
    generating the same two signals in sequence: a 50-Hz positive square wave using
    the maximum dynamic of the DAC. a single positive rectangular pulse to emulate
    a Dirac delta function of maximum allowable amplitude and allowable duration according
    to ESP32 performances. Fig. 14 shows the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the square
    wave acquired using the oscilloscope at 2 MSa/s at different temperature. Each
    signal was acquired after temperature stability in the chamber. The figure was
    cropped up to 10 kHz to highlight the first significant harmonics deleting the
    high-frequency noise. Fig. 14. Single-sided FFT of the square wave generated by
    the internal DAC at different temperature. The magnitude of all the spectra is
    normalized with respect to the first peak (fundamental frequency). Show All Fig.
    14 evidence that there is no temperature dependence of the DAC output in the considered
    range. The FFT resumes that in the first ten terms, the maximum variation of the
    magnitude with respect to the temperature is 0.05 dB, proving a very high stability.
    Turning now to the rectangular pulse, Fig. 15 illustrates the two-side FFT of
    the signal acquired at 1.25 GSa/s. As seen before, the figure was cropped between
    −1 and 1 MHz to eliminate the nonsignificant contributions. Fig. 15. Two-sided
    FFT of the pulse generated by the internal DAC at different temperature. The magnitude
    of all the spectra is normalized with respect to the highest peak (frequency is
    equal to 0 Hz). Show All The main lobe of the FFT does not evidence any variations
    in magnitude and duration at any temperature, while the sidelobe presents some
    minimal alterations in magnitude and frequency. More in detail, the maximum variation
    in the second lobe is approximately 1.5 dB, while in the next lobe, it is approximately
    2.5 dB. Despite these slight oscillations at high frequency, this anomaly is not
    so relevant because the magnitude of the sidelobe is much lower than the main
    lobe. SECTION V. Conclusion Precision farming technologies has rapidly increased
    in the last few years, leading to a significant expansion in the development of
    new meteorological stations. In this scenario, WMN represents a fundamental role
    to ensure fault tolerance and large transmission coverage. This work describes
    the characterization of a low-cost and low-power sensor node for environmental
    monitoring network used in agriculture application. This article proposes a customized
    temperature step-stress test based on several international standards for electronic
    devices. The profile was tailored on the practical application. The implemented
    setup has been used to investigate the effects of raising ambient temperature
    on the transmission phase, the current consumption, and the ADC and DAC outcomes.
    The experimental results show that the overheating of the sensor node with respect
    to the air temperature is not relevant from a reliability point of view. In fact,
    during the active phase, the temperature of the LDO and microcontroller slightly
    increases only for a couple of minutes and then returns approximately equal to
    air temperature. This overheating does not influence the reliability performances.
    Moving now to the current analysis, the test highlights a temperature dependence
    of the current consumption that leads to a current step of approximately 4.5 mA
    at 60 °C. This anomaly causes a higher consumption with respect to the standard
    conditions. The introduction of a New LDO to supply the microprocessor does not
    eliminate the step, but it leads to a consistent decrease in the current dissipation.
    Despite the observed step, no failure mechanisms have been activated by the temperature
    stress, and the boards continue to provide accurate and reliable data. The ADC
    thermal analysis evidence some unexpected behaviors. In particular, a relevant
    ADC drift over temperature was observed along with an increase in the standard
    deviation of the acquisitions. Moreover, the integrated circuit used as transimpedance
    amplifier stopped working at temperature higher than 65 °C. Both these anomalies
    are interesting results but are not caused by significant failures. In fact, decreasing
    the temperature after reaching 80 °C, the anomalies gradually mitigate, and the
    ADC provides a symmetric output compared to the rising phase. Quite the opposite,
    analyzing the FFT of the 50-Hz square wave, the behavior of the DAC over temperature
    has proved to be very stable in the frequency range interested in the application
    field. Some minor oscillations, when temperature increases, were observed only
    at high frequency in the FFT of the rectangular pulse. Authors Figures References

  description: Precision farming is based on monitoring environmental conditions and
    soil parameter to improve productivity, to optimize soil conservation, to save
    water and to limit plant diseases. Wireless sensor networks are an optimal solution
    to implement this monitoring process, covering large area and ensuring fault tolerance.
    Currently, there are no international standards that deal with environmental testing
    of Wireless Sensor Networks; therefore a customized test plan was developed basing
    on a step stress test from 20 °C to 80 °C, with 5 °C steps. The objective of the
    analysis was to investigate the effects of raised temperature on the performances
    of a self-designed sensor node. A customized measurement set-up is presented in
    this paper to test electrical and electronic performances of the node under thermal
    stress.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Beirut, Lebanon SECTION I. Introduction Greenhouses
    have a vital role in modern precision agricultural systems. They provide the ability
    to control agricultural parameters and conditions to create the adequate atmosphere
    for different crops. Accordingly, this provides the capability to overcome the
    environmental and seasonal restrictions in plantation, and produces crops with
    finer quality. The agricultural practices inside the greenhouse are in continuous
    evolvement, starting by deploying different sensor nodes inside the greenhouse.
    These sensor nodes replace the human observations in measuring the environmental
    conditions and parameters inside the greenhouse in order to get more accurate
    measurements with the desired sampling frequency [1], [2]. Furthermore, IoT contributes
    to the evolvement of the greenhouse agriculture [3]. The information about monitored
    parameters using the sensor nodes inside the greenhouse can be analyzed, stored
    over the cloud, and presented over any Internet enabled device [4]. Also, the
    greenhouse enhancement goes beyond monitoring and reporting the environmental
    parameters; it extends to reach the remote control of different greenhouse conditions
    [5]. Based on the information about the greenhouse that is collected using the
    monitoring system, decisions can be taken about what should be done inside the
    greenhouse [6]. However, in previous works, small to medium systems based on Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) were studied for proof of concept. There is no practical
    definition for a system architecture that is ready for implementation on a relatively
    large scale with a guaranteed efficiency and reliability. In this paper, the proposed
    greenhouse architecture is studied as a hierarchical distributed Networked Control
    System (NCS) [7], [8]. This is appropriate since the system is composed of a large
    number of sensors, controllers and actuators interconnected by a shared network
    that is designed to carry small packets and meet real-time control constraints
    with minimal packet loss and high reliability. This NCS is built on top of both
    Ethernet and Wi-Fi, Furthermore, the proposed system is relatively large since
    it consists of two Greenhouses. It will be shown how to find a channel allocation
    that enables this relatively large system to meet all NCS real-time constraints
    such as packet loss and delay [9]–[12]. Next, fault tolerance is investigated.
    Both identical greenhouses are connected over the same network and it is proven
    that they can still meet system requirements even if one controller fails. It
    will be shown that this fault-tolerant architecture increases system availability,
    which is very important especially in developing countries. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows. In Section II, the proposed system architecture is explained.
    Simulation results are discussed in Section III and Fault Tolerance is investigated
    in Section IV. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section V. SECTION II. Proposed
    System Architecture In this paper, two Greenhouses are studied in the context
    of fault-tolerant NCSs, with dimensions 200m × 40m each, and divided into 5 square
    cells (40m x 40m). Each Greenhouse can be viewed as an NCS with a controller,
    smart sensors and the actuators. The two NCSs in the two greenhouses are connected
    to the same network in order to add fault tolerance to the system. This is one
    of the major contributions of this work. This architecture is also IoT-based for
    monitoring and remote control. It is composed of three hierarchical layers: the
    Sensor/Actuator frontend Layer that has the smart sensors and smart actuators,
    the Data Management Layer that consists of the Greenhouse controller and finally,
    the Cloud-based Backend Layer. The Sensor/Actuator frontend layer is composed
    of a group of sensor nodes and actuators distributed in each greenhouse cell.
    A sensor node is a simple microcontroller that hosts a collection of 9 sensors
    with different data rates according to the criticality of the measured parameter.
    Those sensors measure 9 different environmental parameters: Temperature, humidity,
    light, soil moisture, salinity, and dew; they are sampled at a data rate of 1
    byte every 30 seconds. Pesticide sensors are sampled for 1 byte every 5 seconds,
    and the most critical sensors: fire and CO2 are sampled with 1 byte every second.
    The microcontroller for these sensor nodes is equipped with a Wi-Fi interface
    in order to transmit the collected data wirelessly to a local access point for
    the greenhouse cell which relays the collected data to the Greenhouse controller.
    The wireless protocol is IEEE-802.11n with a transmit power of 5mWatts and frequency
    band of 5GHz since it supports a higher number of channels than those from 2.4GHz.
    Due to the abundance of channels, each cell within the same greenhouse uses a
    different frequency channel to eliminate interference. Table I shows the channel
    assignment for both Greenhouses. Also, four cameras are placed in the corners
    of each cell to capture live video with a resolution of 5MP and a transmission
    rate of 12 FPS. Each camera is connected to the controller of the cell via an
    Ethernet cable in order to reduce the interference between its high rate traffic
    and the traffic of the sensor nodes. Table I. Wi-fi channel assignment ID Four
    actuators of the Sensor/Actuator frontend layer are located in each greenhouse
    cell in order to control the lighting, irrigation, fans, and curtains inside the
    cell; in addition, there is a fire extinguisher actuator for the entire Greenhouse.
    Similar to the sensor nodes, the actuators execute actions at different rates
    based on the criticality of the action. All actuators update actions every 30
    seconds except for the fire actuator which takes action every 1 second. The actuator
    nodes are connected to the controller of the respective cell using Ethernet cables
    in order to receive the control action commands from the Greenhouse controller.
    The data management layer is the greenhouse controller that collects the data
    from the sensor nodes of the frontend layer, processes such data locally and accordingly
    takes appropriate control actions inside the premises of the greenhouse. The control
    action is passed to the actuators of the frontend where it is implemented. The
    two Greenhouse controllers share periodical watchdog signals to ensure each one''s
    functionality. If a failure occurs in one of them, the data acquired from the
    greenhouse of the failing controller is forwarded to the other operational controller.
    Thus, this controller takes the required actions for both greenhouses simultaneously.
    This increases the reliability of the greenhouse system as will be shown later.
    A cloud-based backend layer allows the data of the monitored greenhouses to be
    accessible through the Internet. The interface to this backend is implemented
    through an Internet gateway node. Each microcontroller node relays collected sensor
    data to this gateway. The gateway then relays the information (after analyzing
    it and creating aggregate reports) to a cloud server for storage and extensive
    data analysis. The Internet gateway also forwards actuation requests from the
    cloud server to the microcontrollers. Thus, through Internet access, it is possible
    to receive a complete picture of all the information and actions taken inside
    the greenhouses and possibly override the controller actions remotely. The backend
    cloud server facilitates the end-users'' ability to access the sensed data and
    control the actions if needed. These objectives are achieved by implementing a
    set of services such as data storage, data analytics, data security, and data
    visualization. Using Riverbed Modeler [13], the proposed system is simulated where
    the two greenhouses are placed horizontally beside each other. The greenhouse''s
    main controller is connected over Ethernet to 1) the access points of the cells
    2) the Internet Gateway 3) the controller of the neighboring greenhouse as shown
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 illustrates the greenhouse cell. Fig. 1. Greenhouse schematic
    Show All Fig. 2. Greenhouse cell Show All A. Simulation Scenarios In order to
    validate the functionality and reliability of the proposed architecture, three
    different simulation scenarios are performed to cover all the expected situations
    during the operation of the greenhouse. The first scenario is the Fault-Free scenario
    where the main controllers of the two greenhouses are functioning properly. The
    other two scenarios are the Controller Failure scenarios, where the controller
    of one of the two greenhouses goes out of service in each scenario. Fault-Free
    Scenario In this scenario, the sensor nodes in each of the greenhouses are sending
    to their respective controller only. This setup represents the daily operation
    of the greenhouses without any failures. In such a setup, each main controller
    is operational and is receiving data from all sensors and cameras in addition
    to distributing commands to the actuators in the greenhouse. Additionally, a watchdog
    signal of 1B is propagated between the two main controllers at 1 second intervals
    (to acknowledge each other''s ability to operate properly). Controller Failure
    Scenarios In these scenarios, the system is simulated when one of the two controllers
    fails. The other functioning greenhouse controller takes over the operations of
    both greenhouses. In this setup, sensors and cameras of both greenhouses send
    their data to the functioning controller. Similarly, the control action to the
    actuators of the two greenhouses is sent from the functioning greenhouse controller.
    B. Performance Evaluation Metrics The complete information cycle inside the greenhouse
    starts from the sensor nodes when it sends the collected information to the main
    controller of the greenhouse, and ends at the actuators that receive the required
    action commands from the controller. Accordingly, in order to be able to evaluate
    the performance of the proposed system architecture, the metrics that indicate
    whether the different simulation scenarios are performing as desired or not, are
    the Packet Loss and the Delay. Overdelayed packets in the information cycle are
    undesirable, because it will cause taking actions at incorrect timing; therefore
    the total delay for the information cycle has to be below the sampling period
    of the fastest part of the system, which is the fire and CO2 systems (the fire
    and CO2 sensors send information every 1 second and the fire extinguisher actuator
    takes action every 1 second). Hence, all delays must be below 1 second. SECTION
    III. Simulation Results For each scenario, simulations were performed with 33
    seeds for 1800 seconds, and the maximum delays and packet losses for each seed
    were considered and analyzed with 95% confidence. The simulation showed that there
    is no packet loss at any point of time during the simulation of the three scenarios
    over their 33 seeds. Also, the measured end-to-end delay inside the greenhouse
    includes packet transmission, propagation, processing, and queuing delay. Table
    II has the results for the fault-free scenario while Table III has those for the
    scenario where the controller of the second Greenhouse has failed. If the other
    controller fails, simulations results are very similar to those in Table III.
    The values in both tables are the minimum and the maximum of the 95% confidence
    analysis for the amounts of delay, performed for the maximum delay incident per
    seed for the 33 seeds of each scenario. Table II. Fault-free scenario delay Table
    III. Controller failure - scenario 1 delay For the Fault-Free scenario, symmetrical
    amounts of delay are observed for the two greenhouses because the information
    takes similar paths in both greenhouses with no dependency for any of the greenhouses
    on the other (see Fig. 3). For the controller failure scenarios, higher delays
    (specially between sensors and the operational controller) are observed in many
    runs in the greenhouse with the failing controller due to the additional delay
    of forwarding data to the controller of the neighboring greenhouse, and retrieving
    the commands to be executed by the actuators. Fig. 3. Delay from sensor to controller
    in both greenhouses for one seed in error-free scenario Show All It is clear that
    all delays are below the 1 second constraint as explained above. Along with the
    fact that there is zero packet loss, this proves that this fault-tolerant NCS
    system succeeds in meeting system requirements. SECTION IV. Reliability Analysis
    It is clear from the previous section that the control function of the two-greenhouse
    system is fault-tolerant. In other words, the control function is implemented
    by a 1-out-of-2 fault-tolerant architecture. Fault tolerance is expected to reduce
    system downtime. In general, a failed controller may cause damage to plants cultivated
    in greenhouses. The extent of such damage depends on the type of grown crops.
    For example, ornamental plants and flowers can be very sensitive to variations
    in humidity and temperature, and delayed or no actions can cause significant financial
    losses. The same applies to certain types of vegetables and seedlings grown in
    greenhouse nurseries. For these reasons, downtime is very costly. Especially in
    developing countries, repair times can be relatively high because spare parts
    are not usually stored on site or even at the dealer''s premises; they have to
    be imported and customs are rarely predictable. Next is a quantitative study to
    illustrate the effect of fault tolerance on system reliability. As mentioned above,
    the system under study is a 1-out-of-2 system. Let the time to failure be exponentially
    distributed. Hence, the failure rate is constant [14]. Let λ1 be the failure rate

    controller in the second greenhouse (K2). Fig. 4 has the Markov model describing
    the behavior of this 1-out-of-2 system. In state G1 G2, both greenhouse controllers
    are operational. If K1 fails, the system moves to state G2 and both greenhouses
    are operated by K2. This transition has a rate λ1 . While in state G2, K1 is being
    repaired at a rate μ . The same reasoning is true in case K2 fails; the system
    moves to state G1 at a rate λ2 . While in state G2, if K2 fails before K1 is repaired,
    the two-greenhouse system fails completely (state SF). Note that, in Fig. 4, the
    system moves back from state SF to state G1 at a rate μ (assuming a single repair
    person [14]). The same is true for the transition from SF to state G2. This Markov
    model can be solved using the techniques in [14]. dP dt =P×T View Source where

    is a simple case study to illustrate the advantage of using this fault-tolerant
    scheme. Let λ1=(1/6)   month −1 and λ2=(1/8)   month −1 . Furthermore, let μ=2   month
    −1 . Using the software tool SHARPE [15], the Steady State Availability (AVss)
    can be obtained. It is equal to 99.547%. If the spare parts are stored on site,
    μ will increase. Let μ=30  month −1 . AVss will increase to 99.9977%. If fault
    tolerance is not applied to the two greenhouses, AVss for the first Greenhouse
    and the second Greenhouse would be 92.3% and 94.1% respectively if μ=2  month
    −1 . If μ=30  month −1 , AVss will increase to 99.45% and 99.59%. Hence, when
    spare parts are stored on site, fault-tolerance will slightly increase AVss; however,
    if spare parts have to be imported after the occurrence of a failure, fault tolerance
    has a significant effect on AVss. This case study indicates that if it is difficult
    to store spare parts, the proposed fault-tolerant architecture will guarantee
    a very high AVss. SECTION V. Conclusion The development of NCS for greenhouses
    is an interesting topic for research and development. Furthermore, the integration
    of the IoT solutions empowers the greenhouse NCS. In this paper, a system architecture
    for an NCS inside the greenhouse connected to a cloud was proposed, and fault-tolerance
    was incorporated in the design. In the system simulation, two greenhouses were
    placed and the different scenarios were simulated to show that even if one of
    the controllers fails, the controller of the neighboring greenhouse operates for
    both greenhouses successfully. A confidence analysis was performed on the simulation
    results of the system simulation, and all the results showed that the system meets
    all the real-time constraints. Finally, a case study is presented to show that
    this fault-tolerant greenhouse system would still be highly available even if
    spare parts are not stored on site and have to be imported. Authors Figures References

    Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the enabling technology for smart cities, intelligent
    cars and transportation systems, precision agriculture, animal tracking, and all
    data collection and sensing-based applications. In most WSN applications, new
    sensor nodes are added to the network by post-deployment to assure network connectivity,
    to replace dead sensor nodes or to cover more regions in the area of interest.
    This type of network is called Multi-Phase WSNs (MPWSNs). Similarly to classical
    WSNs, multi-phase WSNs require security mechanisms to ensure their deployment.
    However, these networks need specific solutions adapted to the multiple deployments
    of nodes. In this paper, we review, classify and compare the existing key management
    schemes proposed for this type of sensor network. We illustrate both advantages
    and disadvantages of each multi-phase key management scheme. Finally, we give
    some directions to design lightweight robust key management for MPWSNs. Previous

    wireless sensor networksGeneration keysSelf-healing 1. Multi-phase WSNs, principle
    and applications Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a confirmed technology
    designed to sense and collect data in various domains and mainly those where human
    access is difficult, dangerous or unfeasible: forest fire detection, natural phenomena
    surveillance (i.e., volcano, hurricane, etc.), battlefield supervision, etc. In
    these kinds of applications, sensor nodes are intended to work in total autonomy.
    They are powered through non-rechargeable batteries and collaborate to deliver
    the collected data hop by hop to some processing center (called generally sink
    node or base station) [1], [2]. Hop by hop transmission is motivated by two main
    reasons: 1. It uses a short transmission range which remedies the energy constraint
    related to batteries of these miniature sensing devices [3]. 2. It allows a possible
    aggregation of redundant data at intermediate nodes. This aggregation will reduce
    significantly the number of forwarded packets to the sink [4]. However, hop by
    hop communications require network connectivity which can depend on the environmental
    conditions (flat area, mountainous region, field with obstacles, etc.) where sensor
    nodes are deployed. Connectivity may be affected when sensor nodes with low energy
    could not reach long distances. In fact, the sensor nodes of a network do not
    all die at the same time. Routing, security, and aggregation protocols assign
    different tasks to nodes. This is the main reason why some nodes die faster than
    others. Therefore, in most cases, new sensor nodes are added by a post-deployment
    to an existing WSN. This type of network is called Multi-Phase WSNs (MPWSNs).
    A MPWSN is defined as a network where new groups of sensor nodes are added in
    the area of interest at fixed periods or at random times named phases. Each group
    of nodes deployed together at the same phase is called a generation. The lifetime
    of a MPWSN is expanded as long as there are new generations that join the network.
    Multi-phase deployment of nodes offers the following benefits: 1. It is a manner
    to provide a maximum lifetime to a WSN. 2. It ensures the expandability of applications
    (e.g. to cover more regions in the area of interest). 3. It guarantees network
    connectivity by replacing the dead sensor nodes in critical positions such as
    those situated close to the base station. This will avoid network disconnection.
    4. It enhances network security especially where it is exposed to node capture
    attacks. Fig. 1 displays an example of a post-deployment where newly deployed
    nodes provide continuity to network connectivity. The bold nodes are newly deployed
    and are mandatory to ensure network connectivity. They replace the dead nodes
    represented with dashed lines. Download : Download high-res image (251KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. An example of a post-deployment. To achieve
    the benefits of multi-phase deployment, some obstacles must be overcome and, in
    particular, the security aspect, which is the most important issue with respect
    to hostile places where the sensor nodes may be deployed. In view of the post-deployment
    particularity in MPWSNs, secure communications, assuring confidentiality, authentication
    and data integrity, should be established between nodes deployed at different
    times. For example, the message exchange between nodes (that are still alive)
    of the first deployment and other nodes issued from different post-deployments
    must be secured. Key management is an essential element for providing security
    in any network. It consists It consists in computing or distributing a common
    secret that will serve to ensure confidentiality and integrity of communications
    between sensor nodes. This task is not easy to achieve in WSNs because: 1. For
    cheapness and dense deployment purposes, sensor nodes cannot be tamper-resistant
    devices. 2. Sensor nodes are scattered alone in unattended environments and should
    operate in hostile conditions in some applications. An adversary can easily capture
    a sensor node by physically accessing and then compromising its security material
    (keys, cryptographic algorithm, etc.). Many key management approaches are proposed
    for WSNs. However, these approaches are designed to solve the key management problem
    mainly in single phase WSNs, and their security in MPWSNs degrades with time when
    adversaries compromise nodes. So, new key management schemes are proposed to allow
    nodes of different generations to establish pairwise keys and to offer the resistance
    against node compromising attacks [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],
    [14], [15], [16], [17]. The proposed schemes employ a key refresh at each generation
    to limit the effectiveness of adversaries. Consequently, compromised keys are
    harmful only for a short period of time. For the key refresh operation, a basic
    idea would be to pre-distribute the nodes of each generation with random independent
    keys. When we use new randomly generated keys at each generation, adversaries
    cannot guess the upcoming keys by knowing previous or current ones. However, with
    this solution, the sensor nodes deployed at different generations may not establish
    secure communications (no shared keys). So, in order to achieve key connectivity
    between nodes belonging to different generations, the following two methods are
    used: • The keys to use in the next generation are derived from keys of the current
    generation (generally by using a hash function). So, there is some kind of relation
    between the keys of different generations. • Each sensor node of the current generation
    is pre-distributed with a set of keys that will be used in some next generations.
    Several papers survey key management schemes in WSNs [18], [19], [20], [21], [22],
    [23], [24]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no review paper considers key
    management schemes in WSNs where nodes are deployed in generations. The succession
    of sections in this paper is organized as follows. First, the next section lists
    the contributions and explains the novelty of our paper compared to existing ones.
    In Section 3, we describe the adversary model and define the evaluation metrics
    that should be considered when designing key management for MPWSNs. Section 4
    overviews the existing proposed key management schemes in MPWSNs. According to
    the given evaluation metrics, Section 5 presents a comparison of the studied schemes.
    Finally, we conclude by giving some research directions in Section 6. 2. Contribution
    Key management schemes in WSNs are surveyed in several papers [18], [19], [20],
    [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Zhang et al. in [18] classify
    key management schemes in WSNs in three classes based on the encryption techniques:
    symmetric, asymmetric and hybrid. They describe and discuss key management solutions
    within these three classes. Xiaobing et al. [19] describe dynamic key management
    schemes in WSNs. They classify them in two categories: distributed and centralized.
    A key management scheme is dynamic when the pairwise keys are refreshed periodically
    or on demand. In [20], Xiangqian et al. studied the vulnerabilities and security
    issues in WSNs. They summarize the advantages and disadvantages of some key management
    schemes in WSNs. In [21], the authors present the different key management schemes
    in WSNs with eight classes: network-wide key schemes, full-pairwise schemes, probabilistic
    schemes, matrix-based schemes, polynomial-based schemes, combinatorial design
    schemes, and deployment knowledge based schemes. In the class of probabilistic
    schemes, the authors address multiple deployments by three proposals: RoK [7],
    RGM [13] and Zo-RoK [11]. Chi-Yuan et al. [27] propose in their survey a classification
    of some key management schemes based on location-awareness of sensor nodes. Other
    survey papers are proposed in [26], [27], [28], [29]. In each survey, a set of
    key management schemes in WSNs is studied. More recently, the author of [25] surveys
    key management schemes in WSNs for securing group communication. In this work,
    the author considers only key management schemes dedicated to group communication
    security and classifies them in centralized, contributory, and hybrid. In [22],
    [23], [24], authors address self-healing within key management solutions. A key
    management scheme is self-healing when sensor nodes are able to recover lost session
    keys without the intermediary of a key distribution center. The meaning of self-healing
    differs when we have multiple deployments of sensor nodes. In MPWSNs, the goal
    of self-healing is to diminish (up to zero if possible) the impact of node compromising
    attacks. This survey is devoted solely to key management schemes in MPWSNs. We
    first classify these schemes in two different classes: deterministic and probabilistic.
    After that, we detail the schemes within each of these two categories. We also
    compare their security and efficiency. Finally, we point out future open issues.
    Table 1 situates our survey among existing works. We can remark clearly that none
    of the existing surveys investigated multi-phase key management schemes. Table

    where keys are refreshed periodically or on demand. [25] Focuses on key management
    schemes that address security inside groups in WSNs. Our survey Focuses on key
    management schemes adapted to multi-phase deployment of WSNs. 3. Evaluation metrics
    and notation In this section, we describe the metrics used to study and compare
    multi-phase key management schemes. Furthermore, we define the adversary model
    that presents threats to MPWSNs. Table 2 gives the notation used in the description

    Authentication Code In MPWSNs, a sensor node of a given generation j has a limited
    lifetime that does not exceed a fixed number of generations. This number is called
    the generation window Gw. After Gw, the sensor node is considered dead. The time
    period between two successive generations is called a generation period. The sensor
    node deployed at generation j should be able to establish pairwise keys with previously
    deployed nodes in the interval of time . We call overlapping generations, the
    time in which two deployed sensor nodes from two different generations are alive
    at the same time. In Fig. 2, nodes SA and SB are deployed in generations j1 and
    j2 respectively where . The overlapping generations of SA and SB are j2, j3 and
    j4. Download : Download high-res image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Overlapping generations. 3.1. Evaluation metrics A key management scheme
    is generally evaluated by its level of security measured through the following
    metrics: • Forward secrecy (FS): a key management scheme ensures forward secrecy
    if an adversary that corrupts (by a node compromise) a set of keys at some generations
    j and prior to generation i, where 1 ≤ j < i, is not able to use these keys to
    compute a usable key at a generation k where k ≥ i. • Backward secrecy (BS): a
    key management scheme ensures backward secrecy if an adversary that corrupts some
    keys at a generation j where j > i cannot use them to compute a key that has been
    used at any previous generation k where k ≤ i. • Key connectivity: this metric
    indicates whether two or more sensor nodes have a 100% guaranteed or a certain
    probability to have a common shared key after their deployment. • Resilience or
    resistance to node compromising attacks: this metric measures the impact of a
    node capture on the rest of the network. It is given by: Where TLink is the number
    of all pairwise keys, i.e. links, in a network. CLindirect is the number of links
    (between non compromised nodes) that an adversary can corrupt using keys obtained
    by a node capture. • Self-healing: a key management scheme is qualified as self-healing
    if it assures that the security of an attacked network is improved over time.
    When an attacker captures nodes, the security of the network is affected. The
    self-healing feature ensures that the harm caused by the attacker disappears with
    time. Also, a self-healing scheme assures that nodes of new generations are able
    to establish uncorrupted pairwise keys with previously deployed generations. •
    Resource efficiency: the key management process consumes node resources. Resource
    efficiency measures the needs in energy consumption, storage requirement and computational
    operations to perform the steps of a key management scheme. • Scalability: this
    measures the ability of a key management scheme to support a large number of deployed
    sensor nodes. We use the following definitions to evaluate this metric: (i) High:
    when the key management scheme retains the same performance for different network
    sizes. In other words, the key management scheme does not depend on the number
    of deployed nodes. (ii) Medium: when the key management scheme induces reasonable
    costs, in terms of energy consumption, storage requirement and computation, when
    the size of the network increases. (iii) Weak: when the key management scheme
    imposes unsuitable costs with regard to resource limitations of sensor nodes when
    the size of the network increases. • Time synchronization (TS): some key management
    schemes require the sensor nodes to be synchronized to perform some tasks to manage
    keys (e.g. key refresh). This metric indicates whether or not time synchronization
    is necessary for a scheme. 3.2. Threat model This section describes the threat
    model used in this survey to discuss the resilience of the studied schemes to
    node compromising attacks. An attacker is an adversary that tries to reveal the
    plain texts, the cryptographic keys and all kinds of keying material by using
    available techniques and exploring all network vulnerabilities. The most serious
    threat likely to deteriorate the security of a MPWSN is a node compromising attack.
    Based on this attack, we define two adversary models [6], [7]. • Temporary adversary
    model: in this model, attackers compromise nodes during a limited period of time.
    They stop their capturing activities for non-boundary time intervals. • Eager
    adversary model: in this case, attackers compromise nodes continuously and at
    constant rate from the deployment of the first generation of nodes to the end
    of the lifetime of the MPWSN. It is clear that the damage incurred by this adversary
    model will be greater than the damage incurred by temporary adversary model. 4.
    Key management schemes in MPWSNs This section reviews the state of the art key
    management schemes proposed for MPWSNs. We explain each multi-phase key management
    scheme and give its advantages and disadvantages. Existing multi-phase key management
    schemes can be classified as either deterministic or probabilistic. In a deterministic
    scheme, any two sensor nodes have a probability of 1 (sure event) to share at
    least one common key after their deployment. However, in a probabilistic scheme,
    any two sensor nodes share a key with a predefined probability and may not have
    a common shared key. Fig. 3 lists the surveyed schemes according to this classification.

    management schemes. The vertices represent the schemes, and an edge means that
    the idea of the destination (paper) is based on the source. 4.1. Deterministic
    key management schemes for MPWSNs Lightweight key management (LKM) The concept
    of multi-phase deployment is presented for the first time in [5] where a Lightweight
    Key Management (LKM) is proposed. LKM [5] enables two neighboring sensor nodes
    to simultaneously authenticate, the two nodes then exchange random nonce to construct
    a pairwise key if they belong to the same generation. Before deployment, each
    sensor node is pre-loaded with two keys: a generation authentication key and a
    generation key Kj. After deployment, two neighboring nodes authenticate with and
    use Kj to compute a pairwise key as follows: each node SA broadcasts in clear
    a HELLO message that contains its identifier, a random generated nonce and a MAC
    calculated with . The neighboring nodes of SA check the validity of the MAC in
    the received message. By verification of the MAC, the neighbors of SA prove that
    they belong to the same generation. SA can calculate with each neighbor a pairwise
    key by using Kj. Fig. 4 shows the key establishment between two neighbors. We
    remark that LKM [5] does not provide a key establishment between nodes of different
    generations. For this reason, the authors of LKM [5] presented an extension of
    their scheme to solve inter-generation key sharing. In order to enable a key establishment
    between nodes belonging to different generations, additional secret information
    is pre-distributed to nodes before their deployment. Each node of a generation
    i has to store several secrets, each corresponding to an upcoming generation until
    where n is the number of future generations. The authors of LKM [5] assume that
    the sensor nodes at each generation cannot be compromised rapidly after their
    deployment. This may be true for the first generation, but adversaries are inevitably
    present in the next generations. As a result, this assumption is not tolerated
    in MPWSNs. In fact, LKM [5] has an acceptable memory requirement but its resilience
    is weak: an adversary that knows the authentication key and the generation key
    by compromising one node can decipher the communications among nodes that belong
    to the same generation. Download : Download high-res image (114KB) Download :

    Tian et al.’s scheme In [30], Tian et al. proposed a key management scheme in
    MPWSNs. In their scheme, the base station generates a network key for all nodes,
    an individual key for each node, an initial key for each generation and a set
    of masked initial keys for future generations. The masked initial keys are useful
    in key establishment between nodes of different generations. Fig. 5 shows key
    pre-distribution. For example, the nodes of generation j, deployed at time Tj
    are assigned with the initial key IKj and the masked initial keys of the future
    generations. After deployment, the sensor nodes of a same generation establish
    pairwise keys by using their initial key. For sensor nodes from different generations,
    masked initial keys are used to establish pairwise keys. The scheme performs a
    rekeying (a key refresh) periodically or when detecting a compromised node. The
    base station is responsible for initiating rekeying in the network. However, the
    authors do not indicate the method for detecting compromised nodes. This scheme
    requires knowledge of the total number of generations beforehand to generate the
    masked keys of all generations. For a node compromising point of view, this scheme
    presents a weak resilience. A compromised sensor node discloses its pairwise keys
    and the masked initial keys of the upcoming generations. Download : Download high-res

    masked initial keys pre-distributed to sensor nodes at each generation. In [31],
    Tian et al. addressed the key management of the ZigBee standard. They adapted
    their key management scheme in MPWSNs published in [30] to multi-phase ZigBee-based
    networks. Proactive co-operative self-healing in unattended wireless sensor networks
    (POSH) In [17], the authors proposed POSH: Proactive co-Operative Self-Healing
    in Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks. In POSH [17], time is divided into fixed
    rounds. Each sensor node at any generation shares an initial key and a seed with
    the base station. The sensor node uses the seed to generate pseudo random numbers.
    The base station is mobile, thus allowing it to securely refresh the shared seed
    with nodes and reset their round counter. POSH [17] uses colors to model node
    compromising. Each sensor node is in one of the states; red, green or yellow as
    shown in Fig. 6. Red sensor nodes are those currently controlled by an attacker,
    green sensor nodes are those that have never been compromised, and yellow sensor
    nodes are those that have been compromised in some previous rounds. Each sensor
    node produces n pseudo-random values (called contributions), and sends each value
    to n randomly selected neighbors. The neighbors use received values to update
    their keys at the end of each round r. A green or yellow sensor node moves to
    the red state if it is compromised. A yellow sensor node moves to the green state
    if it receives a random value from at least one green neighbor. According to the
    authors, the fact that each sensor node serves as a source of randomness for its
    neighbors makes POSH [17] a self-healing scheme. Download : Download high-res

    of sensor nodes in POSH [17]. POSH [17] is simple and requires small message overhead.
    However, the authors of POSH [17] assume that compromised sensor nodes follow
    the protocol rules given in Fig. 6 even if they are physically contorted by an
    attacker which is a naive hypothesis. Furthermore, POSH [17] relies on the mobility
    of the base station to refresh sensor node keys, which makes the base station
    a point of failure. Proactive co-operative link self-healing (POLISH) POLISH (Proactive
    co-Operative LInk Self-Healing) [16] is a deterministic key management scheme
    based on polynomial key pre-distribution [32]. POLISH [16] is inspired from POSH
    [17] to ensure self-healing, but differs in the pre-distributed secret to nodes
    before deployment. In POLISH [16], a random bivariate polynomial f(x, y) over
    a finite field Fq is generated, where q is a large prime number and f(x, y) is
    a symmetric polynomial; . Time is divided into fixed rounds. Each sensor node
    Si is pre-distributed with f(x, i) and a PRNG with a secret seed s. After deployment,
    two neighboring sensor nodes Si and Sj exchange their identifiers (i and j) to
    compute the same key where . After key establishment, sensor nodes delete all
    the coefficients of their polynomial. Thus, POLISH [16] does not support key establishment
    between nodes of different generations. Each generation has its own polynomial.
    At the beginning of each round r, each sensor node Si produces pseudo-random values
    using its PRNG, where n is the number of its neighbors. Then, Si sends to each
    neighboring sensor node a random value encrypted with the pairwise key (the same
    idea as in POSH [17]). When Sj receives its random value, it computes the new
    key to be used in the round r by : . The seed si of Si is also refreshed after
    each round using all received random values by: . In POLISH [16], if a sensor
    node is compromised during key establishment and before it deletes the polynomial’s
    coefficients, the attacker is able to compute any pairwise key in the network.
    He may also impersonate any sensor node and can create legitimate links. 4.2.
    Probabilistic key management schemes for MPWSNs In [33], Eschenauer and Gligor
    proposed RKP, the first probabilistic key management scheme based on random key
    pre-distribution. While, their scheme is efficient, its security deteriorates
    with time when an attacker compromises nodes. This means that the scheme is not
    self-healing. However, RKP [33] is the basic idea behind the most recently published
    papers on key management in MPWSNs. In this subsection, we first describe RKP
    [33], then we discuss probabilistic multi-phase key management schemes. In RKP
    [33], each node randomly picks a set of m keys from a random generated key pool
    P before deployment. Any two nodes have a certain probability to share at least
    one common key. The probability pi that two neighboring sensor nodes share i keys
    after deployment is given by [33], [34]: (1) The probability p that two sensor
    nodes have at least one common key is given by: (2) After deployment, each sensor
    node broadcasts its key identifiers to enable its neighbors to check if there
    is a common shared key. If a sensor node finds a common key identifier with a
    neighbor, the corresponding key is used to secure their link. Neighboring sensor
    nodes that do not share a key try to find a secure path to establish pairwise
    keys. The challenge of RKP [33] is to find a good arrangement between the size
    of the key pool P and the number of pre-distributed keys m for a maximum sharing
    probability. RKP [33] has weak resilience to node compromising attacks: an eager
    adversary that continuously captures nodes, will eventually collect the whole
    key pool after some node compromising, and all new deployed nodes will establish
    links with corrupted keys. RKP [33] does not self-heal because the key pool P
    contains keys that are not refreshed throughout network lifetime. So, the number
    of affected links increases when the number of compromised nodes increases. RKP
    [33] is flexible. It allows the addition of sensor nodes, but is not designed
    for MPWSNs. The use of a static key pool for all new added sensor nodes makes
    this scheme unsuitable for MPWSNs. However, refreshing the key pool for post-deployments
    offers a valuable opportunity to reduce the damage incurred by adversaries that
    compromise nodes. In the following, we study the existing key management schemes
    in MPWSNs. Robust key pre-distribution protocol for MPWSNs (RoK) RoK [7] is the
    first proposed probabilistic key pre-distribution scheme adapted to MPWSNs. RoK
    [7] improves resiliency against node capture attacks compared to RKP [33] by refreshing
    the key pool at each new generation. RoK [7] has, for each generation j, a key
    pool KPj divided into a forward key pool FKPj and a backward key pool BKPj. Where
    and . At generation each key is refreshed as follows: and . Each sensor node SA
    at a generation j is pre-distributed with m keys; m/2 forward keys from FKPi and
    m/2 backward keys from BKPi, where: f(A‖l‖j) is a function that gives the index
    of the lth key in the generation j. SA will be able to establish pairwise keys
    with sensor nodes of the previously deployed generations that are alive and with
    k upcoming generations where . When SA is deployed, it diffuses a message containing
    its identifier and its generation value. Suppose that SB, deployed at generation
    i, is neighbor to SA where (i < j). SB can calculate key indexes of SA and then
    checks whether they share some similar keys. Suppose that SA and SB have the set
    of τ1, τ2,…, τk in common. SA and SB establish a pairwise key KAB that will be
    used in their overlapping generations which are . The pairwise key KAB is computed
    as follows: In RoK [7], the forward key pool provides backward secrecy since an
    adversary cannot learn previous keys even if he learns some forward keys at a
    current generation. Similarly, the backward key pool provides forward secrecy
    since an adversary cannot learn future keys even if he learns some backward keys
    at a current generation. When an eager adversary compromises nodes, he gets some
    keys of the used key pool. However, when refreshing both forward and backward
    key pools at each new generation, network security self-heals and does not deteriorate
    with time. RoK [7] needs to know a priori the number of generations n that will
    be added to the network, otherwise, we cannot generate the first backward key
    pool BKPn. Also, it induces additional energy consumption in each sensor node
    to refresh the pre-distributed keys and to calculate the pairwise keys. Authors
    in [13], [14] analyze resilience against node compromising attacks when the key
    pool is split into a forward and a backward key pool. Fig. 7 shows the number
    of failed capture attacks due to the use of backward and forward key rings. A
    failed attack is when an attacker cannot utilize compromised keys of a generation
    to compute non compromised keys of a next generation. From Fig. 7, we see that
    the number of failed capture attacks due to backward key rings linearly increases
    over time. This proves that the use of backward key rings prevents links from
    being compromised. However, the number of failed capture attacks due to the forward
    key rings remains constant around generation 5. This proves that the forward key
    rings are ineffective in resisting against node compromising attacks after a certain
    number of generations. The reason of this is that, once an adversary discovers
    some forward keys, he can repeatedly compute a set of forward keys of upcoming
    generations by simply hashing. Therefore, the forward key pool is totally revealed
    after some generations. Motivated by this analysis, the authors in [13], [14]
    proposed RGM (Random Generation Material). Download : Download high-res image

    attacks of RoK [7]. Forward key pool size is 10,000 and backward key pool size
    is 10,000; key ring size is 500. The adversary randomly captures 30 nodes per
    generation. Source: Ergun et al. [14]. Random generation material (RGM) RGM [13],
    [14] is a resilient key pre-distribution scheme for MPWSNs. RGM [13], [14] does
    not use a forward key pool for the mentioned drawback. Each generation has one
    randomly generated key pool called Generation Key Pool (GKP). There is no relationship
    between the generation key pools of different generations. Use of independent
    generation key pools makes RGM [13], [14] more robust to node compromising attacks
    than other schemes that use linked key pools for generations. Each node SA at
    a generation j is pre-distributed with a key ring that contains; (1) m keys picked
    from the generation key pool and (2) n keys from each generation of the Gw of
    SA. allows establishment of keys with nodes deployed in the generations between
    j and . After deployment, each sensor node SA broadcasts its key indexes and its
    generation value. If a neighbor node SB belongs to the generation of SA, they
    check if they have common keys in their m generation keys. Else, SB and SA verify
    if they have common keys in the keys. Assume that SA and SB are two neighbors
    that belong to the same generation and have common generation keys . They calculate
    their pairwise key as follows: Key connectivity in RGM [13], [14] is the same
    as in RKP [33] when sensor nodes belong to the same generation. However, key connectivity
    between sensor nodes of different generations is very reduced. With respect to
    the storage requirement, RGM [13], [14] has a high memory overhead, because each
    node has to store keys. Yilmaz et al.’s schemes Yilmaz et al. [8], [35] proposed
    a new scheme that improves resilience against node compromising attacks compared
    to RoK [7]. Yilmaz et al. [8], [35] take into account the time dimension to achieve
    the self-healing property rapidly. Their idea is to use keys of some future generations
    to generate keys of the next generation. Keys are used earlier than their expected
    times, and the network self-heals rapidly because it behaves as it has the state
    of some future generations. Each generation key pool will contain a part of unpredictable
    keys for attackers. Yilmaz et al. [8], [35] use the same steps of RoK [7] for
    the first generation. For the next generations, they presented two different deployment
    models; Constant Offset Future Random Generations (COFRG) and Growing Offset Future
    Random Generations (GOFRG). In COFRG, each sensor node SA at generation j chooses
    a number X between and where D is a deployment window. SA is pre-distributed with
    keys from the key pool of generation X. In GOFRG, each sensor node SA at generation
    j chooses a number X between and . Its generation value is where T is the fixed
    jump value selected a priori. In the scheme of Yilmaz et al. [8], [35], key establishment
    is performed as in RoK [7]. This scheme requires prior knowledge of the total
    number of generations. Furthermore, its key connectivity is reduced with respect
    to RoK [7]. Zone-based random key pre-distribution scheme (Zo-RoK) Kalkan et al.
    [11] proposed a zone-based random key pre-distribution scheme called Zo-RoK. Zo-RoK
    [11] combines the best parts of random key pre-distribution using deployment knowledge
    [36] and RoK [7]. In Zo-RoK [11], the network area is divided into zones. For
    each generation, zone key pools {S1, S2,…, Sn} are used with a reduced number
    of keys in each zone where n is the number of zones. A zone key pool S is divided
    into S/2 forward keys and S/2 backward keys. S is refreshed via a hash operation
    as in RoK [7]. The forward and backward key pools of adjacent zones share keys.
    As presented in Fig. 8, horizontal and vertical neighbor zones share n × S keys,
    and diagonal neighbor zones share d × S keys, where . Each sensor node of a particular
    zone i obtains its key ring m′ from its zone key pool Si before deployment. Sensor
    nodes in Zo-RoK [11] are pre-distributed with reduced key rings from their corresponding
    zone key pool. Zo-RoK [11] has a reasonable memory overhead. When an attacker
    captures a sensor node, less information is revealed, and thus resilience against
    sensor node compromising increases. Zo-RoK [11] improves the security of RoK [7].

    Fig. 8. Shared keys between neighboring zones. Zo-RoK shares with RoK [7] the
    same drawback: the number of network generations must be known a priori. Furthermore,
    the deployment knowledge assumption is not available in some MPWSN applications
    which restricts use of Zo-RoK [11]. Multi-phase deployment key establishment (MPDKE)
    In [10], a scheme called Multi-Phase Deployment Key Establishment (MPDKE) is proposed.
    In MPDKE [10], an initial key pool KP1 is generated. Then, for each new deployed
    generation a new key pool is derived from the previous one using a one way hash
    function H, as illustrated in Fig.9. MPDKE [10] has three stages; key pre-distribution,
    direct key establishment, and multi-phase deployment node addition. In the key
    pre-distribution stage, the setup server generates a large key pool KP1 for the
    first generation and assigns to each key a unique identifier. Then, the setup
    server generates the key pools of all upcoming generations as presented in Fig.
    9. Before deployment, each sensor node at generation j is pre-distributed with
    a key ring that contains the following information: m keys from the key pool KPj
    with their identifiers and the generation number j. In the second stage (see Fig.
    10), each sensor node SA broadcasts a HELLO message containing its identifier
    and receives HELLO messages from its neighbors. SA then constructs a list of its
    neighbors. Then, each sensor node sends its key identifiers, the value of its
    generation and a random nonce (to ensure freshness) to each sensor node in its
    list of neighbors. Each two neighbors checks whether they have common keys in
    their key rings. If they find one or more common keys, their pairwise key is computed
    using a pseudo-random function. Finally, each sensor node creates a puzzle message
    using the calculated pairwise key and sends it to its neighbor in order to solve
    it and sends back the response. When neighboring sensor nodes finish key establishment,
    they increment their generation value. In the third and last stage, the already
    deployed sensor nodes update their key rings using the one way hash function and
    keep the same key identifiers. The sensor nodes of a new deployed generation perform
    a key establishment similar to stage two. MPDKE [10] has high communication and
    computation overheads. The self-healing property is not insured because an attacker
    that compromises a sensor node can use the one way hash function to generate a
    set of keys in any upcoming generation. Download : Download high-res image (39KB)

    Direct key establishment in MPDKE. Simple random key pre-distribution with self-healing
    property for MPWSNs (S-RKP) Miyaji and Omote [9] proposed S-RKP, a simple random
    key pre-distribution with self-healing property for MPWSNs. The authors of S-RKP
    [9] modify RKP [33] to provide continuous resilience over time. Their idea is
    to update the key pool gradually at a fixed rate at each generation. For the first
    generation, the server uses a seed s and a hash function H to generate the key
    pool KP0 where . Each sensor node SA at a generation j is pre-distributed with
    a key ring m from KPj. Network lifetime is divided into fixed rounds. At the end
    of each round a new generation of sensor nodes is deployed. The key pool is updated
    by the server at the end of each round r with a renewal size δ as follows: Where
    the updated keys are calculated as follows: . An example of key updating is shown
    in Fig. 11, where . At each round, δ keys are updated in a key pool. After rounds,
    all keys in the key pool will be updated. Thus, the value of δ is important and
    influential in S-RKP [9]. High value of δ increases resilience to node compromising
    attacks but decrease key connectivity. S-RKP [9] ensures forward secrecy by using
    of the one way hash function H. Backward security is also ensured by the using
    the seed s known only by the server. Compared to the proposed multi-phase key
    management schemes, S-RKP [9] is computationally efficient. It does not require
    hash operations at node level, thus conserving node energy and extending their
    lifespan. With respect to the key connectivity of S-RKP [9], it depends on the
    value of δ. When δ increases, key connectivity decreases. Download : Download

    in S-RKP [9]. Hash Graph based key pre-distribution scheme for MPWSNs (HaG) HaG
    [12] is a key management scheme for MPWSNs based on RKP [33]. HaG [12] uses a
    hash graph of keys to refresh the key pool at each generation. This scheme has
    three steps: key pool generation, key ring pre-distribution and pairwise key establishment.
    Network lifetime is divided into rounds. At generation 0, an initial key pool
    KP0 is randomly generated, where . To construct the key pool of the next generation
    KP1, each two sequential keys of KP0 is XORed and hashed to calculate a key of
    KP1; as plotted in Fig. 12. In this way, all key pools of the network are generated.
    Each key pool KPj of generation j is divided into L groups of g keys. Each sensor
    node SA is pre-distributed with keys from L. The key ring of SA is: where . After
    deployment, sensor nodes start the third step which consists of pairwise key establishment.
    Each sensor node SA broadcasts its generation value and its identifier. Neighboring
    sensor nodes of SA use these two values to compute the key indexes of its key
    ring KRA. Then, SA and its neighbors check whether they have a common shared key.
    At the end of each round, each sensor node generates its key ring of the succeeding
    generation and deletes those of generation j. HaG [12] has high computation and
    memory overheads. For a key ring of m = 250 keys, a sensor node has to perform
    250 XOR-hash operations at each succeeding generation. If Gw is equal to 5 for
    instance, each sensor node executes 250 × 5 XOR-hash operations, which is a strong
    computational requirement and energy consuming. Furthermore, each sensor node
    stores its key ring m and has to store the generated key ring of size m of the
    next generation, in total keys to store. A compromised sensor node at generation
    i discloses keys that will be used in [i, ] generations from different key groups.
    Another drawback of HaG [12], is that an attacker can launch an energy exhausting
    attack by simply broadcasting a forged node identifier and a false generation
    value in order to induce neighbors to carry out unnecessary computations. Download

    Key pool update method in HaG. Random polynomial-based key pre-distribution scheme
    for MPWSNs (RPoK) RPoK [15] is a resilient Random Polynomial-based Key pre-distribution
    scheme for MPWSNs. Its idea is to apply the polynomial-based scheme [32] to RoK
    [7]. RPoK [15] consists of three parts: pool generation, ring assignment and establishment
    of secure links. In the pool generation, three pools are generated at each generation
    j, namely: the forward key pool FKPj, the backward key pool BKPj and the polynomial
    pool . The key pools FKPj and BKPj are similar to RoK’s key pools [7]. In PLPj,
    each polynomial is calculated by involving the polynomial of the previous generation
    and two constants: . The two constants and are given by: and . In the ring assignment,
    each sensor node SA at a generation j is pre-distributed with where . After deployment,
    the sensor nodes proceed to the third part: the establishment of secure links.
    Each sensor node discovers its neighbors in order to establish pairwise keys as
    in RoK [7]. Any two neighbors calculate the indexes i and check if they share
    a common polynomial. The pairwise key of these two neighbors is calculated by
    hashing the obtained result of the (shared) polynomial evaluation in their identifiers.
    All established pairwise keys are refreshed periodically. RPoK [15] ensures forward
    and backward secrecy. Its memory and computation overheads are higher than in
    RoK [7] as the nodes have to store and evaluate polynomials. 5. Discussion In
    this section, we compare the studied schemes using the evaluation metrics defined
    in Subsection 3.1. As shown in Table 3, time synchronization is not required in
    LKM [5], MPDKE [10], S-RKP [9] and Tian et al.’s schemes [30], [31]. However,
    POLISH [16], POSH [17], RoK [7], RGM [13], [14], Zo-RoK [11], RPoK [15], HaG [12]
    and Yilmaz et al.’s schemes [8], [35] need synchronization between nodes, otherwise
    they cannot be applied. It is preferable for key management schemes in MPWSNs
    not to require time synchronization between sensor nodes so as to save energy.
    Non-use of a synchronization protocol prevents nodes from exchanging messages
    in order to synchronize their clocks, thus resulting in lower energy consumption.

    RoK [7] (namely Zo-RoK [11], RPoK [15] and Yilmaz et al.’s schemes [8], [35])
    ensure forward and backward secrecy. They are also self-healing. In contrast,
    these schemes are not efficient with regard to computation. MPDKE [10] does not
    provide self-healing, as a disclosed key ring of a compromised node can be hashed
    to obtain a key set (with the same size as the key ring) in the next key pool.
    Consequently, the effect of node compromising attacks does not disappear over
    time. The backward secrecy property is easy to achieve through limiting the key
    lifetime and refreshing keys by a one way hash function at each generation. On
    the other hand, forward secrecy is ensured in schemes that use a separate backward
    key pool refreshed by a downward hash chain as in the Lamport method [37]. Regarding
    resilience in the comparison given by Table 3, Robust means that the scheme self-heals
    after the end of the generation period of the compromised nodes, Less-robust means
    that the effect of the compromised nodes at the current generation propagates
    to fixed succeeding generations, Brittle denotes that the compromised nodes affect
    all next generations of the network. In deterministic schemes, key connectivity
    is 100 %. Sensor nodes certainly have a shared key after their deployment. In
    probabilistic schemes, a high key connectivity is obtained by adjusting the values
    of P and m. It is shown in [33], [34] that P and m can be arranged to reach a
    100 % key connectivity. However, despite this, two adjacent sensor nodes may not
    have a shared key. RoK [7], RPoK [15] and Yilmaz et al.’s schemes [8], [35] have
    a key connectivity p given by formula (2). This probability is maintained for
    sensor nodes of different generations within their overlapping period. In HaG
    [12], sensor nodes at the same generation have a probability p to share a common
    key. However, sensor nodes of different generations have a reduced probability
    p′, because in each key pool after KP0, a random generated key is added. This
    new key is not known by deployed sensor nodes and is involved in all upcoming
    key pools. So, p′ decreases progressively. In RGM [13], [14], key connectivity
    is p when sensor nodes belong to the same generation and p′′ (when p′′ < p) otherwise.
    Zo-RoK [11] attains a good key connectivity p of formula (2) with reduced values
    of P and m by using the deployment knowledge. For random key pre-distribution
    based schemes, there is a tradeoff between key connectivity and resistance to
    node compromising attacks. A small key ring size increases scheme resistance but
    decreases the probability that two neighbors share at least one common key. Conversely,
    a large key ring size increases key connectivity but decreases network resistance.
    From Table 4, we remark that RGM [13], [14] and RPoK [15] have an important amount
    of memory requirement. For this reason, their scalability is noted as weak. If
    we have to deploy a large number of sensor nodes with a large key pool to increase
    resilience, these two schemes are unsuitable with regard to the tiny memories
    of sensor nodes. In LKM [5] and MPDKE [10], each sensor node broadcasts a HELLO
    message after its deployment, and the number of messages increases linearly with
    the number of nodes in the network. Therefore, the scalability of these two schemes
    is medium. In POSH [17], scalability is medium due to the use of a mobile base
    station to refresh sensor node seeds. A large amount of time is allocated to refresh
    the seeds in the case of a large scale WSN. Each sensor node in POLISH [16] sends
    messages to each neighbor at the beginning of each round. So, a dense network
    with many neighbors requires a large number of messages. This is why scalability
    of POLISH [16] is medium. For HaG [12] and Tian et al.’s schemes [30], [31] medium
    scalability is justified by the calculation required at sensor node level. RoK
    [7], Zo-RoK [11] and Yilmaz et al.’s schemes [8], [35] require hash operations
    on sensor nodes but do not depend on the number of nodes. S-RKP [9] has high scalability
    for its calculation efficiency. Table 4. Comparison of efficiency metrics. λ the

    in all next generations. ‘ ’ describes the fact that the attacker can calculate

    Key connectivity decreases over time In order to further analyze the probabilistic
    studied schemes, we evaluate their key connectivity and resilience to node compromising
    attacks. Fig. 13 plots key connectivity of the schemes with a fixed key ring.
    We can see that the schemes, mainly for the first generation, have close key connectivity
    values. Download : Download high-res image (240KB) Download : Download full-size

    keys). Fig. 14 presents resilience to node compromising attacks for 10 generations
    where one node is compromised at each generation. MPDKE [10] has the highest percentage
    of compromised links because the compromised keys from the first generation are
    usable in the next generations. In S-RKP [9], resilience depends on the rate δ
    of updated keys at each generation ( in the figure). Download : Download high-res

    conjunction with resilience. We remark that resilience is better when the key
    pool is large and the key ring is small. This decreases the storage requirement
    but reduces key connectivity. Inversely, a large key ring increases key connectivity
    but affects resilience when nodes are compromised. 6. Conclusion Post-deployments
    are necessary in WSNs that are designed to operate for a long period of time.
    Dead nodes have to be replaced by new ones issued from post-deployments. Organizing
    the groups of new deployed sensor nodes within generations is a way of facilitating
    network management. However, multi-phase deployment has a negative impact on the
    efficiency of existing key management schemes used to ensure confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity of communication within these networks. Consequently,
    these schemes must be revised to be adapted to post-deployment. In this paper,
    we presented a state of the art of multi-phase key management in MPWSNs. We classified
    existing schemes in two categories, i.e., deterministic and probabilistic. Afterwards,
    we discussed and compared the existing schemes. Our study highlights the following
    open issues: • Addressing sensor node failures: sensor nodes are prone to failures
    due to hardware failure, battery depletion or attacks. Multi-phase deployment
    can also be considered as a solution to these failures. For this prospect, we
    need to know the impact of multi-phase deployment on fault tolerance key management
    solutions and also how multi-phase deployment can enhance these solutions. • Key
    management in mobile MPWSNs: applications such as wildlife tracking and patient
    tracking can be solved by the use of mobile MPWSNs [43]. Key management in mobile
    MPWSNs is a very challenging task that is not investigated in the specialized
    literature. Mobile MPWSNs are an open research field. • Real-world applications:
    none of the existing key management schemes in MPWSNs are implemented in a real-world
    application. All the existing schemes are evaluated via a simulation or analytical
    analysis. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate them in real-world environments to
    highlight their degree of applicability [44]. • Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios:
    WSNs are considered to be the key technology in the IoT [45]. MPWSNs consist of
    a part of the IoT when sensor nodes send their collected data to one or more internet
    servers. Securing communications between sensor nodes and servers is a critical
    issue. Consequently, key management is an unavoidable task in IoT scenarios that
    integrate MPWSNs. References [1] P. Rawat, K.D. Singh, H. Chaouchi, J.M. Bonnin

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Ramanathapuram, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Wireless sensor network is the network of nodes that spatially distributed on
    the sensor field that have the responsible to sense the sensor data on the environment.
    For example the grove moisture sensor is the responsible to sense the moisture
    content available on the soil. In mesh topology the path between nodes are not
    specified in the architecture manner. In this the mesh topology are defined in
    various forms that is fully mesh network, Star (point to multipoint) network,
    Peer-to-peer mesh network, Cluster tree mesh network and finally the mesh topology
    faces the problems are AccessinG the medium. Discovering routes, Adapting to changing
    the environment, Sleeping and security issues. The connected dominating set serves
    as the virtual backbone to the wireless sensor network. Because there is no any
    infrastructure and centralized management are not followed on that so the wireless
    sensor network will make the efficient topology on that by using this CDS. Usually
    the sensor network is the thousands plus nodes are available on that system. To
    improve the fault tolerance of the system using the fault tolerant approaches
    for the wireless sensor network. The main goal of the fault tolerant technique
    is enable to access the various techniques and algorithms in the presence of the
    node failure available in the wireless sensor network. Failure of sensor nodes
    in the wireless sensor network may result in problem to make communication among
    the sensor nodes. When a collection of sensor nodes in the network may unable
    to make a communication WSN make to improve the efficiency of the network. To
    tolerate such failures available on the network to detect the fault and provide
    some energy efficient fault tolerant techniques to improve the communication between
    the sensor nodes. Precision agriculture filed is the one that integrate the information
    from the agricultural field and the production output get from the farming system
    to produce an efficient farming system. Agricultural field be developed based
    on the new trend technologies available on the world. Mainly here include the
    wireless sensor network that is WSN based on the sensors to perform some particular
    action on the sensor field which has a responsibility to sense the environmental
    conditions like moisture level, temperature and so on. Then zigbee is used to
    make a wireless communication between the sensors available on the sensor field.
    The WSN is used for many applications and for monitoring purposes also defined
    as an integrated information and production-based farming system that is designed
    to increase long-term, site-specific and whole-farm management. Precision agriculture,
    the future of farming, is a method of farm management that allows the grower to
    produce more efficiently and realize greater economic gains through controlled
    use of their input resources. The application of WSNs allows farmers to make more
    informed decisions on the efficient use of resources. The sensor nodes have small
    power so energy consumption is the important one to increase the efficiency. The
    wireless sensor network is the combination of sensor nodes that contains the processor,
    power supply, memory, radio for transmission and an actuator these are used to
    make the communication over the network. Show All [9]There are so many types of
    sensor networks are available on the network. The tracking process is the responsible
    to track the route and provide the solution. The monitoring process s the type
    of sensor network which is used to monitor and control the network. The applications
    of the wireless sensor network are military, Environmental monitoring, Forest,
    Agriculture applications. SECTION II. Literature Review Here two failure detectors
    algorithms are developed for WSN. Based on that the process undergoes to find
    the first class level in the design of software for that system.[1] Here use quality
    of service to improve the network lifetime and provide the failure localization
    when there is any fault occurs in that network. [2] Provide an idea to detect
    the possible sub networks from the region utilized a quorum-based search and MCDS
    based movement mechanism. To improve the action decision by using the multi-radios
    on the actors then minimize the TMA performance. [3] Provide the Sensor Reading
    Validity Subservice (SRV) and Network Status Report subservice (NSR) this help
    to validate the sensor readings. Optimal service parameter is achieved. The failure
    detection of this technique is also done. [7] Provide the data aggregation with
    the polynomial based scheme to solve the problems of Event Region Detection (PERD).
    This technique is the responsible to detect the single event or multiple events
    continuously for that get the sensor readings based on the classification Normal
    reading, Event reading, Faulty readings and identify the faulty sensors and the
    proposed system is applied it to improve the partition of smaller parts of the
    sensor readings in the dataset using the elimination process of faulty readings.
    [8] This is the paper first present the self recovery process in the method of
    distributed partitioning algorithm to identify the partitioned network after some
    node failure made in the network. Here improve the efficiency of network by this
    approach to set relocating the faulty nodes by the mobile sensor nodes used to
    fix the partition made in the network after partitioning. [11] The fault can be
    static or dynamic then it classified based on the timing interval that may be
    permanent, intermittent. They propose the dynamic DSDP for the both soft and hard
    faults in the network. It provides the better mode of communication to increase
    the performance of a network. [12] The probabilistic fault detector for structured
    WSN, this proposed the novel approach by Centralized Naïve Bayes Detector between
    the end-end transmissions. [13] This paper proposes the adaptive partitioning
    in the link layer adds the error correction technique to increase the efficiency
    and minimize the retransmission. Analyzed the frame size and BER to increase the
    throughput. Here Logical link layer increases the efficiency by adds the FEC and
    frame partitioning. SECTION III. Proposed System A. The Zigbee Network Zigbee
    is the responsible to communicate the sensor nodes available on the agricultural
    field and it is useful to make a communication over long distance if use the zigbee
    series 1 then the distance responsible to cover 100m and for zigbee series 2 then
    the distance may be 150m for outdoor purpose. The indoor means that the coverage
    be reduced to 30m for both zigbee series 1 and series2. This is the effective
    one to make a wireless sensor network with sensors to sense the agricultural field
    and with the zigbee radio. The bandwidth of the zigbee maximum up to 250kbits/s.
    The zigbee network is capable to cover up to 100 to 1000s and the requirement
    be low that is also the efficiency to use the zigbee. Mainly it is useful for
    the monitoring application. This is useful to make mesh topology in the environment.
    Table 1: Characteristics of zigbee. B. Mesh Topology This wireless Mesh topology
    is the emerging one to develop the wireless sensor network as the efficient manner.
    It have the advantages like Self configuration, Self Healing and Scalability characteristics.
    This is the best topology when the number nodes increased on the sensor field
    and energy efficiency too. C. Fault Detection & Recovery The fault sensor nodes
    are identified based on some techniques and algorithm. The nodes are denoted as
    the combination of (V, E). In this the Node V failed or the edge between two nodes
    failed means the failure is occurred on the network. After that the graph become
    disconnected graph. Then the fault recovery process is needed to recover the network
    from the faulty nodes for that there are so many algorithms and techniques are
    implemented here to present the novel algorithm for the efficient fault detection
    topology design proposed. D. Proposed Algorithm E. Flow Diagram of the Proposed
    Algorithm Show All F. Algorithm Explanation The wireless sensor network for precision
    Agriculture application we propose the energy efficient fault tolerant topology
    with the CDS concept to increase the energy consumption process. First deploy
    all the sensors in the agricultural field and form it based on the efficient mesh
    topology format. Find the sink node that is based on the Connected Dominating
    Set algorithm. Here this procedure contains the parameter as Number of neighbor
    nodes available near to that node in the network, ID of the node and the high
    energy conservative node available in the network, based on these three parameter
    the CDS of the network will be calculated. Failure is the most challenging one
    to retrieve the network from that failure here we propose the novel EEFTT scheme
    based on that the failure is identified Node Failure: Find the degree sequence
    of every node available in the network. Degree Sequence means that the number
    nodes connected with that particular node. It is calculated for every defined
    time interval and it is checked with the previously calculated degree sequence
    and currently calculated degree sequence if there is any modification made on
    the value of the degree sequence then the node failure occurs on the network.
    Data Failure: After finishing the first one, then find data failure is available
    or not on the network. For that have to define the upper bound and lower bound
    value limit to the entire nodes available on the network. The retrieved sensor
    value is exceed or lower than the limit means the data failure occurs on the network
    is confirmed After fault identified then the recovery process it is done based
    on the bipartite graph concept The faulty nodes are placed in one set X and the
    remaining non faulty nodes are placed in a set Y. Then the faulty nodes are updated
    by the mobile relay nodes and the repeat all the steps from the topology design
    process SECTION IV. Conclusion The usage of wireless sensor network in precision
    agriculture is gaining a momentum in recent days. And with number of nodes which
    are spatially distributed increases, there is more probability that a node is
    getting affected and a node being compromised with faulty data. The algorithm
    we devised will definitely improve the fault tolerant capabilities of the existing
    network with the help of the fault detection and fault recovery method. SECTION
    V. Future Enhancement After As a future work we intend to simulate our algorithm
    with required performance metrics and compare them with existing algorithms. And
    also we have plans to implement the sensor network for precision agriculture with
    our low cost architecture. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

  description: Apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) is a measurement that correlates
    with soil properties that affect crop productivity, including soil texture, cation
    exchange capacity, drainage conditions, organic matter level, salinity, and subsoil
    characteristics. Consequently, information of ECa acquisition is significant to
    ensure the difference of the field parameters spatial distributing. Aiming at
    the existing problem of multi-sensor data fusion and mapping of soil properties
    with ECa, in this paper rough sets theory is used to deal with the multisensor
    datum in order to extract a hierarchy rule set for fusion, which has strong qualitative
    analysis ability. Meanwhile using support vector machine (SVM), reduced information
    is fused. In order to obtain optimum fusing accuracy, particle swarm optimization

    China SECTION I. Introduction XinJiang is an important farm production base in
    China, and it is an arid or semiarid region. The farm production environment is
    hostile and the water resource is very limited. Owing to the brittle environment,
    it stimulates the critical need for a decision system to rationally use the pesticide,
    fertilizer and water resource according to the crop requirement for improving
    the resource utility, avoiding the overrun of fertilizer and pesticide, avert
    the soil pollution, taking from the crop cost and increasing the crop yield and
    quality. A typical solution is a field monitoring system that can provide valuable
    data about land conditions, water usage backsupported by a capable data processing
    platform (data center) for analysis and interpretation in the entire crop growth
    process. Of the technical solutions that can provide such functionality are stand-alone
    sensor, with data loggers, and remote sensing via satellites [1]. The former needs
    manual data collection and the latter is restricted to shallow soil layers, less
    accurate and not suitable for real-time application[1]. The recent advances in
    micro-sensor technology and low-power analog/digital electronics, have led to
    the development of distributed, wireless networks of sensor devices [2]–[4]. Using
    the node embeded with various sensor, wireless sensor networks (WSN) can be used
    to apperceive, monitor and collect the phenomena data around our interested environment,
    and it even can use the collected data to get the full and exact information.
    The wireless communication mode of WSN make the network be deployed flexibly.
    The micro and vile node decrease the cost and avoid the influence to the crop
    operation. The sensor nodes deployed in the field, the full and accurate gotten
    crop enviroment information can be used to implement the feedback control, so
    the automation spray, dropping and fertilizer usage establishment can be implemented
    to alleviate the farms'' burden. Due to the mentioned advantages, WSN can be applied
    to monitoring the agricultural environment in order to implement the precision
    agriculture. At 2002, through achieving the grape grown information and carrying
    out the automatic irrigation by WSN, the Intel corporation had gained favorable
    fruit. With the development of WSN, the reseach on agricultural application has
    attracted more interesting in home and overseas experts, and some results have
    obtained [5]–[8]. But the research is still at its early development stage, there
    is not mature implement project at present. The remains of this paper is organized
    as follows. Section 2 describes the function and special requirements of the agriculture
    monitoring application in XinJiang farm. Section 3 presents the technical framework
    includes a two-layer architercture, an application-specific adaptable communication
    algorithm and a layer fault-tolerance mechanism. Section 4 discibes the conclusions
    and provides the concluding reamarks. SECTION II. The function and features of
    the WSN for XinJiang agricultural monitoring A. The function of the monitoring
    WSN The main function of WSN agriculture monitoring system is to accuratly detect
    the environment information of crop at entire grown process on moisture, temperature,
    salt, pesticide, soil stain and soil fertility in the glasshouse, crop, nursery,
    grassland orahard and etc. It aims at providing the scientific decision-making
    gist for the precision agriculture. The concrete function includes: Apperceive,
    collecting and diposal environment data. Each sensor node deployed in the filed
    is in charge of collecting the soil moistrure, temperature data around itself
    in real-time. Remote data transmission. Detected data should be transferred to
    the sink node quickly. After receiving and integrating the data, the sink node
    transmits the disposed data through Internet to remote data center. Then based
    on it the expert can analyze and make right crop production operation decision.
    Remote Network management. In the system runtime, there is no nessary to work
    at the locale besides the setup stage and the node substitute stage. The system
    can access and control WSN through Internet. B. The features and challenges of
    the XinJiang agricultural monitoring WSN system The heart of such monitoring system
    is sensor technology which provides the appropriate means by which physical phenoment
    is properly captured. Moreover, the WSNs design paradigms tend to be mostly application-specific.
    So the special requirement about WSN must be analyzed due to the special production
    environment in XinJiang. Scalability and scarce deployment. In XinJiang each unit
    farmland or orchard exceeds several tens of acres, so the monitoring system should
    be scalable. To resolve the energy confine question the typical WSN is comprised
    of a large number of sensor nodes, which is densely deployed either inside the
    phenomenon or very close to it. But in XinJiang all resources such as water, fertilizer
    and pesticide is provided by man, the farm production cost is quite high. If the
    monitoring WSN is deployed in the typical way, the farm production cost will be
    intolerability. So the XinJiang agricultural monitoring system should be advance
    scarcely deployed. The typical densely deployment has many redundance nodes and
    the WSN is prone to implement the asleep/active method and energy-saving communication
    protocol. However the scarcely deployment can''t use these mechanisms straightway.
    The variable monitoring cycle. Typical WSN has higher and fixed monitoring frequency.
    But the metric of agricultural environment has extensive range, the monitoring
    cycle can''t be fixed. The sample rate should be adjusted according to the application
    data. When the situation of soil is all right, the system should setup a longer
    cycle; when the situation is dispatch, the system cycle should be reduced to bring
    the alarm signal. The long network lifetime. In XinJiang the agricultural monitoring
    WSN lifetime should be attained to the 4~6 months to meet the monitoring requirement
    at the entire crop grown process. It is an galactic challenge to deploy the WSN
    which is satisfy to the agricultural monitoring lifetime requirement at the situation
    of scarcely deployment mode. Fault-tolerance and few manoperation. The node in
    WSN is tread away inevitably due to the limited power and intricate environment.
    To ensure reliability, the monitoring WSN should monitor the system status and
    use some fault-tolerate method. Owing to the scability, the disable node is substituted
    frequently by farm is infeasible. The precondition of the agricultural monitoring
    WSN is accepted by the farm is that the network must carry out the methods of
    detecting disable nodes and exception handles progress. SECTION III. The technology
    framework of the XinJiang agricultural monitoring WSN The technology framework
    about the XinJiang agricultural monitoring WSN is deployed based on the challenges
    of it''s special environment. In this framework a new two-layer deployment method,
    an appliction correlation adaptable communication arithmetic and a layer fault-tolerance
    idea are introduced. A. Two-layer architecture In mentioned requirement, the sensor
    nodes should be scarcely deployed in advance. The two layer architecture which
    consists of heterogeneous nodes is provided for the scability, reliability, veracity
    and network connectivity. The basic deployment is showed by Fig. 1. The monitoring
    area is divided into several clusters which is composed of a number of normal
    nodes for monitoring soil information and a cluster header node for transmiting
    data. The communication range of normal nodes is 40~70m and the nodes accord the
    ZigBee standard. The communication range of central cluster headers is about 250m.
    It is equipped with bulky battery. The normal nodes transfer the collection data
    to cluster header node by one hop way. Then the data will be integrated and transferred
    to the Sink node through multihop. At last the Sink node transmits the integrated
    information to remote data center. Figure 1: The monitoring system Show All It
    is assumed according to the network architecture.① The farm is plain and no balk
    to communicate. ②The cluster headers have stronger capability on computation,
    storage, power and communication.③ The Sink node has unlimited capability, it
    can communicate with remote data center through GPRS.④ Each normal node has the
    same capability and it''s communication radius is r. Each cluster headers has
    same capability too and it''s maximum communication is R. The basic topology structure
    of system shows in Fig. 1 too. The WSN includes two-layer. The bottom layer is
    composed of normal detecting nodes and a cluster header node. The function of
    bottom layer is to collect and intergrate the soil environment data of each cluster.
    In this layer, the monitoring area should be covered by the normal nodes fully.
    From the research results of [9]–[11], it is known that the monitoring area can
    be covered seamless and need least number of nodes when the nodes form trangle
    or rhombus. So we deploy the normal node in the light of Fig. 2. In this figure,
    each circulary indicates the communication range. The acme of the trangle is the
    position of detecting node. The length of trangle border is 3 – √ r . The upper
    layer is comprised of all cluster headers, Sink and GPRS. The function of upper
    layer is to process the data transmission, system detection and management functions.
    Owing to the scability, the cluster headers can''t transfer data to sink by one
    hop. So all the cluster headers should team up to form multihop multipath. If
    the cluster headers distributed evenly, the node near the sink transmits more
    packets than other cluster heads, its power is probably used up earlier than other
    nodes too. These disable nodes will lead to the network disable. The error must
    be resolved manually in order to make the syster work continueously. To reduce
    the number of man-operation, the energy of all cluster headers should be proportionally
    used up. So we deploy cluster headers with unevenly way. The communication range
    of the cluster headers is conformed by the distance to the sink node and the packets
    transmitted. The nearer the node distance to the sink and more packets it processes
    the shorter communication range should be mounted. So the nodes near the sink
    consumes much less energy to communication each packet. Through deploying the
    network in terms of the optimization model between the communication power and
    the amount of the transmission, all of cluster headers has close lifetime and
    the manual opertion can be reduced. The deployment mechanism of the cluster header
    node is showed in Fig. 3. The center of the squre is the position of the cluster
    header node. The circumcircle shows the communication range of cluster header.
    The normal nodes in the square belong to a cluster. Figure 2 the deployment of
    the normal nodes Show All Figure 3: the deployment of cluster headers Show All
    B. The adpatable application-specific communication protocol In sensor node the
    RF module is the most power hungry. The deployment of energy-saving communication
    to meet the application requirement is the key to resolve the question about network
    longevity and limited node capability. Based on the arithmetic of Parameter-Energy-Environment
    aware Task Scheduling in literature [12], a new adpatable application-specific
    communication algorith is provided in this framework. The main idea is to dynamically
    schedule the sensor to work based on the content and variability of collection
    application data. Hereby the asleep/active time of nodes can be intercalated accordingly.
    The proposed mechanism uses three parameter: the alarm threshold which is used
    to show that the farm enters into aridity or innutritious status and collection
    cycle should be reduced quickly; the kilter threshold which is showed the farm
    enters into benign status and the collection cycles should be increased and the
    node sleep time should be prolonged; The basic sampling rates which is a stardard
    to schedule the cycle time. All of the three parameter should be setup from an
    point of agricultural expert''s view. Initially all the nodes work according to
    the basic sampling rates. Exploit to the profile history over a reasonable amount
    of time to refine the sampling rate accordingly. When the integrated cluster data
    reaches alarm threshold, the sampling rate should be started to increase, in this
    way the situation can be found and processed by remote data center quickly. When
    the data attains the kilter threshold, the sampling rate could be reduced accordingly
    so as to avoid negative propagation conditions, hence keeping the transmission
    power on its possible minimum. The schedule direction is based on the data variational
    direction and the schedule degree is based on the variational grade. For example,
    the soil is at the good status and the variational value shows that the situation
    will get into better, so the sampling rate can be scheduled to be longer. This
    scheduling mechanism could be implemented in the cluster header or in the sink
    node or even in the remote data center. For moving the processing burden to the
    external server and network coordinator node, it can be mostly implemented in
    remote data center. The data center computes the each cluster sampling rate based
    on the collected information, then transmit the information to the sink node through
    GPRS, the sink node broadcasts the messages then each node will collect, integrate
    or transfer soil data accordingly. C. The layered fault-tolerance mechanism The
    function of node detection and network self-management must be deployed for the
    WSN reliability. When the netwok has the venial error, the WSN should start to
    function the repair module to make the WSN work continuously. At the same time,
    the error message should be reported to the data center. If the error is serious,
    the report should be arrived at remote data center as soon as possible. Based
    on the two-layer architecture, the fault-tolerant can be implemented layed too.
    The function of bottom network. The cluster header monitor the status of normal
    nodes in cluster. Any node hasn''t transmited data for three cycles, the cluster
    header deduces that the node is abate. So the disable node information should
    be reported to the Sink and the sink reports to the remote data center too. The
    upper netwok. The sink node infers the status of the cluster headers by the recevied
    data. If a disable cluster header is found, the sink node will command the around
    cluster header nodes boost their transmission power to make the network work temporarily,
    at the same time the sink node report this situation to remote data center. If
    a number of disable cluster headers are found, the sink node must report the situation
    to data center quickly and wait for deadling with. SECTION IV. CONCLUSION The
    technology framework for agricultural monitoring WSN is provided based on the
    features, requirements and the challenges in XinJiang farm environment. A new
    two-layer heterogeneous architecture, the adpatable application-specific communication
    protocol and the layered fault-tolerance mechanism are proposed in this paper
    to resolve the question of scability, reliability and the cost in WSN. The algorithms
    and the mechanisms of proposed framework need be extensively studied, the function
    and the impact in fact should be tested and verified more. Authors Figures References

    Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Government agencies, public institutions,
    and private companies in India have worked over six decades to empower Bottom
    of the Pyramid (BoP) or rural communities through various policies and interventions.
    Eighty-five percent of these technological interventions failed to create an impact
    as they lacked a holistic approach, scalability, sustainability, and effective
    interagency coordination. This paper discusses the successful implementation of
    interventions through Amrita University''s Live-in-Labs™ program and proposes
    a model that ensures a co-design environment to develop technology-based interventions
    for rural development. The model aims to create a virtual ecosystem that will
    enable field practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders
    to plan, design, implement, and review scalable and sustainable interventions.
    The paper describes the key components of the model and investigates the sustainability,
    scalability, and impact of the technology interventions in the program''s five
    main thematic areas - Infrastructure & Basic Facilities, Health & Livelihood,
    Education & Technology, Energy, and Environment & Farming - through a case study.

    Seattle, WA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Approximately 70 percent of India''s
    population lives in rural areas where dependence on a fragile and unpredictable
    agricultural system has left many individuals socially and economically marginalized.
    Furthermore, the agricultural sector''s contribution to the country''s GDP has
    steadily declined over the past few years, crippling the flow of income and spiraling
    many rural communities into a perpetual life of poverty. In research publication
    [1], R. Chambers attempts to study and explain rural poverty from the view of
    academicians and field practitioners. However, he has come to the conclusion that
    both groups have shortcomings as academics are isolated from the real world and
    field practitioners have a limited focus. Therefore, there is a need to come up
    with a third perspective, involving “people and places” in conjunction with the
    previous two [1]. Combining these three perspectives, this paper proposes the
    Rapid Translational Research and Implementation model, derived from Amrita University''s
    Live-in-Labs™ program, which integrates academia, practical field work, and the
    “third perspective” to develop technology-based interventions for rural communities.
    Now and in the future, it is imperative that researchers and field practitioners
    appropriately incorporate Chambers'' “third perspective” - that is utilizing participatory
    approaches for rural development. While participatory approaches have been adopted
    by many government agencies and public and private organizations, they have not
    been fully evaluated in the broader context of “who is using them, how, and what
    for” [2]–[4]. The current paper observes the degree and nature of participatory
    involvement in Amrita University''s Live-in-Labs™ program and proposes a model
    that ensures a codesign environment to develop and successfully implement technology-based
    interventions. In many developing nations, government organizations have partnered
    with educational institutions to address challenges faced in rural communities
    and initiate programs in rural development. For example, the Government of India
    has established Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) centers in collaboration
    with prominent Indian technology institutes [5]. The RuTAG centers “help disseminate
    technology interventions and upgrade existing ones by clearly defining problems
    and providing solutions” [5]. As the centers are primarily established in partnership
    with technology institutes, there is a lack of a holistic perspective to conduct
    research, to design solutions, and to implement technology interventions. We observed
    that challenges faced by rural communities were multifaceted and complex yet were
    often addressed from single or top-down approaches. E. F. Schumacher supports
    this view by proposing the use of “Appropriate Technology” and technology interventions
    that are highly customized, taking into consideration many factors related to
    a rural community [6]. The D-Lab program, which provides interdisciplinary courses
    to those working towards technology development for community welfare, has developed
    two frameworks for research [7]. The Lean Research Framework provides a methodology
    to guide and improve the practice of field research with people and communities
    by better understanding the impact of various program interventions [8]. The User
    Research framework is a methodology for collecting information from users and
    stakeholders in order to enhance technology interventions and to create products
    that meet the needs of targeted communities [9]. Dr. Jeffrey D. Sachs proposed
    a millennium village program where he offered internships for students in 12 sites
    spread across 10 African villages [10]. Even though the programs were able to
    successfully send students to address challenges in communities, the program did
    not attempt to understand the multifaceted nature of challenges (e.g. sanitation).
    Addressing the shortcomings in the existing models and the gaps experienced while
    implementing these models adopted to develop interventions for rural development,
    we propose the Rapid Translational Research and Implementation (RTRI) model. In
    an effort to integrate multidisciplinary academic theory, practical experience,
    and co-designing, we developed a multidisciplinary experiential learning program
    called Live-in-Labs™ [11]. The program is the creation of Amrita University''s
    Chancellor Sri. Mata Amritanandamayi Devi. She first proposed the program during
    a speech at the University at Buffalo (USA) in 2012 [12]. She stated: As part
    of our university curricula, students should spend time in such communities [villages].
    We should provide them with the opportunity to observe the lives of the people
    who live there-their struggles and hardships. Students should interact with them
    and listen to their problems. This will provide them with insight into aspects
    of life that otherwise would remain concealed to them. In turn when our students
    attain the success and positions of power they seek, the experiences they gained
    in these agricultural communities will remain with them and impact the decisions
    and policies they put into action. This idea sparked a large initiative at Amrita
    University, and under the Chancellor''s guidance, the Live-in-Labs™ program came
    into existence. In her United Nations address in 2015 [13], she stated: Today,
    universities and researchers are ranked mainly based on the amount of funding
    they receive, the number of papers they publish and their intellectual caliber.
    Faculty are promoted according to the same criteria as well. Along with this,
    we should take into consideration how much we have been able to use their research
    to serve the lowest and most vulnerable strata of society. Live-in-Labs™ aims
    to address current challenges and develop sustainable technology-based innovations
    for rural development. This program attempts to bridge the existing gaps aforementioned
    by focusing on the multifaceted nature of challenges, through multi-level interventions
    co-designed with community engagement along with university faculty, researchers,
    and students. Since 2014, the program has been implemented in approximately 60
    villages throughout India, generating over 50 interventions, many of which yielded
    spinoff interventions. After implementing these interventions and subsequently
    evaluating their efficacy, we propose the RTRI model as an effective guide to
    developing a holistic and successful program that generates technology-based solutions
    for rural development. The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows:
    Section II introduces the Live-in-Labs™ program; Section III presents our case
    study; Section IV delineates the Rapid Translational Research and Implementation
    (RTRI) Model; Section V describes the outcomes of the multi-phase interventions
    through the Live-in-Labs™ program; and Section VI presents our conclusion. SECTION
    II. About Live-in-Labs™ Amrita University''s Live-in-Lab™ program isa multidisciplinary
    theory-into-practice initiative that facilitates the research, development, and
    deployment of sustainable technology based solutions for current challenges faced
    by rural communities (villages) in India. Through experiential learning opportunities,
    participants 1 from multiple disciplines can study, observe, and interact with
    villagers while living in rural communities to gain a better understanding of
    challenges in the five thematic areas: Health & Livelihood, Education & Technology,
    Environment & Farming, Energy, and Infrastructure & Basic Facilities. Villages
    participating in the Live-in-Labs™ program were adopted by the Mata Amritanandamayi
    Math2 (M.A. Math) under a program titled Amrita SeRVe. A. Self-Reliance of a Village
    The main goal of the Live-in-Labs™ program is to empower villages to become self-reliant
    and sustainable. The path to self-reliance is realized through multiple interventions
    in the five thematic areas mentioned above. These areas can further be classified
    as a combination of challenges, with each challenge subsequently linked to a combination
    of problems. A diagram representing the conceptual path to a village''s self-reliance
    is seen in Figure 2.1 below. In the figure, TA stands for thematic area, Ch stands
    for challenges that make up a thematic area, and P stands for problems that fall
    under a particular challenge. Figure 2.1: Conceptual path to self-reliance of
    a village Show All For instance, in the thematic area of Health & Livelihood,
    one of the challenges could be malnutrition, another challenge could be lack of
    proper sanitation, and yet another challenge could be disproportionate dissemination
    of health-related information. These challenges can further be broken down into
    everyday observable problems. For example, problems leading to malnutrition could
    be due to the combination of any of the following: scarcity of food and water,
    contaminated water, lack of awareness about diet requirements to achieve proper
    levels of nutrition, and insufficient income to purchase healthy, nutritious food.
    Therefore, to make a village self-reliant with respect to even one challenge,
    we need to address each of the problems mentioned above. B. Problem Identification
    The strength of the Live-in-Labs™ program lies in the ability to leverage theoretical
    knowledge from multiple disciplines to address these challenges. The participants
    of this program travel to these remote villages and live with the villagers to
    facilitate cultural immersion and to understand and identify the problems. These
    cultural immersions provided the opportunity to analyze the problems with respect
    to the villagers'' local culture, social customs and behaviors. Based on this
    analysis, participants are able to prioritize the problemsand identify major social,
    economic, engineering and managerial constraints to be integrated in the design
    of the solution. C. Integration of Interdisciplinary Research We observed that
    almost all the problems identified in a village cannot be solved using the knowledge
    of one discipline. Indeed, the strength of the Live-in-Labs™ program lies in the
    ability to leverage theoretical knowledge from multiple disciplines to address
    the challenges. In each of the identified problems, the participants from multiple
    disciplines model and identify the engineering and research challenges, study
    the multidisciplinary involvement needed to address those challenges, and assess
    which combination of disciplines will produce the greatest degree of sustainability
    and self-reliance. Based on this knowledge, the participants form interdisciplinary
    groups to provide solutions for the village. For example, if lack of proper sanitation
    is identified as a challenge in a particular village, then researchers, field
    experts, and students from the fields of civil engineering, biotechnology, health
    care, and social work will work together to devise a sustainable and cost-effective
    solution in collaboration with village residents. This way, a challenge is addressed
    more holistically as a result of this multi-pronged approach. D. Phased Implementation
    To ensure the effectiveness, sustainability, scalability, and acceptance of proposed
    technology interventions, participants introduce solutions in phases, which is
    described in detail in the case study in Section III. In the phased implementations,
    the participants (1) implemented and tested their pilot interventions, (2) monitored
    their impact on the village and its residents (3) received feedback, (4) proposed
    new solutions thereby, readdressing a particular challenge, and (5) enhanced or
    fine-tuned technology interventions to better meet the needs of villagers. For
    example, in Orissa, there was widespread open defecation and lack of awareness
    about proper sanitation practices. To address this issue, participants began teaching
    village women masonry skills and how to build toilets. Even after toilets were
    constructed, participants noticed that villagers were not utilizing them. They
    later discovered that lack of access to water was one of the prime reasons villagers
    were not using the constructed toilets. Therefore, participants phased the construction
    of toilets to accommodate a water distribution project. The design, development
    and implementation of the water distribution project also addressed many other
    challenges. Once the first phase of the water distribution project was over, the
    degree of impact of the sanitation project increased considerably. This phased
    approach provided the opportunity for participants to assess the adoption of the
    proposed technology interventions, to understand the inherent problems, propose
    new solutions, and develop faster methods to diffuse different technologies and
    solutions for the betterment of the community. This approach also ensured adherence
    to any cultural or legal dimensions and enabled participants and villagers to
    engage in collaborative decision-making. Finally, this approach facilitated capacity
    building among villagers in the maintenance of adopted technologies and/or in
    the delivery of services related to technological interventions. E. Rural Managemen
    Platform (rmp) The effectiveness of a phased approach used in the Live-in-Labs™
    program is dependent on the interagency coordination of participants and villagers.
    The RMP provides the basis for this interagency coordination. The platform is
    a 24/7 user-friendly software that supplies virtual connectivity to all program
    sites (villages),thereby fostering communication between research teams throughout
    the Live-in-Labs™ program. The platform stores and processes data generated from
    various research activities; provides a constant, multidirectional flow of information
    that can be easily stored and accessed anytime and anyplace, and disseminates
    centralized information that is collected from periodic reports and meetings.
    The platform also helps model current challenges faced by rural communities, enables
    remote monitoring and assessment of pilot deployments, and functions as a regulatory
    system that ensures all participants work in accordance with the rules and regulations
    stipulated by the program. Fig 2.1 shows the Rural Management Platform. SECTION
    III. Case Study: Live-in-Labs™ Program at Vallaramkunnu Village Participants visited
    one of the remote tribal villages-Vallaramkunnu - which is located on top of a
    small mountain in the Wayanad district of Kerala. The village has a population
    of about300 people and is comprised of four tribes spread across 43 houses. The
    majority of houses have one room with athatched roof and mud walls. The villagers
    cannot afford electricity and hence depend on wood for cooking and kerosene lamps
    for lighting. Depending on scarce labor opportunities available nearby, the village
    is subjected to extreme poverty coupled with alcoholism and substance abuse. School
    dropout rates are as high as 80 percent, and women are deprived of income opportunities.
    Participants also observed that poor health and hygiene has a significant economic
    impact on the lives of the villagers. Fig. 2.1 Rural management platform in live-in-labs™
    program Show All Based on the needs of the village, Live-in-Labs™ participants
    identified key challenge areas where technology interventions could be applied.
    During their stay of more than a week, participants engaged very closely with
    villagers and identified several problems such as high dropout rates from schools,
    substance abuse, lack of work skills, low income generation, contaminated drinking
    water, unprofitable farming practices, poor sanitation practices, and restricted
    access to and lack of energy for home lighting and cooking. Even though there
    were several problems, the participants prioritized the problems based on their
    understanding of the village''s needs. Participants allocated the highest priority
    to providing a solution for restricted access to energy since it is the fundamental
    requirement to provide further solutions for the villagers. The interventions
    implemented in the five thematic areas, the disciplines involved, the number of
    participants, and the number of phases of each intervention, as of 2016, is shown
    in Table I below. Fig. 3.1 shows the 30-month timeline progression of the eight
    technology interventions in the relevant thematic areas implemented in Vallaramkunnu.
    The percentage of community participation for each intervention is also shown.
    Interventions 1 - 8 represented in Table I are reflected in Fig. 3.1. Table 1.
    Live-In-LabsTM technology interventions implemented in vallaramkunnu The vertical
    axis of Fig. 3 represents the phased progression of the various interventions
    whereas the horizontal axis shows the timeline in three-month intervals. The thickness
    of the progression line represents community participation. Multi-thematic interventions
    (e.g., Intervention 5 and 6) are represented by the broken progression line. The
    secondary thematic area is represented by the color of the intervention number.
    The black grid line above Phase 1: Design represents the base line for interventions.
    Fig. 3.1: Timeline of technology interventions with phases Show All Intervention
    1 in Phase 1 was deployed for 2 months, and Phase 2 deployment was completed in
    8 months. More time was spent on design and deployment because interventions 3
    and 4 served the same beneficiaries. The change in the slope of Intervention l''s
    Phase 2 progression line shows the interdependencies of Interventions 3 and 4.
    A further change in slope is observed for Intervention 1 when Intervention 2 progressed
    to Phase 1 Deployment. No studies have been performed on the causal impact of
    the mutual interdependency of interventions. More than 75% of the community participated
    for all interventions in all phases whether during or post-deployment. Interventions
    6 and 7 did not progress to Phase 2. Some interventions (1, 2, and 3) started
    with research and then subsequently moved into the design and implementation phase
    of the intervention. Based on the impact on the community, the research, design,
    and re-deployment was phased (e.g., Intervention 4, Intervention 6, and Intervention
    8). The Live-in-Labs™ program was able to address the community''s challenges
    and deploy technology interventions within 24 months. SECTION IV. Rapid Translational
    Research and Implementation (rtri) Model Based on our experience with the Live-in-Labs™
    program, a holistic model named as Rapid Translational Research and Implementation
    (RTRI) model was proposed. This model enables the application of technology for
    rural development as a systematic matching of the supply and demand process driven
    by a continuous flow and exchange of information. A key theme of the RTRI model
    is interagency coordination - a multi-level, multi-channel system of sharing and
    communicating, implementing and testing, and monitoring and assessing research,
    resources, and technology. This multidimensional model facilitates the development
    and effective implementation of customized, scalable, and sustainable technological
    solutions to foster rural development. The model is divided into four cells3:
    Multidisciplinary Innovation Cell, Experiential Learning Cell, Implementation
    and Performance Cell, and Services Cell. Figure 4.1 shows a visual representation
    of the model. Fig. 4.1: Rapid translational research and implementation (rtri)
    model Show All A. Multidisciplinary Innovation Cell This cell is a network of
    methodologies that: Deconstructs a given set of challenges into smaller units
    Reconstructs these initial challenges into an entirely new set of challenges that
    are manageable Assesses and evaluates the flexibility, capacity, and degree of
    leverage of the various disciplines involved In this cell, methodologies revolve
    around identifying challenges from multiple fields or multiple perspectives, thereby
    generating a holistic approach to proposing interventions rather than a unidimensional
    perspective. Inputs from multiple disciplines increase the chances of developing
    sustainable and scalable technology interventions for rural development. Figure
    4.1.1 shows a practical application of the cell. B. Experiential Learning Cell
    This cell is a network of methodologies that map the attributes of technological
    demands of rural communities in accordance with the community''s rationale for
    rural development. The cell also focuses on: Establishing a frame of reference
    Selecting a proper scale Fig. 4.1.1: Multidisciplinary innovation cell in live-in-labs™
    program Show All Here methodologies focus on the development of technology interventions
    in collaboration with rural populations by engaging in community immersion activities
    that help identify challenges, assess priorities, and acknowledge concerns of
    local residents. Figure 4.1.2 shows a practical application of the cell. Fig.
    4.1.2: Experiential learning cell in live-in-labs™ program Show All C. Implementation
    & Performance Cell This cell is a network of methodologies in pursuit of identifying
    the optimal equilibrium point of technology-based interventions for rural development.
    The cell also focuses on: Phased4 implementation of technology interventions Continuous
    profiling of parameters Impact assessment of externalities on equilibrium Here
    methodologies are used to test, assess, and monitor technology interventions by
    implementing them in phases, making sure proposed interventions reflect the demands
    and address the concerns of the community in need. The methodologies also evaluate
    technology interventions for sustainability and scalability and how well they
    have adhered to social, cultural, economic, and environmental standards. Figure
    4.1.3 shows a practical application of the cell. Fig. 4.1.3: Implementation &
    performance cell in live-in-labs™ program Show All D. Service Cell This cell is
    a network of methodologies that creates an ecosystem for the continuous exchange
    of knowledge and resources among disciplines, actors5, and externalities while
    also coding and archiving events6. The methodologies in this cell primarily focus
    on the management and sharing of knowledge and resources and disseminating centralized
    information for easy accessibility anytime, anyplace. Figure 2.1 shows a practical
    application of the cell (Rural Management Platform). SECTION V. Outcomes of Multi-Phase
    Interventions Through Live-in-Labs™ program Multi-phase interventions through
    the Live-in-Labs™ program have been implemented in 60 villages since its inception
    in 2014. These interventions show the efficacy of the RTRI model. Some of the
    measured outcomes are given below: A. Knowledge Outcome Based on extensive research,
    the Live-in-Labs™ program was able to implement over 50 interventions, many of
    which created sub-intreventions or spin-off interventions. The Phase 3 Research
    of solar electrification produced spin-off interventions such as a Real-Time Monitoring
    System of Energy Generation and Distribution as well as Distributed Real-Time
    Energy Management Algorithms for a Sustainable Micro-Grid. The total number of
    interventions for all thematic areas, inlcuding spin-offs, is 168. B. Tools Outcome
    The Rural Management Platform was created to facilitate virtual connectivity to
    all program sites (villages), thereby fostering communication between research
    teams throughout the Live-in-Labs™ program. In the next three to four years, we
    would like the software platform to monitor the progress of proposed interventions,
    communicate with collaborating partners, and disseminate information with all
    beneficiaries. Currently, 62% of the beneficiaries have been connected to the
    platform. We hope to achieve 100% connectivity in the future. C. Training Outcome
    One thousand undergraduate and postgraduate domestic 7 and international students
    have participated in the program. These students have helped address challenges
    and proposed solutions at different phases for various periods of time. The following
    are a few quotes from past participants. “When you are working with the people,
    you really get to know where you are as opposed to being a foreigner who has been
    transplanted there. Thus, I found this to be one of the most valuable trips, and
    I would definitely like to come back and continue the work I did.” (Meghan Gates,
    MFA Fine Arts, University of Maryland, USA, 2014). “This program is overwhelmingly
    positive and I give it my personal recommendation. Not only was I able to experience
    the amazing and tantalizing culture of India, but I was able to observe and immerse
    myself in the remote tribal villages of Southern India. I was able to grow as
    a person while fostering friendships and bridging my cultural understanding of
    how societies organize and operate.” (Brandon Arkinson, B.A. Disability Studies,
    Ryerson University, Canada, 2015). D. Outreach Outcome Participants of the program
    have clocked over 200,000 hours of direct engagement with rural communities. The
    following is a list of areas where technology interventions were successfully
    implemented with the respective number of beneficiories: Interventions related
    to water were implemented in 3 villages with 2,700 direct beneficiaries: a water
    distribution system which provides tap water to households, water filters to improve
    the water to schools and community centers, and health centers and women-based
    awareness programs on water quality and testing. Interventions related to energy
    were implemented in 2 villages with 600 direct beneficiaries: rural electrification,
    initiation of new community-based businesses, powering a water distribution system,
    powering tuition centers, and integration of multiple micro grids for effective
    energy management. Interventions related to education were implemented in 41 villages
    with 1,150 direct beneficiaries: separate programs for school children, adults,
    women, and youth. Interventions related to sanitation were implemented in 30 villages
    with 850 direct beneficiaries: building toilets, an awareness program, lighting
    toilets, and nudging (encourage the adoption of a new idea or practice into a
    community). Interventions to aid income generation had 390 direct beneficiaries:
    lemon grass distillation unit, tailoring unit, craft manufacturing unit, metal
    crafts, sanitary napkin manufacturing unit, and automated irrigation systems.
    Interventions related to health care had 2,500 direct beneficiaries: wearable
    diagnostic tools and awareness programs. E. Leverage Outcome The program has had
    participants from 15 international universities where international students and
    researchers collaborated with students, faculty members, and researchers from
    Amrita University. These collaborations enabled leveraging knowledge and resources
    from around the world to design and successfully implement customized, low cost
    technology-based interventions in various rural communities and to conduct the
    appropriate research on these interventions. F. Sustainability Outcome On average,
    50% of rural villagers participated where the program had a presence for more
    than three months. Since the solutions made use of renewable and locally available
    resources (including skilled and unskilled labor), the cost of interventions were
    lower compared to the alternatives. For example, as a result of the rural sanitation
    program, more than 300 women are now skilled in building and maintaining toilets
    for their homes. The interventions were created with the goal of lowering maintenance
    costs to village residents through the use of local resources. The overall cost
    of maintenance and cost of capacity building were also lower. Similar interventions
    have been implemented in phases in all the adopted villages in the program, leading
    to a framework of best practices to help scale technology based interventions
    for rural communities in general. Further notable outcomes of the Live-in-Labs™
    program are: The participation-based implementation of the micro water distribution
    systems in villages in Rajasthan (located in western India) and Orissa (located
    in eastern India). The Live-in-Labs™ program enabled the entire system to become
    operational at a cost of $0.20 per person per month. Development and adoption
    of wearable health care diagnostic tools in a village in West Bengal. The direct
    beneficiaries of the 65 interventions were over 2,800 people (30% of the village
    residents). The indirect beneficiaries were over 6,000 people (more than 55% of
    village residents). The greatest impact of the interventions was observed in the
    latter phases. SECTION VI. Conclusion The practical application and successful
    implementation of technology interventions for rural development is realized through
    the Live-in-Labs™ program, which has yielded the RTRI model. Through phased implementations
    of technology interventions, the impact, sustainability, scalability, and acceptance
    of proposed solutions were measured, evaluated, and monitored by program participants.
    This approach also allowed participants to receive feedback from and collaborate
    with rural residents on interventions. In addition, the program enabled participants
    to reassess interventions and propose new ones or enhance proposed interventions
    to better meet the needs of the villagers. This paper discussed the various technology
    interventions implemented in the village of Vall aramkunnu, providing a breakdown
    of the phases of implementation over a period of 30 months. The paper discussed
    major milestones of the Live-in-Labs™ program since it commenced. The RTRI model,
    derived from the Live-in-Labs™ program, has proven to be effective in blending
    theoretical knowledge, practical field experience, and community participation
    to successfully implement technology-based interventions for rural development.

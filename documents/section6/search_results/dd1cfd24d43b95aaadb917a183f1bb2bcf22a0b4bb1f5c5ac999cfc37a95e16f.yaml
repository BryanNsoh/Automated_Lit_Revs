    resources around the globe has generated a need for their optimum utilization.
    Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors’
    data acquisition and intelligent processing, are bridging the gaps between the
    cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation management systems can help
    in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in the precision farming landscape.
    This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the
    irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather
    forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and
    environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The
    intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers
    sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air
    temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been
    developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly
    collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization
    and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision
    for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation
    scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information
    processing results of three weeks data based on the proposed algorithm. The system
    is fully functional and the prediction results are very encouraging. Previous

    Water scarcity is already affecting a part of the world and the situation is getting
    worse over time due to the increasing world population and fresh water demands.
    The current world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to be more
    than 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2013). The agriculture sector, particularly
    irrigation, consumes a major portion of the freshwater. Due to lack of cost-effective
    intelligent irrigation systems, developing countries are consuming more water
    in contrast to the developed countries for achieving the same yield. For example,
    India has approximately 4% of world’s freshwater resources to serve 17% of the
    world population; however, it takes 2–4 times more water for some of its major
    agri-produce in comparison to the other countries like China, USA (G. o. I. NITI
    Aayog, 2015). Therefore, there is a dire need to come up with advanced technologies
    based smart strategies and systems for effective utilization of fresh water. Gubbi
    et al. (2013) discussed an IoT framework with cloud centric storage, processing
    and analysis of the data received from ubiquitous sensors along with a decision
    support interface. Cruz et al. (2018) suggested a reference model for an IoT middleware
    platform that would support intelligent IoT applications. IoT based solutions
    are proving very helpful in many dimensions of the agricultural landscape (Sharma
    et al., 2016), and these intelligent solutions could also be fruitful in smart
    irrigation with optimum utilization of water. Soil moisture, precipitation, and
    evaporation are the essential parameters for designing a smart irrigation system.
    The precipitation and evaporation are important key factors, which influence the
    soil moisture. In geography and climatology, the wetness of soil is estimated
    by the proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation and evaporation (Shang
    et al., 2007). Daily soil moisture can also be evaluated by the ratio of daily
    precipitation and evaporation in the above perspective. Precipitation is directly
    accessible in the routine weather reports; nonetheless, evaporation can be calculated
    using other metrological essentials. For evaporation, we use an empirical model
    given by Penman (Chen and Chen, 1993) (1) The entire evaporation depends on the
    thermodynamic evaporation and the dynamic evaporation , where depends upon the
    velocity of the land storm, air temperature, relative humidity of the air and
    UV radiation. To achieve water saving, irrigation system frameworks have been
    proposed based on various techniques, e.g., thermal imaging, Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI), direct soil water measurements, etc. Thermal imaging is a prominent
    technique for irrigation management and it is based on the shade temperature distribution
    of the plant. In this framework, the status of the water in the plant is checked
    over continuous intervals and irrigation is planned in view of the shade temperature
    distribution of the plant (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, CWSI based framework
    has been proposed for irrigation scheduling of the crops for efficient use of
    water. The observation of CWSI was first characterized more than 30 years ago
    (Idso et al., 1981). O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) proposed an automatic irrigation
    scheduling based on direct soil water measurement that utilizes water proficiently
    over manual irrigation system. Allen et al. (1998) suggested evapotranspiration
    (ET) based approach, which is an important parameter to decide crop irrigation
    needs influenced by climate parameters, e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity,
    temperature, wind velocity, and crop features such as phase of the crop growth,
    assortment and plant density, properties of soil, nuisance, and disease control.
    ET-based frameworks can save water up to 42% over time-based water irrigation
    scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Davis et al. (2009) conducted the investigations
    in Florida and verified that ET‐based watering scheduling controllers are more
    beneficial in term of cost, size and labor requirement for irrigation. ET-based
    irrigation system uses much less water as compared to scheduled practices. Viani
    et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy logic-based decision support system based on farmer’s
    experience with the understanding of crop condition. This system provides more
    water saving over single-threshold and multi-threshold based irrigation scheduling.
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed an automated irrigation system using a wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module to save water in irrigation. In this system, a
    network of soil moisture sensors with controller has been installed in a crop
    field for real-time monitoring and irrigation control. Gill et al. (2006) suggested
    a method for soil moisture prediction using support vector machines based on air
    temperature, relative air humidity and soil temperature. Jaguey et al. (2015)
    developed irrigation sensor based on smart phone. For sensing soil moisture, the
    digital camera of smart phone is used to process RGB to gray for estimation of
    ratio between wet and dry area of soil. The ratio of wetness and dryness is transmitted
    via gateway to water motor controller. A Mobile Application (APP) is developed
    to control sensor activity (like wakeup) and to set sensor in sleep mode. Goldstein
    et al. (2017) proposed irrigation recommendations based on machine learning algorithm
    with support of agronomist’s encysted knowledge. It was found that the best regression
    model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with 93% accuracy in prediction
    of irrigation plan/recommendation. The developed model is helpful to the agronomist’s
    irrigation management. Roopaei et al. (2017) proposed an intelligent irrigation
    monitoring system based on thermal imaging. The proposed technique uses thermal
    imaging camera mounted on Drone. An algorithm is developed using images processing
    techniques for identification of water requirement, Leaf water potential, and
    non-uniform irrigation, which are used for irrigation monitoring. Majority of
    the earlier irrigation systems do not consider the weather forecasting information
    (e.g., precipitation) while making irrigation decisions. It leads to a wastage
    of fresh water, energy and loss of crop growth (due to excess water) when a rain
    is followed immediately by the watering of the crop. To handle such cases, IoT
    based solutions can provide a better decision support for irrigation by utilizing
    weather forecasting information (e.g., precipitation) from the Internet. Further,
    the accuracy of weather forecasting is improving due to the advancement of satellite
    imagery technology. For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water in irrigation,
    it becomes essential to develop the smart irrigation systems based on dynamic
    prediction of soil moisture pattern of the field and precipitation information
    of upcoming days. This paper presents an intelligent system that predicts soil
    moisture based on the information collected from the sensors deployed at the field
    and the weather forecast information available on the Internet. The field data
    has been collected through a self-designed sensor node. The server-side software
    has been developed with node side connectivity along with information visualization
    and decision support features. A novel algorithm has been developed for soil-moisture
    prediction, which is based on Machine Learning techniques applied on the sensor
    node data and the weather forecast data. The algorithm shows improved accuracy
    and less error. The proposed approach could help in making effective irrigation
    decisions with optimum water usage. 2. Methods/Techniques used Prediction of soil
    moisture is vital for effective irrigation management system. The estimation of
    soil moisture depends upon evapotranspiration Hargreaves and Samani (1985) developed
    a method based on temperature and extra-terrestrial radiation to estimate ET0.
    It is expressed as (2) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax
    and Tmin = maximum temperature and minimum temperature (°C) and Ra = extra-terrestrial
    radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). Ritchie developed another method for estimation of ET0
    (Jones and Ritchie, 1990) based on temperature and solar radiation. It is expressed
    as (3) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum
    and minimum temperature (°C) and Rs = solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). When (4)
    Cobaner (2011) developed evapotranspiration estimation method based on Neuro-Fuzzy
    (NF) inference and found that the NF model (based on solar radiation, air temperature,
    and relative humidity) exhibits better accuracy than the combination of solar
    radiation, air temperature and wind speed. From state of art, it has been analyzed
    that prediction of soil moisture is possible using sensors placement at the field
    and weather forecasted data. So, we have considered evaporation of soil moisture
    based on air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and radiation.
    The parameters are considered for analyzing the soil moisture drain (change/difference)
    pattern based on the recorded data of soil moisture. An IoT based architecture
    (Fig. 1) has been proposed to collect, transmit and process the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and
    radiation) of farming land along with the weather forecast information to manage
    the irrigation efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    based on a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
    (block diagram shown in Fig. 3 and pseudocode is discussed in Section 3.2.1) has
    been developed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-means clustering for
    estimation of difference/change in soil moisture due to weather conditions. It
    gives good accuracy and less Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Theobald, 1974; “Mean Squared
    Error, 2018’’) in the prediction of the soil moisture of upcoming days with the
    help of sensors data and the weather forecasting data. SVR model has been trained
    using data (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, radiation,
    and soil moisture difference) collected from field device shown in Fig. 2. The
    Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) of upcoming days have been predicted using trained
    SVR model and the predicted value of SMD is given as input for k-means clustering
    for improving the accuracy of soil moisture difference (centroid value of k-means),
    which is more accurate (Table 2) with less MSE (Table 3). The final predicted
    soil moisture (Table 4) has been used in the development of smart irrigation scheduling
    algorithm (Section 3.2.2) to efficiently utilize the natural rain (precipitation)
    information for effective irrigation. To visualize the predicted soil moisture
    of upcoming days along with precipitation information and to control (start and
    stop) the irrigation, a responsive web portal has also been developed (Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download : Download full-size

    Planning Module. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) is the
    modified version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Hearst et al., 1998), where
    the dependent variable is numerical in lieu of categorical. SVR is a non-parametric
    technique and allows the creation of nonlinear models. The SVR method utilizes
    kernel functions to generate the model. Some of the frequently used kernel functions
    are Polynomial, Linear, Radial Basis and Sigmodal. k-means clustering (Kanungo
    et al., 2002) takes a straightforward and simple methodology to group a given
    information set into a definite number of clusters. The objective is to find k
    centroids, one for each bunch. First, it divides n number of the objects into
    k non-empty subgroups/cluster, and then finds the cluster centroids (mean point)
    of every subgroup/cluster. Then it calculates the distances from every point to
    the centroids and allocate each object to a specific cluster where the distance
    is minimum from the centroid. The process iterates to re-assign the points and
    identify the centroid of the new clusters. 3. The proposed system 3.1. System
    architecture The architecture of proposed IoT based smart irrigation system is
    shown in Fig. 1. It has seven main components, viz., Field data collection device
    with relay switch (Standalone and WSN Scenario); Web service for collecting field
    sensor data; Web service for collecting weather information available online (Internet);
    Web service to control water motor; Soil moisture prediction algorithm; Responsive
    web based interface for real-time monitoring; IoT enabled motor pump. These components
    are grouped into three different layers, i.e. Data collection and transmission
    layer, Data processing & intelligence layer and application layer of IoT (Fig.
    1). These components are discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1. Field data
    collection device Depending on the field requirements, a standalone sensor node
    or a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes may be deployed. In standalone
    scenario field data collection device consists of four sensors, viz., VH-400 Soil
    Moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor,
    and Ultraviolet (UV) Light Radiation sensor based on GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op
    Amp. The output of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno, which is connected
    to Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). In R-Pi a program is written in Python language to hourly
    fetch the data from sensors and to store the data in SQLite database, which is
    synched with the server database using developed web service. For large farming
    area, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) scenario with ZigBee
    (Pandey et al., 2017, Gutiérrez et al., 2014) technology can be implemented in
    which multiple sensor nodes can be planted in the specified area. Each sensor
    node will consist of the sensors similar to the standalone device. The output
    of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno connected to ZigBee for sending data
    to Gateway Node (similar to the standalone device with ZigBee connectivity) that
    will aggregate the received data and store it locally in SQLite and also send
    the data to the server using web service. The current analysis (statistical analysis
    of predicted soil moisture and its accuracy is exhibited in Fig. 6, Table 3, Table
    5) has been done with the standalone device. The standalone device is shown in
    Fig. 2. Table 5. Comparison of correlation, R squared and MSE between soil moisture
    values based on the sensor data and the proposed algorithm. Parameter Predicted

    Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the results shown in Table 2. 3.1.2. Web service
    for field sensor data collection The Web service is written in PHP with a light
    weighted REST API to communicate the data between the field device and the server.
    The service is hosted on Apache (Web server) at server machine. The R-Pi sends
    the field data to the server using this web service. This web service can handle
    the network fluctuation/outage during synchronizing the data from the filed device
    to the server with the help of flag settings at the database level. 3.1.3. Web
    service for online weather data collection A web service has been developed in
    Python to collect the weather forecasting data. This web service also aggregates
    the weather forecasting data like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, UV Index
    and precipitation of different web forecasting portal like OpenWeather and AccuWeather
    using API of these portal (Weather API, 2012, API Reference, 2017). These portals
    provide the forecasted information in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The developed
    web service read the forecasted data (JSON format) of the specified location using
    API and store it in MySQL database at the server, which is considered in the prediction
    algorithm. 3.1.4. Soil moisture prediction algorithm An algorithm has been developed
    (Fig. 3) to predict the soil moisture based on field sensors data and weather
    forecasting data using support vector regression model and k-means clustering
    algorithm. The algorithm shows information regarding soil moisture of the upcoming
    days. It also provides irrigation suggestions, based on the defined level of soil
    moisture and predicted precipitation, to save water and energy. The generated
    information by algorithm and device is stored in MySQL Database at the server.
    The algorithm is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. 3.1.5. Responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring A responsive web based user interface is developed
    using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap API for real-time monitoring and scheduling of
    irrigation activities (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The interface visualizes real-time sensors
    data, predicted soil moisture of upcoming days, and precipitation information.
    Further, it also provides a facility for irrigation scheduling. The user can schedule
    the irrigation at a specified threshold value of soil moisture. The system guides
    to maintain the threshold value based on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The system can automatically start the irrigation,
    which stops after achieving the specified threshold value of soil moisture. 3.1.6.
    Web service to control water motor A web service has been developed on top of
    HTTP protocol to start and stop the water motor. This web service has been accessed
    by Python code in R-Pi to start and stop the water motor. The Python code (running
    on R-Pi) send signal to Arduino-Uno that controls the relay switch to start/stop
    the water motor. 3.1.7. IoT enabled water pump In this module, a water pump is
    connected to a relay switch that is controlled by a Wi-Fi enabled node. The node
    is controlled by the web service through a trigger from the responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring. Using this web based interface the water pump
    can be managed remotely in manual and auto modes. 3.1.8. Communication technologies
    used in proposed architecture In the proposed architecture, the WiFi module/Mobile
    data communication module can be used as communication media between the field
    device and the server. In this experiment (Standalone device scenario), a WiFi
    module has been used to send the data to the server. In WSN scenario, ZigBee network
    can be used between sensor node to Gateway Node and then a WiFi module or Mobile
    data communication module can be used to send the data from the gateway node to
    the server. 3.2. Prediction algorithm and data visualization Flow diagram of the
    proposed soil moisture prediction algorithm and the irrigation planning algorithm
    for data visualization and decision support is shown in Fig. 3. 3.2.1. Algorithm
    for soil moisture prediction Algorithm Steps (Variables as in Table 1.) • Initialize

    scheduling Algorithm Steps Step 1. Initialize minimum threshold (THmin) of soil
    moisture to start irrigation and maximum threshold (THmax) of soil moisture to
    stop irrigation Step2. Set mode (manual/auto) for irrigation Step 3. If (mode = auto)  {   Read
    and check current soil moisture (Csm)   If (Csm <= THmin) // condition check of
    current soil moisture from its set threshold value by user   {    Ndate = Read

    required soil moisture (Rsm) = sum (predicted SMD from current date to nearest
    date of precipitation (Ndate)) //Total change in soil moisture till nearest precipitation

    moisture required to maintain crop growth    while (THmax > Csm) // condition

    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to Start Water motor    }    Send 0 to
    relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor  } Else   {    Send
    0 to relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor   }  } Else  {   Enter/Set
    date to start irrigation    If (current_date >= irrigation_date) // condition

    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to start the water motor     }    }    Else    {     Send
    0 to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor    }  } 3.2.3. Experimental
    setup The main objective of this experiment is to collect the physical parameters
    of a farming land using sensors and to utilize these sensors’ data along with
    weather forecast information for developing an algorithm for prediction of soil
    moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm uses a hybrid machine learning approach,
    as discussed in Section 3.2, to achieve higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    It provides a probable estimate of soil moisture to plan and provision the optimum
    irrigation. Statistical measures, R squared (Table 5) and Mean Squared Error (Table
    3, Table 5), are used for estimation of accuracy and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. The experiment shows that a good estimation (close to the actual value)
    of the soil moisture (Table 4), with the help of field data and forecasted information,
    can be utilized for optimum irrigation with an effective utilization of natural
    rain. As described in Section 3.1, one field data collection device (node) has
    been deployed in the garden of our organization to collect the field data (Fig.
    2). The data is collected at the server using the web services. Then, the data
    is analyzed using the proposed machine learning approach (Section 3.2.1). Further,
    a responsive web based interface has been developed for real-time monitoring,
    data visualization and decision support system, and for the scheduling of irrigation.
    Fig. 4 shows the GUI of responsive web based interface for real-time monitoring
    and decision support system, which shows the current soil moisture recorded by
    the sensor, and the predicted soil moisture generated by the algorithm. This information,
    predicted soil moisture and precipitation information, will help user/farmer in
    planning/scheduling of optimum irrigation. Fig. 5 shows the GUI of irrigation
    planning module to schedule the irrigation by setting Irrigation Date, and Threshold
    Levels for Soil Moisture. It works in two modes, viz., auto, and manual, as discussed
    in Section 3.2.2. In manual mode, the user takes the scheduling decision based
    on predicted soil moisture and precipitation information. In auto mode, user sets
    the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the system automatically schedules the
    irrigation date based on the predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation)
    information. For example, if rain is expected on the scheduled irrigation date
    or near to scheduled date, then the system will wait for the rain and it will
    suspend the artificial/manual irrigation or it will start watering (if needed,
    based on the algorithm) the field to maintain minimum soil moisture till the arrival
    of rain. Further, the system can handle the changes in forecasted precipitation
    values. 4. Results and discussion The smartness of the proposed system is dependent
    on the accuracy of the predicted soil moisture (Table 4, Table 5). To verify the
    accuracy of soil moisture prediction algorithm, the hourly field data for air
    temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV is collected
    for three weeks. The three weeks’ hourly data has been averaged out on per day
    basis and the 21 days’ data is divided into a training set (70% of the data) and
    testing set (30% of the data) for applying the proposed algorithm. Initially,
    we have predicted SMD of upcoming days using the proposed algorithm (Fig. 3) and
    the predicted values of SMD has been used in prediction of soil moisture of upcoming
    days. The results are summarized in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The SVR + k-means
    approach has higher accuracy with lower mean squared error over SVR approach while
    calculating SMD (Table 2 and Table 3). The graph (Fig. 6) shows that predicted
    SMD using proposed algorithm (SVR + k-means) is nearer to actual SMD as compared
    to predicted SMD using SVR only. The SVR + k-means approach has the same accuracy
    with the lower mean squared error over SVR approach in soil moisture prediction
    (Tables 4 and 5). The predicted soil moisture shown in Table 4 has been calculated
    based on soil moisture and SMD of previous day, e.g. soil moisture on 14-11-2017
    is 26.8982 then the soil moisture of the next day (15-11-2017) will be equal to
    the difference of soil moisture on the previous day (i.e., 14–11-2017) and SMD
    difference predicted for 15-11-2017 (Table 2). From the Tables 2 and 3, we have
    observed that the prediction of SMD using SVR + k-means approach gives higher
    accuracy with less MSE as compared to SVR approach, and we have also observed
    the same accuracy (R squared = 96%) with lesser MSE in prediction of soil moisture
    using combined approach (SVR + k-means) (Table 5). It shows that the proposed
    algorithm (based on SVR + k-means) is better as compared to SVR based approach.
    Due to higher accuracy and minimum MSE, SVR + k-means based hybrid machine learning
    algorithm has been used in irrigation planning module. 5. Conclusion The soil
    moisture is a critical parameter for developing a smart irrigation system. The
    soil moisture is affected by a number of environmental variables, e.g., air temperature,
    air humidity, UV, soil temperature, etc. With advancement in technologies, the
    weather forecasting accuracy has improved significantly and the weather forecasted
    data can be used for prediction of changes in the soil moisture. This paper proposes
    an IoT based smart irrigation architecture along with a hybrid machine learning
    based approach to predict the soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensors’
    data of recent past and the weather forecasted data for prediction of soil moisture
    of upcoming days. The predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms
    of their accuracy and error rate. Further, the prediction approach is integrated
    into a standalone system prototype. The system prototype is cost effective, as
    it is based on the open standard technologies. The auto mode makes it a smart
    system and it can be further customized for application specific scenarios. In
    future, we are planning to conduct a water saving analysis based on proposed algorithm
    with multiple nodes along with minimizing the system cost. Acknowledgements Authors

    & Engineering Chemistry Research Abstract In agriculture irrigation management,
    irrigation scheduling is typically performed in an open-loop fashion and is done
    only once at the beginning of a growing season. In this work, we study whether
    closed-loop scheduling with closed-loop control can lead to improved performance
    in terms of crop yield and water conservation in agriculture irrigation. The interaction
    between soil, water, crop (maize in this work), and atmosphere is described by
    an agro-hydrological model, which is a partial differential equation. In the proposed
    scheduling and control scheme, both the scheduler and the controller are designed
    using model predictive control (MPC). The scheduler uses a long horizon (with
    a sampling period of 1 day) that covers the entire crop growth season, and the
    horizon shrinks as time moves. The primary objective of the scheduler is to maximize
    the crop yield. The controller uses a much shorter prediction horizon and a much
    finer sampling period. The primary objective of the controller is to track the
    soil moisture reference calculated by the scheduler. To alleviate the computational
    complexity of the scheduler and the controller, a linear parameter varying (LPV)
    model is identified for the scheduler and controller, respectively. The performance
    of the closed-loop scheduling scheme is evaluated against the traditional open-loop
    scheduling scheme under different scenarios. This publication is licensed under

    ISSUE This article is part of the Sirish Shah Festschrift special issue. 1. Introduction
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue globally.
    It is critical to increase the efficiency of water usage especially in agriculture
    since it consumes the largest portion of fresh water (70% approximately). (1,2)
    Traditionally, agriculture irrigation decisions are primarily made in open-loop
    on the basis of empirical or heuristic knowledge, and no real-time feedback information
    (e.g., soil moisture) from the field is used. These open-loop irrigation methods
    are not precise and typically lead to significant over irrigation. In the past
    decade, there has been an increasing interest in lower-level closed-loop agriculture
    irrigation for precision irrigation. Different control algorithms based on real-time
    field feedback like soil moisture measurement have been reported in the literature.
    For example, Goodchild et al. proposed a modified proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) control to improve the irrigation precision. (3) Kim et al. developed a
    closed-loop irrigation control system for a self-propelled lateral-move sprinkler
    irrigation system. (4) Model predictive control (MPC) has also been investigated
    in the optimal control of agriculture irrigation. Park et al. used MPC to maintain
    the field at desired soil moisture and salt levels. (5) McCarthy et al. used crop
    production models in MPC to optimize irrigation time and amount. (6) Delgoda et
    al. implemented MPC to minimize root zone soil moisture deficit and irrigation
    amount with a limit on water supply. (7) Recently, Mao et al. developed a zone
    MPC algorithm to maintain soil moisture within a target zone instead of a set-point.
    This approach was shown to lead to further water conservation. (8) The above-mentioned
    irrigation control studies all focus on short time (hourly or daily) irrigation
    management. A typical objective of these studies is to maintain the soil moisture
    or root zone soil moisture deficit at a predetermined set-point or zone. Irrigation
    scheduling is another important subject in agriculture irrigation management,
    which considers water management over a much longer time period (e.g., the entire
    growing season of a crop). In general, a water balance accounting for plant water
    consumption, evaporation and drainage loss, historical weather data, and available
    soil moisture is used in irrigation scheduling. (9−11) Different objectives were
    considered in irrigation scheduling including, for example, profit maximization,
    (12) crop yield maximization, (13) and irrigation uniformity optimization. (14)
    One common feature of the above scheduling studies is that the scheduling optimization
    problem is only solved once at the beginning of the crop growing season, and the
    solution is used for the entire season. In this work, we introduce feedback into
    irrigation scheduling and integrate it with irrigation control to form a hierarchical
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme. It is well recognized in chemical process
    industries that the closed-loop scheduling and control can bring improved economic
    performance. (15−19) The primary objective of this work is to study the closed-loop
    scheduling and control in agriculture irrigation management and investigate whether
    closed-loop scheduling brings any benefits to irrigation management. In the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme, a scheduler operates in the top layer
    with the objective to maximize the crop yield. The scheduler calculates the target
    soil moisture value and passes it to a lower layer irrigation controller. The
    lower layer controller’s primary objective is to follow the target soil moisture.
    Both the scheduler and the controller are designed in the framework of MPC. The
    scheduler uses a prediction horizon that covers the entire growing season of the
    crop (maize in this work). The scheduler is re-evaluated every week on the basis
    of updated weather forecast and soil moisture measurement from the field with
    a shrinking horizon. The controller uses a prediction horizon of 1 week and calculates
    irrigation commands to follow the target soil moisture determined by the scheduler.
    The soil water dynamics of the field are described by an agro-hydrological model
    that consists of a partial differential equation. To alleviate the computational
    complexity of the scheduler and the controller, a linear parameter varying (LPV)
    model is identified for the scheduler and the controller, respectively, based
    on input and output data from the agro-hydrological model. The main contributions
    of this work include: A method to identify an LPV model for the scheduler to describe
    the interaction between soil water and the crop over the entire growing season
    that contains different growing stages. The LPV model is computationally efficient
    for online optimization. A detailed closed-loop scheduler and controller design
    to maximize crop yield and water conservation. Extensive simulations that investigate
    the performance of the closed-loop scheduler with respect to the traditional open-loop
    scheduling. 2. System Description ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The system considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment. The interaction between
    the soil, the water, the atmosphere, and the crop is described by an agro-hydrological
    model. The yield of the crop is characterized using the ratio of the actual evapo-transpiration
    to the potential evapo-transpiration. The crop considered is maize. A schematic
    of the considered system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1. System considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment over the entire growing
    season of the crop maize. 2.1. Agro-hydrological Model We consider an agro-hydrological
    system that characterizes the interaction between the soil, the water, the atmosphere,
    and the crop. The system is modeled by a set of empirical and physical relations.
    The dynamics of the water flow inside soil is described using the Richards equation:
    (20) (1) where θ is the soil moisture content (cm/cm), K is the hydraulic conductivity
    (cm/h), z is the vertical distance inside soil matrix (cm) taken positive upward,
    S includes the source and sink terms (h–1), such as soil water extraction rate
    by plant roots, and h is the matric potential (cm) also known as soil suction.
    The hydraulic conductivity K can be expressed in terms of soil moisture content
    as follows: (21) (2) where Ksat is saturated hydraulic conductivity, λ = 0.5 is
    the shape parameter, (22) and Se is the relative saturation given by (3) where
    θres is the residual moisture content (cm/cm), θsat is the saturated moisture
    content (cm/cm). The relation between soil moisture content θ and matric potential
    h is described by the Van Genuchten model: (23) (4) where η and m are empirical
    shape factors, and αv is the inverse of air entry suction (cm–1). In general,
    m is considered as a dependent variable of η such as . Thus, the Richards equation
    can be described as follows: (5) where C is the hydraulic capacity, which accounts
    for the change of soil moisture due to the change of soil matric potential; that
    is, C = dθ/dh. In the Richards equation, eq 5, S(h) represents the soil water
    extraction rate by the crop roots, which accounts for the transpiration rate T.
    The top water flux qtop at the soil-atmosphere interface is considered in the
    top boundary calculation of the Richards equation. The top water flux qtop can
    be expressed as follows: (6) where qtop is the top flux, I is the irrigation rate,
    P is the precipitation rate, and E denotes evaporation. The transpiration T and
    evaporation E are calculated following the method in SWAP model. (24) The top
    boundary of this agro-hydrological system is time varying depending on the surface
    soil moisture condition, and may switch between the flux and the pressure head
    boundary conditions. Both of these boundary conditions are determined using the
    qtop value as described in the work of Van Dam and Feddes. (25) In this study
    the bottom boundary condition is taken as free drainage. Following the method
    used in the work of Van Dam et al. (24) and Nahar et al., (26)eq 5 can be discretized
    using the implicit finite difference method with explicit linearization of the
    hydraulic conductivity K(h). Let us consider that the spatial domain is discretized
    into ND compartments with the top one as compartment 1 and the bottom one as compartment
    ND. After discretization, at compartment i (i = 2, ..., ND – 1), the water content
    dynamics are described as follows: (7) where hi is the matric potential of the
    i-th compartment, n denotes the discretized time with a sampling period of a hour,
    , , , , ui(k) = Si(k)Δzi, and Δzi denotes the thickness of compartment i. In eq
    7, Ki+1/2 denotes the average hydraulic conductivity between compartment i and
    i + 1. The boundary conditions of the system define i = 1 and i = ND. Defining
    h = [h1h2 ... hND]T, combining the equations for the ND compartments together,
    and splitting the inputs to the system into manipulated inputs and uncontrolled
    inputs, the overall dynamics can be written in the following compact form: (8)
    where u is the manipulated input (irrigation) and w denotes disturbances and uncontrolled
    inputs such as rain and weather conditions. Note that h is a column vector whose
    size depends on the number of discretization points ND in the spatial domain.
    On the basis of eq 4, the soil moisture is a function of the matric potential
    h. For the soil moisture at each compartment i, we can use eq 4 to find the corresponding
    matric potential hi. For brevity, we write these equations in the following compact
    form: (9) where the function g represents the relation between θ and h as expressed
    in eq 4. Note that when i = 1, it indicates the top surface. Eqs 8 and 9 define
    the system equations for the dynamics of water flow inside soil. For more details
    of the derivation of eqs 8 and 9, the reader may refer to Nahar et al. (26) 2.2.
    Crop Yield Model The crop yield is modeled as a function of the potential evapo-transpiration
    and the actual evapo-transpiration as follows: (12) (10) where Ya is the actual
    yield, Yp is the potential maximum yield, ETa is the actual evapo-transpiration
    and ETp is the potential evapo-transpiration, and is the crop sensitivity factor
    (also known as yield response factor) for the growing period at time k. Crop sensitivity
    factor is a measure used to indicate the impact of water stress (at different
    growing stages) on the overall yield of the crop. When the actual yield is equal
    to the potential yield, eq 10 takes its minimum value zero. In eq 10, represents
    the yield reduction or the yield deficiency and represents the relative reduction
    in evapo-transpiration or ET deficiency. The potential and the actual evapo-transpiration
    values of a crop are defined as follows: (27) (11) (12) where is an empirical
    crop factor that describes the relation of ETp to the potential evapo-transpiration
    of the reference crop (grass) ET0, and is the water stress factor, which is a
    function of the soil moisture and relates ETa to ETp. In eq 11, the reference
    evapo-transpiration ET0 is calculated using Penman–Montieth equation based on
    hourly weather data. (27) In eq 12, the water stress factor is modeled following
    the method in Feddes’s work (28) and will be made clear in Section 3.3.1. It is
    noted that eq 12 holds when other factors such as nutrient deficiency or diseases
    are not present. Combining eqs 10 and 12, the following relation can be obtained
    to describe the relation between the crop yield and soil moisture: (13) In this
    work, following the work of Van Dam et al., (24) a simple maize model is used
    to calculate the evapo-transpiration amounts at different growing stages. Note
    that the crop water requirement increases as the crop grows. This implies that
    more water is required to keep the soil moisture at the same level as crop grows.
    3. Problem Formulation and Proposed Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 3.1. Closed-Loop
    Scheduling and Control Problem Formulation In this section, we describe the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control framework for precision irrigation. The scheduler
    and the controller form a hierarchical decision making system. In this work, both
    the scheduler and the controller will be designed in the framework of MPC. The
    primary objective of the scheduler is to maximize the crop yield at the end of
    the entire growing season. It considers a much longer horizon that covers the
    entire growing season and uses historical weather data, available weekly weather
    forecast, and soil moisture measurement from the field to calculate the soil moisture
    reference trajectories for the lower layer controller. The primary objective of
    the controller is to track the soil moisture reference calculated by the scheduler.
    It uses a fixed prediction horizon of a week and takes into account the soil moisture
    measurement and daily weather forecast in its irrigation command calculation.
    A schematic of the closed-loop scheduling and control framework is shown in Figure
    2. Figure 2 Figure 2. Structure of the closed-loop scheduling and control system.
    Left: Process block diagram; Right: The design of prediction horizon. 3.2. Scheduling
    and Control Model Identification The direct use of the agro-hydrological model,
    eqs 8 and 9, in the scheduler and the controller is computationally challenging
    due to the stiffness of the nonlinear system when the soil moisture is low, the
    high dimensions of the discretized system, and the large horizon covered by the
    scheduler. In order to overcome the computational challenge and to capture the
    dynamics between the input and the output of the agro-hydrological system, we
    propose to identify an LPV model for the scheduler and the controller, respectively.
    The two LPV models can be identified based on the simulated input–output data
    from the agro-hydrological model. LPV models have been widely used to describe
    nonlinear processes due to its simple structure and its ability to approximate
    complex nonlinear systems. (29−32) 3.2.1. Scheduling Model The output of the scheduling
    model is the average root zone soil moisture content described as follows: (14)
    where θs is the average root zone soil moisture, θi is determined by eq 9, and
    Nr < ND is the deepest node that contains the crop roots. Note that Nr changes
    over time as the length of roots grows. The LPV model consists of a set of linear
    models that are connected with varying parameters which are functions of scheduling
    variables. (33) The scheduling variables are the ones that can be used to reflect
    the nonlinearity of the dynamics of the system. For the scheduling model, two
    scheduling variables are used. They are the soil moisture s1 (s1 = θ) and the
    root depth s2. The sampling period used in the scheduling model is 1 day. For
    each scheduling variable, a few working points need to be determined and around
    those working points, linear models are identified. Let us assume that we have
    H working points for s1 and G working points for s2. These working points define
    a mesh with HG nodes. For each of these nodes, a linear model should be identified.
    Let us also use (i, j) (i = 1, 2, ..., H, j = 1, 2, ..., G) to denote the node
    defined by the i-th s1 working point and the j-th s2 working point. For each node
    (i, j), a linear model of the following form is identified: (15) where m denotes
    the discrete time with a sampling period of a day, xi,j is the output of the linear
    model for (i, j), api,j (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi,j (q = 1, 2, ..., nb), and di,j
    are model parameters, u is the manipulated input. The model orders na and nb are
    determined prior to the identification process. This model can also be expressed
    as follows: (16) where φi,j(m) = [−xi,j(m – 1), ..., −xi,j(m – na), u(m – 1), ...,
    u(m – nb), 1]T, and βi,j = [a1i,j, ..., anai,j, b1i,j, ..., bnbi,j, di,j]T. With
    respect to s1 (soil moisture), the linear models are combined together using Gaussian
    weighting functions as follows: (17) where y∗j is an intermediate variable, and
    the weighting function αi is given by (18) where with s1,i the soil moisture value
    of the i-th prespecified s1 working point, σi1 and σi2 being two parameters that
    need to be identified, which is related to the validity width of the linear model.
    (8) With respect to s2 (root length), the outputs obtained from eq 17 are further
    linearly interpolated to get the final output of the LPV model: (19) given that
    the root length at time m lies between s2,j and s2,j+1 (i.e., s2,j ≤ s2(m) ≤ s2,j+1).
    Note that the length of the roots grows according to the time after seeding and
    is considered as a function of time in this work. In eq 19, y is the average water
    content within the root zone given by the LPV model. Eq 19 is the model that will
    be used in the scheduler and may be written equivalently in the following state-space
    form: (20) (21) where A, B are composed of elements in βi,j (i = 1, 2, ..., H,
    j = 1, 2, ..., G), C depends on the two scheduling variables, d is composed of
    di,j, and us is composed of the current and previous daily irrigation amounts.
    The detailed identification of the above LPV model will be discussed in Section
    4. 3.2.2. Control Model Since the controller uses a relatively much smaller prediction
    horizon (a week), we consider an LPV model with only the soil moisture (s1) as
    the scheduling variable. In this model, we consider the root length of the crop
    is constant within each control prediction horizon. The output of the control
    model is also the average soil water content within the root zone as defined in
    eq 14. The sampling period of the LPV model for control purposes is also a day.
    The LPV takes the following form: (22a) (22b) where x̃i is the output of a submodel
    and ỹ is the final output of the LPV model, api (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi (q =
    1, 2, ..., nb), and di are model parameters, αi is a weighting factor determined
    following eq 18. At different crop growing stages, the above control model should
    be reidentified to account for the growth of the crop. The above model can also
    be written equivalently in the following state-space form: (23) (24) where Ã,
    B̃ are composed of api and bqi (i = 1, 2, ..., H), C̃ depends on the scheduling
    variable, d̃ is composed of di, and uc is composed of the current and previous
    daily irrigation amounts. The details will be discussed also in Section 4. 3.3.
    Design of Scheduler and Controller 3.3.1. Design of the Scheduler As explained
    earlier, the main objective of the scheduler is to minimize the crop yield deficiency
    while reducing the irrigation water usage. From eq 13, it can be seen that crop
    yield relates to the water stress factor . The stress factor characterizes the
    suppression of root water update due to either drought or insufficient aeration.
    Figure 3 shows a typical relation of and soil moisture. (28) When the soil moisture
    θ is between θL (limiting point) and θa (anaerobic point), there is no water stress
    (). When the soil moisture θ is below θL but larger than θw (wilting point), water
    stress takes place due to drought. When the soil moisture θ is above θa but less
    than θu, there is crop water stress due to insufficient aeration; when θ is above
    θu, crop transpiration stops. For all other soil moisture region, root water extraction
    is completely suppressed. Therefore, it is also important to ensure that the soil
    moisture is always between θw and θu. Specifically, the value of the water stress
    factor is determined as follows: (28) (25) Figure 3 Figure 3. Relation of soil
    moisture content and water stress factor. (28) The scheduler optimization problem
    is evaluated every week. It uses a prediction horizon from the current week to
    the end of the growing season T. Within each week, the irrigation is considered
    to be constant. For week k, the optimization problem is shown below: (26a) (26b)
    (26c) (26d) (26e) (26f) (26g) (26h) In the optimization problem (eq 26), eq 26a
    defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 26a, the first term indicates
    the crop yield deficiency at the end of the growing season, the second term measures
    the irrigation amount in the remaining growing season, the last summation term
    includes two slack variables that are used to handle constraints on the soil moisture
    in eq 26g, and Qs1, Qs2, Qs3 are positive weighting factors. Eq 26b is the model
    used to calculate the crop yield deficiency. Note that in eq 26b the first part
    on the right-hand side is calculated on the basis of actual soil water content
    measurements, and the second part is calculated on the basis of soil water content
    predicted in the scheduler. Eqs 26c and 26d are the LPV model for scheduling evaluated
    for a week with constant input. Note that the sampling period of the model identified
    in the previous subsection is a day. The scheduler optimization problem, however,
    evaluates once every week. Within a week, the input is held constant. Eq 26c reflects
    this type of consideration. Eq 26e defines the initial condition of the scheduling
    optimization problem, and x̅(k) denotes the current state measurement. Note that
    we assume that the state is measured. Eq 26f requires that all the irrigation
    should be non-negative and is less than the maximum allowed limit umax. Eq 26g
    imposes the constraint such that θw < y < θu as soft constraints through the introduction
    of two slack variables ε1 and ε2. Eq 26h implies that the two slack variables
    are non-negative. The weighting factors Qs3 and Qs4 should be tuned to be relatively
    higher to avoid constraint violation. The solution to the above scheduling optimization
    problem is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount from week k to T. Let us denote
    the optimal weekly irrigation as u*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1. Let us also denote
    the corresponding weekly optimal soil moisture as y*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1.
    The first two values of the optimal irrigation values u*(k|k), u*(k + 1|k), and
    the corresponding soil moisture values y*(k|k), y*(k + 1|k) are sent to the controller
    as references. At the next week, the scheduling optimization problem is re-evaluated
    with new soil moisture measurement. 3.3.2. Design of the Controller In the controller
    design, the control LPV model is first augmented with an output disturbance to
    account for model-plant mismatch. Then, an observer is designed to estimate the
    model-plant mismatch. The augmented model is as follows: (27) (28) (29) On the
    basis of the above augmented model, the following observer is designed to estimate
    the output disturbance: (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) where x̂, p̂, ŷ, and y̅ denote
    the estimated state, estimated disturbance, estimated output, and output measurement,
    respectively. The observer gains Lx and Lp are determined as discussed in Mao
    et al. (8) The primary objective of the controller is to track the soil moisture
    and total irrigation water consumption references calculated by the scheduler.
    The controller is also designed in the framework of MPC. The controller is evaluated
    every day with updated soil moisture measurements. The controller uses a fixed
    prediction horizon of a week (i.e., 7). At day m, the controller is formulated
    as follows: (35a) (35b) (35c) (35d) (35e) (35f) (35g) (35h) In the optimization
    problem (eq 35), eq 35a defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 35a,
    y* and u* denote the references from the scheduler. The first term requires that
    the predicted average soil moisture content within the root zone should be close
    to the reference from the scheduler, the second term requires that the total water
    consumption over a week is close to the predicted consumption of the scheduler,
    and the last terms contain two slack variables. In eq 35a, Qc, Qc1, Qc2, and R
    are positive weighting factors. Eq 35b is the LPV model for control. Eq 35c implies
    that a constant output disturbance is considered in the optimization of the controller
    and the disturbance value is given by the observer as specified in eq 35e. This
    constant output disturbance is added to the output equation as specified in eq
    35d. Eq 35e defines the initial condition of the control optimization problem,
    and x̂ is from the observer. Eq 35f requires that all the irrigation should be
    non-negative and is smaller than or equal to one-seventh of the weekly upper limit.
    Eq 35g imposes the constraint such that θw < ỹ < θu as soft constraints. Eq 35h
    implies that the two slack variables are non-negative. The solution to the optimization
    problem (eq 35) is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount for time l = m, ...,
    m + 6 denoted by u*(l|m), l = m, ..., m + 6. At time m, only the first element
    from the optimal daily irrigation input is applied to the field. The rest are
    discarded. At the next day m + 1, the optimization problem is solved again 4.
    Results and Discussion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 4.1. LPV Model Identification and
    Validation In the identification of the scheduling LPV model, three working points
    are considered for each of the two scheduling variables (H = 3, G = 3). In the
    input-output data generation, the three s2 working points are s2 = [s2,1, s2,2,
    s2,3]T = [10.3571, 55.3571, 99.881]T cm. These working points are picked according
    to the root length of maize at different growing stages (see Figure 4). Specifically,
    the first working point of s2 corresponds to the root length about 10 days after
    seeding and is picked to represent the baby plant. The second working point is
    the mean value of the root length of the rapid growing stage and the last working
    point is the root length at the fully matured stage. For each working point of
    s2, three different s1 working points are considered. For s2,1, the three s1 working
    points are s1{1} = [s1,1{1}, s1,2{1}, s1,3{1}]T = [0.0755, 0.0936, 0.1792]T. For
    s2,2, the three s1 working points are s1{2} = [s1,1{2}, s1,2{2}, s1,3{2}]T = [0.0789,
    0.1211, 0.1988]T. For s2,3, the three s1 working points are s1{3} = [s1,1{3},
    s1,2{3}, s1,3{3}]T = [0.0835, 0.1176, 0.1564]T. For each s2 working point, the
    three s1 working points are determined according to three (small, medium, large)
    steady-state irrigation amounts, which are picked based on extensive simulations
    and trail-and-error. In determining these irrigation amounts, one consideration
    is the possible soil moisture range of the system (about 0.05–0.35), and another
    consideration is the nonlinearity feature of the agro-hydrological system. The
    orders of the local models na and nb are both picked to be one based on the results
    of Mao et al. (8) Figure 4 Figure 4. Root length of maize according to time after
    seeding. The input and output data for the LPV identification generated from the
    agro-hydrological model is shown in Figure 5. In generating the data, the daily
    weather condition is kept constant with no rain. Binary input signals are used
    around the working points. During the transition from one working point to another
    of s1 (soil moisture), constant inputs are used. In the top plot of Figure 5,
    CS1, CS2, CS3 correspond to the three working points of s2 (root depth). During
    these regions, binary inputs are used. Region CV1 and CV2 correspond to transition
    periods from s2,1 to s2,2 and from s2,2 to s2,3. In these two regions, constant
    inputs are used to show the effect of crop root zone on soil moisture. As crop
    root length increases (from CS1 to CS3), more irrigation is required to maintain
    the soil moisture as shown in the top plot of Figure 5. Following the approach
    in Mao et al., (8) the parameters of the LPV model are identified and shown in
    Table 1. The bottom plot of Figure 5 shows the predicted trajectory and the actual
    trajectory generated by the agro-hydrological model. The LPV model overall has
    a good fit over the entire period with the percentage difference between the predicted
    value of the LPV model and the actual value of the agro-hydrological model about
    5% or less except in the region CV1, which corresponds to the rapid growing stage
    (whose percentage difference is about 18%). To further validate the developed
    LPV model over the crop growing season, an open-loop simulation of the agro-hydrological
    model is performed. Fixed weather condition is considered with no rain, and an
    input irrigation of 2.5 cm/day is considered. The result is shown in Figure 6.
    The overall percentage difference between the predicted value given by the LPV
    model and the value generated by the agro-hydrological model is about 27% with
    most of it contributed from the period between day 23 and day 45 which corresponds
    to the rapid growing stage. In the rest of the period, the percentage difference
    is around 15%. Given the complexity of the agro-hydrological system and the use
    of feedback, the mismatch between the LPV model and the agro-hydrological model
    is considered to be acceptable. Note that the performance of the LPV model may
    be improved by including more working points. Figure 5 Figure 5. Input–output

    6. Validation of the scheduling LPV model. In the controller, the three local
    linear models of each root length working point are weighted using the corresponding
    Gaussian weights in Table 1 and then are used in the controller design. For example,
    in CS1 and up to the middle of CV1, the local models of root length working point
    1 are weighted and used in the MPC controller. The switching between root length
    working points is based on the root length. 4.2. Scheduling and Control Simulation
    Results The proposed closed-loop scheduling and control is applied to the agro-hydrological
    system under different scenarios. The proposed closed-loop scheduling approach
    is compared with an open-loop scheduling scheme in which the scheduling optimization
    is only solved once at the beginning and applied throughout the growing season.
    In the open-loop scheduling scheme, the same closed-loop controller is used. The
    crop growing season is considered to be 23 weeks from seeding. The values of the
    crop sensitivity factor at different crop growth stages (from 0 to 2 with 0 indicating
    initial seeding stage and 2 implying mature stage) for maize are shown in Table
    2. (34) The weekly irrigation upper limit is umax = 70 cm/week, which implies
    that the daily irrigation limit is 10 cm. Table 2. Values of Crop Sensitivity

    Weather In the first scenario, we consider that the amount of rain in the current
    crop season is similar to that of the historical weather data. In this scenario,
    we consider that the actual total rain in the crop growing season is 164.05 cm
    but the historical weather data suggests the total rain over the season to be
    154.50 cm. In the closed-loop scheduling, the scheduler is updated at the end
    of each week with an update weather forecast for the next 2 weeks and the current
    soil moisture measurement. While in the open-loop scheduling, only the historical
    weather data is used at the beginning of the season. As for the controller, in
    both schemes, the field soil moisture is updated every day with field measurements
    and the weather data is also updated for the next 7 days. Uncertainties are considered
    in weather forecast. First, we consider a water conservation case. That is, in
    the scheduler design, more emphasis is put on water conservation. In this case,
    the weighting factors are chosen as Qs1 = 10002, Qs2 = 100, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4
    = 1. The value of Qs3 is chosen very high to ensure that the constraint on the
    lower soil moisture limit is not violated. The weight on the upper soil moisture
    limit is relatively low since it is less important and can be controlled to some
    extent by the irrigation amount. Compared with the next case to be studied, Qs2
    = 100 puts more weighting on water consumption. The values for θu and θw are taken
    as 0.41 cm/cm and 0.15 cm/cm. The wilting value θw for the system is considered
    to be 0.09 cm/cm. Since there is model-plant mismatch, a lower limit that is higher
    than the wilting point is used. For the MPC controller, the weighting factors
    are Qc = 100, Rc = 0.001, Qc1 = 1000, and Qc2 = 0.01. In the controller, a different
    lower limit 0.13 cm/cm on the soil moisture is used since the controller gets
    daily feedback of soil moisture from the farm and it can handle uncertainty better.
    The simulation results are shown in Figure 7 for the closed-loop scheduling scheme
    and in Figure 8 for the open-loop scheduling scheme. For simplicity, only 1 day
    weather forecast is shown in the figures. In both schemes, the MPC controller
    overall is able to track the soil moisture targets well. The over prediction by
    the LPV model subplot (c) of Figures 7 and 8 is relatively significant in the
    crop rapid growing stage, which is due the relatively big mismatch of the LPV
    model from the actual system in the rapid growing stage. The peak at around day
    15 is due to the sudden increase in the actual rain that is not captured in the
    weather forecast. Table 3 summarizes the results of this case. From the table,
    it can be seen that the open-loop scheme has a slightly (1.5%) better crop yield
    deficiency while the closed-loop scheme has a slightly reduced (1.9%) irrigation
    amount. Figure 7 Figure 7. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling scheme

    1242.00 Second, we consider a case that we put less emphasis on water conservation
    (i.e., more on crop yield reduction). In the scheduler, the weights are Qs1 =
    10004, Qs2 = 1, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4 = 1. The lower soil moisture constraint in
    the scheduler is decreased to θw = 0.13 cm/cm whereas for the controller the lower
    limit is increased and set to be the set-point from the scheduler. The weights
    in the controller cost function are kept same as in the previous case. Thus, the
    controller in this case tries to track the soil moisture set point from some higher
    values thereby ensuring less yield deficiency. A summary of the results is given
    in Table 3. In this case, we can see that the closed-loop and the open-loop schemes
    give very similar crop yield while the closed-loop scheme uses slightly (0.8%)
    less water. 4.2.2. Scenario 2: Dry Weather In this scenario, we consider that
    the amount of rain in the current crop season is significantly less than the total
    historical rain data. In this set of simulations, we consider that there is 79.44
    cm of rain in the crop growing season. As in the previous scenario, we first consider
    a water saving mode in the scheduler. The scheduler and controller settings are
    the same as in the previous scenario. A summary of the results is given in Table
    4. It can be observed that the closed-loop scheme saves more (2.3%) water relative
    to the open-loop scheme at the cost of (8.2%) less yield. Table 4. Simulation

    prescribed by scheduler (cm3/cm2) 1092.50 993.56 1273.70 1245.10 We also consider
    a similar case like in the previous scenario to put less weight on water conservation.
    The results are summarized in Table 4. From the table, a similar conclusion can
    be drawn. That is, the closed-loop scheme is able to use (2.5%) less water but
    at a cost of (5.9%) less yield. To understand the effects of weights in the scheduling
    optimization, let us look at the results of the same scheduling scheme (closed-loop
    or open-loop) in different operating modes (more water conservation and less water
    conservation). From Table 3 (columns 2 and 4), it can be observed that when the
    objective in the closed-loop scheduler is changed to consider less water conservation,
    an increase of 54.24% in yield can be achieved with the cost of a 23.46% increase
    of water usage under the favorable weather condition. From Table 3 (columns 3
    and 5), it can be seen that an increase of 53.52% in yield can be achieved with
    the cost of a 20.07% increase of water usage for the open-loop scheduler under
    the favorable weather condition. This may imply that the yield is more sensitive
    to the weights and a relatively smaller change in the consumption of irrigation
    water may result a much larger change in the yield. A similar pattern can be observed
    from the results of Table 4 for the dry weather condition. In addition to the
    above cases, we consider another case in which the water price varies. The water
    price is increased in the relatively dry season between week 10 and 15 corresponding
    to day 70 and 105. The corresponding Qs2 value changes according to the price
    as follows: (36) The results are shown in Figure 9 for the closed-loop integrated
    scheme and in Figure 10 for the open-loop irrigation scheme. A summary of the
    result is given in Table 5. The result shows that less water is used relatively
    to open-loop scheme. In the figures, it can be observed that a tendency to use
    more water when water price is low presents. The soil moisture set point before
    day 60 is around 0.3 cm/cm. This creates a water storage that later is used when
    the water price increases. It can be observed that the actual irrigation during
    day 59 drops to zero since the soil moisture set point gets reduced. In this case,
    the closed-loop scheme leads to a 5.3% water saving but at the cost of 5.2% crop
    yield reduction. Figure 9 Figure 9. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling
    scheme under dry weather scenario with varying water price. Figure 10 Figure 10.

    SECTIONSJump To In this work, we investigated closed-loop scheduling together
    with closed-loop control for agriculture irrigation. In the proposed design, LPV
    models were identified and used in the design of the scheduler and the controller.
    The designed hierarchical scheduling and control system is applied to a field
    with maize. In the simulations, a couple of different weather scenarios were considered.
    Within each scenario, a few different cases were studied including different weights
    on water conservation and varying water prices. From the simulation results, we
    can observe that the gain (either in water conservation or crop yield) in closed-loop
    scheduling in most of the cases comes with a cost (either lower crop yield or
    increased water consumption). The results in the simulations considered do not
    show a very clear benefit of using closed-loop scheduling. One possible reason
    for the results is that the crop maize considered in this work requires significant
    water in the growing season. It may have a much stronger impact on the irrigation
    pattern than the impacts of uncertainty in weather and model. This may have caused
    the irrigation to be high in most of the growing season, as can be seen in the
    simulation results, and thus makes the difference between closed-loop scheduling
    and open-loop scheduling not obvious. Moreover, in this work, the spatial heterogeneity
    is not considered, and the field only includes maize. When spatial heterogeneity
    and more types of crops are considered, the benefits of a closed-loop scheduling
    may be more obvious. Further, in this work, we have only considered the soil moisture
    as a controlled variable, when other manipulated inputs (e.g., salinity) are considered,
    closed-loop scheduling may bring more benefits. In our future work, we will consider
    different crops other than maize. Spatial heterogeneity and other manipulated
    inputs will also be considered. Author Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Corresponding

    Get rights and content Highlights • Development of a Smart Irrigation Decision
    Support System, for precision agriculture. • The developed system estimates the
    weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, based on soil and climatic variables.
    • Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert on three commercial
    plantations. Abstract In this paper, an automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support
    System, SIDSS, is proposed to manage irrigation in agriculture. Our system estimates
    the weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil measurements
    and climatic variables gathered by several autonomous nodes deployed in field.
    This enables a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system
    to local perturbations and estimation errors. Two machine learning techniques,
    PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. Our approach is
    validated on three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East
    of Spain. Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert. Previous

    optimisationMachine learning 1. Introduction The efficient use of water in agriculture
    is one of the most important agricultural challenges that modern technologies
    are helping to achieve. In arid and semiarid regions, the differences between
    precipitation and irrigation water requirements are so big that irrigation management
    is a priority for sustainable and economically profitable crops (IDAE, 2005).
    To accomplish this efficient use, expert agronomists rely on information from
    several sources (soil, plant and atmosphere) to properly manage the irrigation
    requirements of the crops (Puerto et al., 2013). This information is defined by
    a set of variables, which can be measured using sensors, that are able to characterise
    the water status of the plants and the soil in order to obtain their water requirements.
    While meteorological variables are representative of a large area and can be easily
    measured by a single sensor for a vast land extension, soil and plant variables
    have a large spatial variability. Therefore, in order to use these parameters
    to effectively schedule the irrigation of the plants, multiple sensors are needed
    (Naor et al., 2001). Weather is one of the key factors being used to estimate
    the water requirements of the crops (Allen et al., 1998). Moreover, it is very
    frequent that public agronomic management organisms have weather stations spread
    around the different regions. These weather stations usually provide information
    of key variables for the agriculture like reference evapotranspiration (ET0) or
    the Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) that are of great importance to calculate the
    water requirements of the crops. Using variables related to the climate is the
    most common approach to create crop water requirement models (Jensen et al., 1970,
    Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Using these models, based on solely
    meteorological variables, a decision-making system can determine how a given crop
    will behave (Guariso et al., 1985). However, not all the regions have access to
    an extensive network of weather stations or they may not be nearby a given crop,
    thus the local micro-climates are not taken into account if only these parameters
    are used. Besides, irrigation models based only on climate parameters rely on
    an open loop structure. This means that the model is subject to stochastic events
    and it may not be able to correct the local perturbations that can occur when
    a unexpected weather phenomenon occurs (for instance irrigate the crop when it’s
    already raining) (Dutta et al., 2014, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015). Finally,
    monitoring other variables, such as hydrodynamic soil factors or water drainage,
    might increase the chances that the irrigation predicted by the models is properly
    used by the plants (Kramer and Boyer, 1995). Therefore, the usage of sensors that
    measures the soil water status is a key complement to modulate the water requirements
    of the crops. Soil variables, such as soil moisture content or soil matric potential,
    are considered by many authors as crucial part of scheduling tools for managing
    irrigation (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). The information
    from soil sensors can be used to create better decision models with closed loop
    structures that adapt to weather and soil perturbations (Cardenas-Lailhacar and
    Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). This practice, however, has not been widely
    adopted due to the technological limitations of available soil sensors, which
    required measured information to be registered and stored, traditionally using
    wired dataloggers, and limiting the installation flexibility and the real time
    interaction. This has changed recently with new generation sensors and sensor
    networks that are more versatile and suited to the agricultural environment (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015). Combining climate and soil variables has therefore potential to
    properly manage irrigation in a more efficient way than other traditional approaches.
    However, it also entails a series of challenges related with the increased amount
    of data flow, its analysis and its use to create effective models, in particular
    when data provided by different sources may seem contradictory and/or redundant.
    Traditionally, this analysis and modelling is performed by a human expert who
    interprets the different variables. The need of a human agronomist expert is required
    due to the complexity introduced by the soil spatial variability, crop species
    variability and their irrigation requirements over the growth cycle (Maton et
    al., 2005), which require comparing crops models and local context variables to
    determine the specific water requirements to achieve a certain goal at a particular
    location. The complexity of this problem and the different sources of variability
    makes than even the best model may deviate from the prediction, which favours
    the use of close loop control systems combining soil and climate sensors over
    open loop systems as a way to compensate possible deviations in future predictions.
    Human expertise has been proved effective to assist irrigation management but
    it is not scalable and available to every field, farm and crop and it is slow
    in the analysis of the data and real time processing. Instead, applying machine
    learning techniques to replace the manual models and to assist expert agronomists
    allows the viability of creating automatic Irrigation Decision Support System.
    Machine learning techniques have been used previously to estimate relevant parameters
    of the crop (Sreekanth et al., 2015). Giusti and Marsili-Libelli(2015) present
    a fuzzy decision systems to predict the volumetric water content of the soil based
    on local climate data. Adeloye et al. (2012), proposed the use of unsupervised
    artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the evapotranspiration also based
    on weather information solely. King and Shellie (2016) used NN modelling to estimate
    the lower threshold temperature (Tnws) needed to calculate the crop water stress
    index for wine grapes. In Campos et al. (2016) the authors presented a new algorithm
    designed to estimate the total available water in the soil root zone of a vineyard
    crop, using only SWC sensors, which are very dependent of the location. Taking
    advantage of the soil information, Valdés-Vela et al., 2015, Abrisqueta et al.,
    2015 incorporates the volumetric soil water content, manually collected with a
    neutron probe, to agro-meteorological data. This information is then fed into
    a fuzzy logic system to estimate the stem water potential. Other approaches in
    the literature also make use of machine learning techniques – such as principal
    component analysis, unsupervised clustering, and ANN – to estimate the irrigation
    requirements in crops. However they do not specify the quantity of water needed
    (Dutta et al., 2014), they reduce the prediction to true or false, and/or they
    are based on open loop structures (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015, Jensen et
    al., 1970, Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004), only considering the weather
    information and, therefore, unable to correct deviations from their predictions.
    This paper proposes an automated decision support system to manage the irrigation
    on a certain crop field, based on both climatic and soil variables provided by
    weather stations and soil sensors. As discussed, we postulate that the usage of
    machine learning techniques with the weather and soil variables is of great importance
    and can help to achieve a fully automated close loop system able to precisely
    predict the irrigation needs of a crop. Our presented system is evaluated by comparing
    it against the irrigations reports provided by an agronomist specialist during
    a complete season in different fields. 2. System structure An irrigation advice
    system is based on the concept of predicting the waters needs of the crops in
    order to irrigate them properly. Traditionally this decision has been taken by
    an experienced farmer or an expert agricultural technician. Fig. 1 shows the flow
    diagram of which the proposed system is based. Download : Download high-res image
    (82KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the proposed
    system. In this schema, an expert agronomist is in charge of analysing the information
    from different sources: Weather stations located near the crops that collect meteorological
    data, Crop and Soil characteristics (type, age, size, cycle, etc.) and Soil sensors
    installed in the crop fields. The expert analyses the information to provide an
    irrigation report, which indicates the amount of water needed to irrigate properly
    the crops in the upcoming week. To make this decision making process manageable,
    the information needed to create the irrigation report on the next week is only
    the information of the current week. Based on this concept, our Smart Irrigation
    Decision Support System (SIDSS) is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance
    and validity of our approach, the decision system will use the same information
    used by the expert agronomist and will output the water requirements for the upcoming
    week. This will ensure a fair comparison between the decisions taken by a human
    expert and the SIDSS. To accomplish this, the machine learning system must be
    trained with historical data and irrigations reports of the agronomist, using
    the irrigation decisions taken in these reports as the groundtruth of the system.
    The aim of the system is to be as accurate as possible to this groundtruth. Several
    machine learning techniques were applied and evaluated to achieve the best performance.

    The Irrigation Decision System is composed of three main components: a collection
    device that gathers information from the soil sensors, weather stations that provide
    agrometeorological information and the SIDSS that, when trained correctly, is
    able to predict the irrigation requirements of the crops for the incoming week.

    2.1. Collection device and soil sensors The information from the soil sensors
    is gathered using our own developed device that has been proved to be completely
    functional for irrigation management in different crops and conditions (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015). This device is wireless, equipped with a GSM/GPRS modem, and is
    completely autonomous, so that the installation procedures are accessible to any
    farmer. Fig. 3 shows the collection device installed in a lemon crop field located
    in the South-East of Spain. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Device installed in a lemon crop field. The
    device allows to fully configure the recording rates of all the embedded sensors.
    In our experiments, a sampling rate of 15 min was set, since this gives a good
    balance between providing enough information to support a correct agronomic decision
    and maintaining the autonomy of the device with the equipped solar panel and battery
    (López Riquelme et al., 2009, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015. The information is
    received, processed and stored in a relational database. 2.1.1. Soil sensors The
    soil control variables used to provide SIDSS with relevant information are matric
    potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv), which are common in irrigation
    management (Jones, 2004). By using these variables, the irrigation can be scheduled
    for maintaining soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity
    in order to satisfy the required crop water requirements. Likewise, they can be
    used to maintain soil water content or soil matric potential under certain reference
    values proper of regulated deficit irrigation strategies. Both Ψm and θv are used
    to decide the irrigation frequency and to adjust the gross irrigation doses. Soil
    matric potential was measured with MPS-2 sensors (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman,
    WA 99163 – USA), while volumetric soil water content was measured with both 10-HS
    (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) and Enviroscan (Sentek Pty. Ltd.,
    Adelaide, Australia) sensors. Besides both previous soil sensors, another sensor
    is used. A pluviometer (Rain-o173-matic small, Pronamic Ltd., Ringkøbing, Denmark)
    was used under the dripper to provide accurate estimation of the amount of water
    applied and the irrigation run time. The information provided by this sensor was
    used to ensure that the farmer is following the instruction of the agronomic reports
    provided by the expert. Table 2 summarises the variables measured by the soils
    sensors. Table 2. Soil sensors technical information. Sensor Measured data Variable

    Weather stations Experiments took place in the Region of Murcia, Spain. In this
    region, there is a network of 45 agro-meteorological stations located in irrigated
    areas, the Agricultural Information Network System of Murcia (SIAM), funded by
    the EU and installed to help estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and
    the irrigation needs of crops after a severe drought between 1979 and 1985. The
    variables measured by the stations are the following: Temperature (T), Relative
    humidity (RH), Global radiation (GR), Wind speed (WS), Rainfall (RF), Dew point
    (DP), Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD). These variables, measured by the different
    stations, are publicly available and can be downloaded from the SIAM website (SIAM,
    2015). The weather stations are tested and calibrated periodically according to
    the manufacturer’s specifications. The amount of water required to compensate
    the evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field is defined as crop water requirement.
    Therefore, knowing the reference crop evapotranspiration is of key importance
    to estimate the crop’s water requirements. Using the FAO Penman–Monteith formulation
    (Allen et al., 1998), the daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) can be
    calculated by means of the weather information. The crop evapotranspiration under
    standard condition (ETc) can be calculated using the single crop coefficient approach
    shown below: (1) where Kc is the crop coefficient and depends on multiple factors,
    namely, the crop type, climate, crop evaporation and soil growth stages. 2.3.
    Smart Irrigation Decision Support System The decision support system is the component
    in charge of taking the final decision on the amount of water to be irrigated,
    or equivalently, the number of minutes to irrigate considering constant water
    flow. This decision is taken automatically on the basis of the information provided
    by the sensors and the usage of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques.
    The aim of this component, therefore, is to mimic a human expert in the decision
    making process of weekly optimising the irrigation, which could assist the farmer.
    Applying machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) allow us to visualise the information to
    perform an initial exploratory analysis. Fig. 4 shows the LDA of the input, array
    containing the sensorial variables, and output, the estimated irrigation time
    need, used in the system. The output was divided in classes (18), each one representing
    the weekly irrigation time by increments of 150 min, from 0 to 2700 min. From
    this figure, it can be noticed that discrete classification in classes will be
    hard to accomplish due to the high number of classes necessary to precisely quantise
    the irrigation estimation. This is due to the fact that the variable to estimate
    – either the amount of water or the watering time-has an intrinsic continuous
    nature, since the expected output can take any real value between 0 and infinity.
    Therefore, conventional classifiers aiming categorical outputs – such as LDA (Fisher,
    1938), SVM (Belousov et al., 2002), and ANN are not optimal for this application.
    Instead, methodologies based on regression (Wold et al., 1984), and/or fuzzy logic
    (Zadeh et al., 1996) allow us to estimate a more suited continuous variable. Download

    Linear discriminant analysis for 18 irrigation time intervals. In this section,
    we propose two different techniques, each belonging to one of the previous families,
    to estimate the weekly required amount of water. As described in the introduction
    and experimental sections, both modelling techniques require a supervised training
    set in order to learn the irrigation model. 2.3.1. Partial least square regression
    Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) (Wold et al., 2001) is a statistical method
    that seeks the fundamental relations between predictor and response variables.
    Predictor variables, X, are defined as the observable variables that can be measured
    and input into the decision system. Response variable Y are the outputs or estimates
    that must be deducted from the input. The relationship between both variable sets,
    and linear multivariate regression model, is found by projecting both predicted
    and observable variables into a new space, where latent variables are estimated
    to model the covariance structure between the predictor space and the observation
    space. This PLSR model is developed from a training set D = {X, Y} of S samples,
    which is composed of the predictor matrix X = [x1, … , xi, … , xS]T and the response
    matrix Y = [y1, … , yi, … , yS]T. xi is a column vector of K elements, that can
    contain all the sensor and weather variables measured at a given week i: (2) and
    yi is another column vector of M elements, containing the corresponding variables
    to be estimated at that week i. Since in our application this is only the irrigation
    time recommended at that week, yi is reduced to a scalar and M = 1: PLSR constructs
    new predictor latent variables, known as components, which are linear combinations
    of the original predictor observable variables. These components are created to
    explain the observed variability in the original predictor variables, while simultaneously
    considering the response variable. That is, the estimated latent variables are
    linear combinations of predictor variables that have higher covariance with Y.
    Using the latent variables leads to a regression models able to fit the response
    variable with fewer components. The PLSR learning model can be expressed as: (3)
    (4) where T and U are the projections – aka scores – of X and Y into a smaller
    L-dimensional latent space respectively, P and Q are the orthogonal projection
    matrices – aka loading matrices – and E and G the error residuals. P and Q can
    be obtained by eigendecomposition of the original matrices. Since the X-scores
    T are meant to be good predictors of Y, it can be approximated that: (5) Being
    F a new residual. This reduces the problem to find a set of weights W such that
    T = X ∗ W predicts X and Y reasonably well. As mentioned, these orthogonal coefficients
    should maximise the correlation between X and Y while explaining the variance
    of X: (6) P and Q can be solved by applying a Least Square Estimator (LSE) so:
    (7) (8) Finally, by rewriting the previous equation, it can be derived that: (9)
    Being B the PLSR regression coefficients. Once these coefficients have been learned,
    responses y∗ for new observation x∗ can be estimated by applying the learning
    model: (10) assuming an estimation error f. We favour the use of PLSR among other
    regression techniques due to its suitability when the number of predictors is
    bigger than the number of response variables, the responses are noisy and there
    is a high probability of having multicollinearity among the predictor variables.
    The multicollinear phenomenon happens when those variable are highly correlated,
    due to redundancy between sensors and or between meteorological factors. As it
    can be noticed, all these factors appear in our irrigation problem. 2.3.2. Adaptive
    neuro fuzzy inference systems Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) (Jang,
    1993) is a fuzzy inference system for systematically generating fuzzy rules from
    a given input/output D dataset. This machine learning technique combines advantages
    from fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. On the one hand, it allows us
    to represent an element not only into categories but also into a certain degree
    of membership functions, which allows mimicking the characteristics of human reasoning
    and decision making. On the one hand, it can be trained and so can self-improve
    in order to adjust the membership functions parameters directly from data (Wang
    et al., 2006). The ANFIS architecture consists in a five-layer feedforward neural
    network (Fig. 5) whose parameters are updated using a combination of gradient
    descent and LSE in a two-pass learning algorithm. Download : Download high-res
    image (95KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Example of ANFIS architecture
    for a input x with K variables and a 1-variable output y. In a first forward pass
    step, neuron outputs are calculated layer by layer and some internal consequent
    parameters are identified by the least squares estimator (LSE) to obtain the final
    single output. The forward pass operation at layer 1 defines the fuzzy membership
    for each input variable X. Assuming a Gaussian distribution function , the output
    of this layer is given by: (11) Layer 2 is a multiplicative layer, which calculates
    the firing strength of the rules as a product of the previous membership grades.
    (12) Layer 3 is a normalising layer, where: (13) Layer 4 applies a node function:
    (14) where and are consequent parameters estimated using LSE. Finally, layer 5
    is the output layer that provides the overall estimation y as a summation of all
    incoming signals. For the case M = 1, where only one output variable is estimated:
    (15) After the forward pass has been completed, an initial estimation is provided
    by the ANFIS network. Since initial premise parameters are initialised randomly,
    the initial estimation will differ greatly from the desired values Y. This error
    or difference between the desired output y and the estimated output for a given
    training sample {xi, yi} can be expressed as: (16) To correct this deviation,
    a second learning step, or backward pass, attempts to minimise the estimated error
    by modifying the value of the premise parameters until the desired and estimated
    outputs are similar. This process is performed using backpropagation, where the
    error is propagated back over the layers and decomposed into the different nodes
    using the chain rule. Gradient descend is used as optimisation technique to update
    the premise parameters while the consequent parameters are kept fixed until the
    next iteration. This double step learning process is repeated iteratively for
    every single sample in the training set until the estimated error is smaller than
    a given threshold, i.e. convergence is achieved, or a maximum number of iterations
    – epocs – are reached. The ANFIS implementation used in this work is taken from
    the Fuzzy logic toolbox (Inc, 2016), by Mathworks where the parameter Radii used
    to train was a scalar of value 0.75 and the average number of epochs used to train
    was 1500. 3. Experimental setup The system was evaluated in three commercial plantations
    of lemon trees in the Region of Murcia, located in the semiarid zone of the South-East
    of Spain where the water is very scarce and drip irrigation is commonly used.
    The irrigation criteria followed was to maximise the yield. Plantation 1. Fino
    lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. Fil cv. 49) on Citrus macrophylla Wester, growing
    in a soil with a low water retention capacity. The soil is characterised by a
    deep and homogeneous sandy – clay – loam texture. The irrigation water had an
    electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The orchard consist of 11 year old
    lemon trees with an average height of 3.5 m. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m, with
    an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m apart)
    were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides of
    each tree. One sensor node was installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, with a soil matric
    potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a
    depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of 20, 40 and 80 cm
    (Enviroscan, Sentek Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) located 20 cm from a representative
    dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. According to the nearest weather station of
    SIAM, located about 5 km from the orchard, the climate was typically Mediterranean.
    Thus, over this period (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 210 mm and
    ET0 was 1395 mm. The average wind speed was 1.66 m/s, generally light wind and
    sometimes moderate. Plantation 2 and 3. 40 and 35 year old lemon trees (C. limon
    L. Burm. Fil) cv. Fino and cv. Verna respectively, grafted on sour orange (Citrus
    aurantium L.), growing in a soil with a medium water retention capacity. The soil
    is clay sandy loam texture and the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity
    (EC) of 1600 μS cm−1 during all season except in summer which was of 2285 μS cm−1.
    The tree spacing was 7.0 m × 6.75 m and 6.75 m × 6.75 m and the average ground
    coverage about 57% and 50%, respectively. One drip irrigation line was used for
    each tree row. There were 8 and 6 emitters of 4 L h−1 per tree, respectively.
    One sensor node was installed in the Fino orchard (≈15 ha) and another in Verna
    orchard (≈23 ha), each with two soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices,
    Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a depth of 25 and 45 cm and three soil moisture
    sensors at a depth of 25, 45 and 70 cm (10HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman,
    WA 99163) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and the vertical canopy
    projection. According to the nearest SIAM’s weather station, located about 7 km
    from the orchards, the climate was also typically Mediterranean. Over this period
    (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 150 mm and ET0 was 1250 mm. The average
    wind speed was 1.4 m/s, i.e. light wind generally. The decision of selecting these
    three plantations is based on the fact that all of them are mature lemon trees
    and therefore their water irrigation requirement differences depend mainly of
    environmental conditions (soil and atmosphere) rather than the plant. Besides,
    all the plantations use drip emitters of 4 L h−1 so estimating the irrigation
    runtime of the week instead of the water volume will be a correct approach. Drip
    irrigation provides a fixed volume of water per hour; the pressure is maintained
    using pressure compensating emitters. The Irrigation frequency is calculated taking
    into account that only a certain amount of water depletion is allowed before the
    next replenishment is scheduled. Thus, the run time (gross irrigation dose) is
    determined to be equivalent to the previous amount of water depletion. The experts
    only need to calculate the irrigation run time (minutes) and the number of watering
    times per week or day depending on the time of year or crop development stage.
    The main goal of the system, also reflected by the expert agronomist in his reports,
    is to maximise the yield (maximum production per crop surface) with an optimum
    water management. Since information from the weather stations, soil sensors and
    crops characteristics has different sampling periods, the first step is pre-process
    this information. After analysing several methods and time intervals it was decided
    that the best option was to calculate the week average value for each of the sensors
    or weather stations variable except for the rainfall where the total amount of
    rainfall during the week is used instead. The week average fits better than others
    method like the daily average due to the fact, that the irrigation reports from
    the expert agronomist are already fixed, limited and done weekly. Besides, adding
    more input will make the data sparser, making more difficult to find patterns
    in the feature space, requiring a higher amount of data to train the system accordingly.
    The input obtained will be a one dimensional vector xi for each week in which
    the columns are the different variables or inputs of our system. The target vector
    will be the water requirements of the crops in the following week yi. This information
    has been extracted from the agronomist expert weekly reports in order to be used
    as groundtruth for comparison as for supervising the learning process. Three datasets
    are available, each dataset represent a different plantation. Data was collected
    from January 2014 until June 2015. Each plantation dataset has 74 weeks of data,
    which makes a total of 224 weeks of data. To accomplish a proper analysis of the
    system, we have divided the experiment in two different scenarios. Both scenarios
    differ from the other on the training and testing split. Two machine learning
    methods are applied on each scenario, a method based on PLSR and a method based
    on ANFIS. The performances of both methods in the different scenarios are analysed.
    4. Experimental results and discussion 4.1. Scenario 1 In this scenario, we aim
    to successfully predict the irrigation needs of one or several plantation, based
    on the information provided by the collection device and learned knowledge from
    a historical archive of the previous year irrigation reports. This is of obvious
    usefulness in real life. We will demonstrate this capability by predicting the
    irrigation needs of year 2015 for the three plantations based on the information
    of the year 2014. The training set is therefore composed by all 2014 weeks of
    data belonging the three plantations, while the test set is composed by all 2015
    weeks belonging to the three plantations. The information given to the system,
    or input vector, is a critical part of the design. On the one hand using unnecessary
    features may make the system perform poorly due to redundant information and noise.
    On the other hand, using too few features may not provide all the required information.
    Therefore, among all the available features explained in Table 1, they will not
    all be necessary. Table 3 shows the features subsets selected for each test. Among
    all possible sets of features, only combinations with logical sense, according
    to an expert agronomist were chosen a priori for the different experiments. Performance
    of the different sets is shown in Fig. 6. Table 3. Features subset and variables

    sets of variables for linear regression and ANFIS. The set that accomplish the
    best performance for both methods is F6, with and error of 155.1 and 121.1 min
    week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. In order to put this error into context,
    it can be noticed that 2.5 extra hours of irrigation represent around 10% of the
    total time in summer months – and up to 20% in spring and autumn months, being
    10% error considered as an acceptable error in agriculture (Bos et al., 2004).
    Therefore, this feature set F6 will be the input vector of the system. It can
    be noticed that including the rain as input of the system (F7), increases the
    error. In the Region of Murcia, the rainfall are extremely low (around 210 mm
    per year) and usually being concentrated in a few days of the year, being the
    weekly total rain in most cases 0. With this information only available for the
    year 2014, the system didn’t have enough information to be trained properly and
    developed in unpredictable results. However we understand that in other regions
    the rainfall could be really useful to increase the performance of the system.
    Besides, considering the water retention capabilities of the soil, part of the
    rainfalls would be considered in the next irrigation report. Fig. 7 shows the
    water irrigation pattern over time predicted by the PLSR and ANFIS respectively
    when using feature set 6. Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download

    using soil and weather information for the different plantations (Plantation 1:
    Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The weekly errors
    for predicting the irrigation needs during the year 2015 in the three plantations
    are 155.1 and 121.1 min week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. The standard deviation
    for PLSR is 120.7. In the case of ANFIS, the standard deviation is 105.2. The
    total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops in the three plantations in
    2015 is 65,641 min. ANFIS method estimates this value in 60,506 min and PLSR estimates
    63,240 min. As conclusion, ANFIS performance is better than PLSR for each individual
    week water requirement estimation. However, PLSR estimation also follows the irrigation
    pattern accurately and estimates the total amount of water required more accurately
    over time than ANFIS, which seems to be more conservative in the water usage.
    Looking at the higher peaks of water requirement in the graphs, PLSR may overestimate
    the water needs while ANFIS is more accurate in general. It is important to note
    that in agronomy the most important point is not only the amount of water plants
    need but when they need it (Allen et al., 1998). Following this criterion, the
    performance of ANFIS is much better than PLSR for this scenario. Another factor
    that is important to analyse in this research is the use of soil sensors in addition
    to weather stations to close the loop. We consider that using this kind of sensors
    to estimate the water requirements of the crops improves the accuracy of the estimation
    and helps to deal with local disturbances. Since this is one of our main contributions
    and differences with other proposed automatic irrigation systems, a detailed analysis
    of the contribution of these variables is needed to validate our hypotheses and
    facilitate comparison with previous research systems. Therefore, the input vector
    was changed, using only weather information to train the system and predict the
    irrigation time. Table 4 shows the weekly average error for different sets of
    input vectors. Table 4. Summary of the performance of the different subsets. System

    irrigation pattern using weather information for the different plantations (Plantation
    1: Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The error in
    PLSR using only weather information is 175.3 min week−1 with a standard deviation
    of 147.6. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 159.6 min week−1 with a standard
    deviation of 146.6. Although in general the shape of the graph is quite similar
    to the one using both soil and weather. The use of soil sensors gives a fine adjustment
    increasing the accuracy of the estimation for both PLSR and ANFIS reasoning engines.
    It can be concluded that a much better performance in the weekly irrigation estimation
    (around a 22% smaller weekly average error) is achieved when adding soils sensor
    information to the weather information. Next, a cross-validation strategy is applied
    to the scenario to validate how the results will generalise to an independent
    dataset. In cross validation, the complete dataset of the three plantations is
    divided in training and testing sets. The method used to cross-validate the information
    is Leave one out (LoO CV), a particular case of the Leave-p-out cross-validation
    (LpO CV). Kohavi, 1995, Picard and Cook, 1984 that involves using 1 observation
    as the testing set and the remaining observations as the training set. This process
    is repeated the number of samples times (n) changing the test sample each time
    to validate the system with all the samples. Cross validation method was used
    for both PLSR and ANFIS. Fig. 9 shows the results of this LoO Cross-Validation
    method for PLSR and ANFIS respectively using the set F6 as input vector. Download

    deviation of 153.2. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 87.6 min week−1 with a
    standard deviation of 102.9. The total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops
    for the 189 weeks in the three plantations is 214,020 min. The ANFIS method estimates
    this value on 213,180 min and PLSR estimates 213,960 min. Table 5 summarises the
    result of the experiments. Table 5. Scenario 1 results summary. Results Average

    Similar conclusions are extracted using Cross-Validation. Both PLSR and ANFIS
    systems are really close to the groundtruth in the total amount of water estimated
    but it is clear that ANFIS performs much better than PLSR if we consider the weekly
    error. It is also confirmed that using soil sensors in addition to weather information
    results in a better performance for both ANFIS and PLSR methods. The improvement
    on ANFIS performance during cross validation is explained by the larger amount
    of training data regarding the “predict 2015” experiment. This behaviour is expected
    due to the nature of neural networks, which require large amount of data to be
    trained in comparison with other machine learning techniques and we predict than
    having a historical archive longer for training could results in a further improvement.
    Although we are validating our systems with the three plantations described before
    as case of study, in principle, our methodology has been designed to be independent
    of the crop, terrain and location of the plantation, aiming to propose a general
    close-loop automatic irrigation estimator. In practical terms, this means that
    to apply our system to new plantations, training data in the form of sensor and
    weather weekly data as well as irrigation reports provided by and expert agronomist
    for the new plantation will be needed. Since these reports can be expensive and
    compiling a substantial amount of weekly reports is time consuming and must be
    planned in advance, it is important to know how big the dataset must be and how
    the performance may improve with the number of training weeks. Therefore, as final
    experiment to obtain an estimation of the required amount of training data for
    a new crop/plantation, the complete dataset was divided in different percentages
    of training and testing. Fig. 10 shows the weekly error of both PLSR and ANFIS
    methods with respect to the training dataset percentage. Download : Download high-res
    image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Performance comparison
    for linear regression and ANFIS with respect to the % of samples used to train.
    According to the figure, it is noticeable that ANFIS performance is much better
    than PLSR if there are enough samples to train the system. In cases where the
    percentage of samples for training is low (less than 25% of the data, i.e. less
    than 4 months of data for a given field), PLSR overperforms ANFIS. This case is
    relevant for new plantations without historical data of previous reports. In such
    situations, the PLSR predictive model may be used in early stages, before switching
    to ANFIS once enough samples to train the system properly are collected. 4.2.
    Scenario 2 The goal is to predict the irrigation of a plantation based on its
    weather and soil measured variables but using a SIDSS system trained exclusively
    with other fields. This will be the hardest scenario as it will be necessary to
    predict the irrigation needs of a field with no previous irrigation reports of
    that specific plantation. This scenario attempts to show the potential of our
    methodology to create a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop – in our
    case, lemon trees – for any given plantation, independently of the location and/or
    terrain. A lower performance can be expected in comparison to what could be achieved
    by retraining the system with information of the plantation (scenario 1), which
    is sacrificed for the benefit of not having to generate manual irrigation report
    for new plantations. Cross validation, specifically leave-one_plantation-out is
    applied in validation. Thus, 2014 and 2015 data from two of the plantations are
    used for training, while the remaining plantation data (2014 + 2015) is used for
    testing. This is repeated 3 times, leaving a different plantation out of the training
    set each time, and the results averaged. Table 6 shows the error and standard
    deviation of this scenario for PLSR and ANFIS using different features vector
    used to compare the performance. Table 6. Scenario 2 results summary. Method Features

    156.5 126.9 234.8 192.6 197.4 153.2 The best feature vector F6 used in scenario
    1 is used as input. In this case PLSR outperforms ANFIS with an average error
    of 257.0 min in comparison with 323.3 min for ANFIS. However, we noticed that,
    in this scenario, removing the VWC1 sensor results in a better performance for
    both methods as a universal estimator. This is explained because the VWC sensor
    is very dependent on the soil where it is installed and, as both algorithms were
    trained with a sensor installed in a different plantation than the one that is
    predicting, the provided information introduces noise and does not help the system
    to estimate properly the water need. This does not happen, however, with the SWP
    sensor, which quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another
    in the soil and it is less dependent on the soil installed. Removing the VWC sensor
    results in a better performance of the system obtaining an average weekly error
    of 194.4 min with PLSR and 197.4 min with ANFIS. This result proves that there
    is certain potential to develop a universal estimator using our system for a given
    crop, although this means an increase of the average error. This error could be
    reduced if more than 2 plantations of the same crop were available for training.
    Both PLSR and ANFIS performs similarly, being PLSR slightly better. 5. Conclusions
    This paper describes the design and development of an automatic decision support
    system to manage irrigation in agriculture. The main characteristic of system
    is the use of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to
    precisely predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works
    that are based only on weather variables or doesn’t specify the quantity of water
    required by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil parameters
    in a closed loop control scheme allows adapting the decision support system to
    local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive
    weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS
    has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system
    is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision
    support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been
    proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain
    the best performance. The experiments have taken place in three commercial plantations
    of citrus trees located in the South-East of Spain. A first experimental scenario
    shows a comparison of the system’s performance using soil sensors in addition
    to the weather information for predicting year 2015 using 2014 information to
    train the system. The usage of soil sensor in the three plantations accomplished
    a 22% less of weekly error in comparison to the performance of using only weather
    information. A second scenario shows the potential of our system as universal
    estimator for a given crop, i.e. the use case of installing the system in a new
    plantation, not having previous information of it. For this application, VWC sensors
    should be removed due to their high dependence with the soil type. Although, as
    expected, the estimation error increases in this scenario, it does not require
    historical data from agronomical reports to be retrained, which implies a significant
    advantage, in particular for new plantations in early stages. If more training
    data from a bigger variety of field were available, a better performance in this
    scenario could be expected. Another possible improvement for this scenario will
    be the addition of a VWC to get a better performance than using only the matric
    potential sensors. However, in order to use the VWC sensor in this scenario, a
    precise study of the soil textures of the plantation will be required to extrapolate
    the VWC sensor information to similar soil textures where the DSS was trained.
    For future research, we aim to extend and evaluate the system in plantations different
    than citrus and analyse the performance under several conditions and regions.
    Thus, adding the weather forecast as input of the SIDSS could help to improve
    the next week irrigation schedule and consider the predicted rainfall in our estimation.
    Similarly, past rainfall information, that did not prove beneficial in our system
    due to the region of Murcia characteristics, may become a good factor to improve
    the accuracy of the system in regions with a more regular and predictable raining
    pattern. We also aim to capture a bigger dataset that will allow us to generate
    more general models towards a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop.
    This dataset will also explore the use of multiple sensors per plantation in order
    to address inhomogeneous ground conditions in the different plantation as well
    as provide more input information to the system for a better reasoning. Acknowledgements

    content Abstract In-field sensor-based site-specific irrigation management is
    of benefit to producers for efficient water management. Integration of the decision
    making process with the controls is a viable option for determining when and where
    to irrigate, and how much water to apply. This research presents the design of
    decision support software and its integration with an in-field wireless sensor
    network (WSN) to implement site-specific sprinkler irrigation control via Bluetooth
    wireless communication. Wireless in-field sensing and control (WISC) software
    was designed by four major design factors that provide real-time monitoring and
    control of both inputs (field data) and outputs (sprinkler controls) by simple
    click-and-play menu using graphical user interface (GUI), and optimized to adapt
    changes of crop design, irrigation pattern, and field location. The WISC software
    provides remote access to in-field micrometeorological information from the distributed
    WSN and variable-rate irrigation control. An algorithm for nozzle sequencing was
    developed to stagger nozzle-on operations so as evenly distributed over the 60-s
    cycle. Sensor-based closed-loop irrigation was highly correlated to catch can
    water with r2 = 0.98. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Introduction Efficient water management plays an important role in irrigated agricultural
    cropping systems. Many areas of agricultural fields are effectively over- or under-irrigated
    due to spatial variability in water infiltration and runoff of rainfall and irrigation,
    crop water use and irrigation depth. Under-irrigated areas are subject to water
    stress, resulting in production loss, while over-irrigated areas suffer from plant
    disease and nutrient leaching. A wireless sensor-based irrigation control system
    is a potential solution to optimize water management by remotely accessing in-field
    soil water conditions and site-specifically controlling irrigation sprinklers.
    The system requires seamless integration of the system input and output components,
    and software design for decision support and monitoring. Sensor-based irrigation
    systems have been studied for many applications (Stone et al., 1985, Jacobson
    et al., 1989, Zazueta and Smajstrla, 1992, Meron et al., 1995, Testezlaf et al.,
    1997). Stone et al. (1985) presented a computer-based monitoring system for continuous
    measurements of soil water potential. Zazueta and Smajstrla (1992) compared indirect
    estimates with direct measurement of soil moisture. Meron et al. (1995) used a
    control system for apple tree irrigation management using tensiometers. Testezlaf
    et al. (1997) used an automated irrigation control system for management of greenhouse
    container plants. A well-designed irrigation system is an essential requirement
    for a profitable and environmental friendly irrigation (Abreu and Pereira, 2002).
    Wireless radio frequency technology has provided opportunities to deploy wireless
    data communication in agricultural systems (Oksanen et al., 2004, Zhang, 2004,
    Lee et al., 2002). Software design for automated irrigation control has been studied
    by Abreu and Pereira (2002). They designed and simulated solid-set sprinkler irrigation
    systems by using ISADIM software that allowed to the design of a simplified layout
    of the irrigation system. However, their software provided limited control due
    to the lack of feedback in-field sensors. An automated irrigation system was proposed
    for remote in-field sensing and variable-rate irrigation control (Kim et al.,
    2008). The objective of this paper is to describe a user-friendly software design
    for decision support and monitoring of wireless sensor-based site-specific irrigation
    system. A schematic flowchart of an automated irrigation system for variable-rate
    irrigation is illustrated in Fig. 1. The system consists of machine conversion,
    localization, and mission planning. The first requirement is to convert a self-propelled
    irrigation machine from a conventional mechanical and hydraulic system to an electronically
    controllable system for individual sprinkler head control. Then, it is necessary
    to be able to continuously monitor the geographic location of the irrigation machine
    by a self-positioning system. Once the machine is controllable and accessible
    to its navigation, mission planning must decide when to irrigate and how much
    water each sprinkler head should apply at each location. This decision support
    process updates watering instructions according to the cart location and field
    soil water conditions monitored from sensors distributed across the field, and
    sends control signals to a nozzle controller at the irrigation machine. Download

    (WSN) A distributed WSN was developed for real-time in-field soil water content
    sensing (Kim et al., 2008). The network consisted of five sensing stations and
    a weather station. Each of the sensing stations contained a data logger (CR10,
    Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT), two soil water reflectometers (CS616, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) horizontally at the 30-cm and 61-cm soil depths each,
    and a soil temperature sensor (107, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) at the
    15-cm soil depth. The weather station measured precipitation, air temperature,
    relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and solar radiation. Sensors at
    the in-field sensing and weather stations were scanned every 10 s, and data were
    stored and wirelessly transmitted every 15 min via a Bluetooth radio transmitter
    (SD202, Initium Co., Korea) back to a base computer at a receiver (MSP-102a, Initium
    Co., Korea). All components at each station are self-powered by a 12-V battery
    that is recharged by a solar panel (SX5, Solarex, Sacramento, CA). The design
    for power management and wireless communication for the WSN was detailed by Kim
    et al. (2008). The wireless sensor network was configured via transmission control
    protocol (TCP)/internet protocol (IP) to create a virtual serial network. The
    Bluetooth master at a base station operates as a TCP server, while other seven
    Bluetooth slaves are registered into TCP data ports. The server receives data
    from all seven in-field sensor clients and sends the data to the base computer
    via Ethernet. A serial emulator provides virtual COM ports and redirects to TCP
    socket connection (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Virtual
    serial network. The receiver is configured as a multi-serial Bluetooth server
    and each Bluetooth device has virtual COM ports and redirected to TCP socket connection.
    2.1. Machine conversion A conventional irrigation machine needs conversion to
    adapt the in-field sensor-based variable-rate irrigation control. The machine
    used in the study was a ditch-feed, self-propelled linear-move irrigation system
    (Valmont Industries, Inc., Valley, NE) equipped with two different sprinkler application
    methods: mid-elevation spray application (MESA) and low energy precision application
    (LEPA) (Evans and Iversen, 2005). The irrigation system had six towers including
    the generator/pump/control cart located at the north end of the system. The machine
    moved at about 2 m/min at the 100% speed setting. The machine was converted to
    make sprinkler nozzles electronically and individually controllable by attaching
    a programmable logic controller (PLC), solenoids, air valves, GPS, and radio transmitter.
    The PLC (S7-226, Siemens, Johnson City, TN) was mounted on a main cart and activated
    electric solenoids (U8325B1V, ASCO, Florham Park, NJ) to control 30 banks (15
    for MESA banks and 15 for LEPA banks) of sprinklers via diaphragm valves (205,
    Bermad Inc., Anaheim, CA). The signal interface and software design for the PLC
    were detailed by Kim et al. (2008). The PLC updates the GPS position of the irrigation
    machine every second from a WAAS-enabled differential GPS (17HVS, Garmin, Olathe,
    KS) and wirelessly transmits the machine position to the base station via a Bluetooth
    radio transmitter. With feedback of in-field soil water conditions and the irrigation
    machine positions, the base station makes a real-time decision for site-specific
    irrigation and wirelessly sends individual sprinkler control signals to the PLC
    with a complete cycle of closed-loop control within a second via Bluetooth receiver.
    2.2. Cost of WSN The selection of the Bluetooth wireless system was based on communication
    range, data rate, and cost and intended to accommodate existing devices with plug-and-play
    type of wireless modules. The total cost of Bluetooth wireless modules used for
    in-field WSN was approximately $1200 for seven transmitters (five sensing, one
    weather, and one PLC control station) and one receiver (base station) as shown
    in Table 1. The cost of sensing and weather station depends on how many and which
    sensors are used at how many stations. A sensing station similar to what we used
    in this study costs approximately $800 for two soil moisture sensors, a soil temperature
    sensor, data logger, battery, and solar panel (Table 1). Table 1. System cost

    $1246 $2044 3. Software design factors There are many design choices to implement
    the closed-loop irrigation system. The design criterion of our software platform
    was how easy and efficiently end-users can use the software for comprehensive
    automation of their irrigation field. The growers want to see on the computer
    monitor at home the status of soil moisture at various locations including weather
    information and monitor irrigation operation by pulling up a map that sees how
    much water at where to apply or creating a new irrigation map by simple click-and-drag.
    During the irrigation, they may also want to see the current location of their
    irrigation machine, how far it went, and when it will reach the destination. If
    a rain shower passes over the field, they should be hoping the software to automatically
    adjust the amount of water being applied. To meet all grower''s concerns and requirements,
    user-friendly software was developed for real-time wireless in-field sensing and
    control (WISC). The software was Windows-based custom software and coded as a
    Win32 application using Microsoft Visual C++.Net (ver. 7.1). The WISC software
    was able to read the GPS data through the PLC and send control signals back to
    the PLC for individual sprinkler control after completing a decision making process.
    The algorithm flowchart of the WISC software is shown in Fig. 3. The software
    was updated from version 1.0 (Kim et al., 2006) to integrate the feedback of wireless
    sensor network into the decision making process. The decision support process
    is based on feedback of in-field data every 15 min and GPS updates of the location
    of the machine control cart every second. The actual amount of water applied to
    each plot is calculated based on the cycle ratios, recorded GPS-referenced times
    and locations during the irrigation operation and written to a file for reference.

    for sensor-based site-specific irrigation stations that is updated every 15 min.
    The WISC software consists of four main design factors: control panel for hardware
    interface, graphical monitoring for in-field WSN, irrigation control and monitoring,
    and nozzle sequencing. Each design factor featured self-explanatory, click-and-play
    menu using graphical user interface (GUI) including an optional simulation function.
    The software was further optimized to adapt changes of crop design, irrigation
    pattern, and field location. 3.1. Control panel A control panel dialog was created
    to configure data interface for the irrigation control system. A GPS clock was
    corrected from Greenwich mean time (GMT) to a local time based on a time zone,
    and −6 was added to represent a U.S. Mountain time with daylight saving (Fig.
    4). The GPS offset was set to zero for both x- (east) and y- (north) axes, as
    the GPS was mounted on the middle of a main linear control cart with sprinkler
    nozzles aligned along a longitude line. The status of communication ports for
    the GPS and PLC are automatically detected on the software initiation, and corresponding
    serial port numbers are displayed (Fig. 4). A pushbutton ‘Irrigation Control’
    in Fig. 4 opens a real-time GPS-based irrigation control and monitoring dialog.
    During the irrigation operation, PLC communication connectivity is alerted every
    second after a complete cycle of data processing by a short beep sound, ranging
    from 0 (silent) to 10 (loudest). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Graphical
    display of in-field sensor data received from wireless sensor network. The 15-min
    update rate of the WSN data is based on a computer clock, while 60-s duty cycle
    of irrigation operation is based on a GPS clock. To avoid time mismatch between
    sensor feedback input and irrigation control output data in decision making, it
    is necessary to synchronize a computer clock with a GPS clock and convert to a
    correct local time by clicking a pushbutton of ‘Synch PC clock with GPS’ (Fig.
    4). All data are recorded during the irrigation operation and saved to a file
    named ‘PLC_mmdd.csv’, where ‘PLC’ is a default filename and ‘mm’ and ‘dd’ are
    the current month and day, respectively. Each data string contains actual amount
    of water applied on each plot with GPS data. 3.2. Remote monitoring of WSN A WSN
    dialog was added to provide a graphical display of the sensory data and to integrate
    in-field sensor feedback with an irrigation controller. There were five sensor
    stations numbered from 1 to 5 and a weather station numbered 6. Boxes under ‘Station
    ID’ on a WSN are checked as default to show all six stations and can be unchecked
    to see individual station data (Fig. 4). Time updates at each station are displayed
    next to the station list and used to check the status of radio communication and
    data transmissions. Weekly display of graphs was selected as default and can be
    changed to daily, monthly, or manual selection based on date or day of year (DOY),
    as shown in Fig. 4. 3.3. Real-time control of variable-rate irrigation (VRI) A
    GPS-based irrigation control dialog was created to provide interactive real-time
    control and monitoring of the site-specific irrigation operation. The dialog displays
    a background image of experimental plots and interactive control menu for wireless
    irrigation control. The image shows a base station in the research center on the
    left hand side and experimental plots 700 m away on the right hand side (Fig.
    5). The irrigation plot image can be zoomed by selecting the ‘IN’ or ‘OUT’ button
    on at the top of the plot image. An irrigation map is selected from the ‘OPEN’
    button and displayed over the plot image by clicking the ‘Irrigation Map’ button.
    Fig. 5 shows an example map of 30 sprinkler banks (15 for MESA in blue and 15
    for LEPA in green). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. GPS-based irrigation
    control dialog for real-time wireless irrigation control and monitoring, showing
    the sequence of nozzle-on operation at the bottom: without staggering (left, unstable
    below 50%), with staggering (right, stable all above 50%). The dialog allows selection
    of irrigation plots on crop menu buttons in ‘Crops’ at the top of the plot image.
    Plots to irrigate are selected based on crop types (sugar beet, barley, potato,
    wheat, etc.). Fig. 5 shows a total of 480 subplots (32 × 15) for variable-rate
    irrigation. Each subplot was color coded according to irrigation sprinkler types
    (light blue for MESA and light green for LEPA). User can define an irrigation
    type by clicking each subplot to toggle sprinkler types (MESA 100%, LEPA 100%,
    or 0% no water) and the amount of water application of each subplot from 0 to
    100% with 1% increment by click-and-dragging each slide bar in ‘Nozzle Duty Cycle
    [%]’ on the right hand side of Fig. 5, changing color intensity accordingly (more
    water in darker color). A modified irrigation map can be stored by selecting the
    ‘SAVE’ button to a map file with information of grid, crop locations, sprinkler
    type and percentage water amount on each subplots. The software receives GPS locations
    of the cart from the PLC and sends individual control signals for all sprinkler
    nozzle banks every second automatically on request after processing in-field sensory
    data for decision making. It also allows manual control by disabling ‘Auto Nozzle
    Control’ and selecting each span checkbox in ‘Real-Time Nozzle Control’ at the
    right top corner of Fig. 5. The ‘Toggle MESA/LEPA’ checkbox allows toggling MESA
    and LEPA when selecting either one, which prevents redundant irrigation on the
    same sprinkler banks. The decision rule base for variable-rate irrigation controls
    the amount of water applied by adjusting the duty cycle of each sprinkler bank
    in a period of 60 s. For instance, 50% water application turns the nozzle on for
    30 s and off for 30 s. When the irrigation cart moves across a plot boundary,
    irrigation data are recorded during the irrigation operation to a file containing
    each string name labeled with a local time stamp to the nearest millisecond, plot
    number, GMT time, longitude, latitude, and percentage of water actually applied
    on each plot row. The ‘Simulation’ button offers an option to simulate the variable-rate
    irrigation operation on a selected irrigation map with a slide bar of speed control.
    3.4. Nozzle sequencing for VRI The variable-rate irrigation is implemented by
    controlling nozzle on and off, and thus the sequence of nozzle operations must
    be carefully assigned to avoid system damage from high hydraulic pressure. Based
    on an assumption of 50% of total sprinkler banks as a minimum number of nozzle-on
    banks for safe hydraulic operation, the nozzle operation requires a staggering
    process to distribute the nozzle-on operations evenly during 60-s duty cycle.
    Two histogram at the bottom of Fig. 5 display the status of total nozzle-on operations
    by 15-horizontal timeslot bars whose length indicates nozzle-on watering duration
    out of 60-s full length (100% watering) in two different sprinkler types: MESA
    in blue and LEPA in green. The graph above each histogram illustrates the cumulative
    timeslot status of total nozzle-on banks. The left histogram shows operation without
    staggering in which all 15 sprinkler banks start the nozzle-on operation at the
    beginning of the 60-s cycle and result in an unsafe (upper graph in red line in
    Fig. 5) system after 24 s, because the total number of the nozzle-on banks becomes
    less than the 50% (7 banks) of the entire sprinkler banks (15 banks). The right
    histogram shows the staggered timeslots that were distributed to achieve the total
    number of nozzle-on banks above the 50% all the time across the 60-s cycle. An
    algorithm was developed to implement the staggering process with 15 timeslots
    for each of nozzle bank operations, as shown in Fig. 6. The goal of the staggering
    algorithm is to maintain the total number of nozzle-on banks more than a half
    of the entire sprinkler banks by rearranging nozzle-on timeslots (horizontal bars)
    within 60-s duty cycle. When a time (t) during the 60-s cycle is initialized to
    zero, the timeslots are sorted. Seven longest timeslots are searched and located
    to start at t = 0, while the rest of eight shortest timeslots are located to end
    at t = 60. If the total number of nozzle-on banks becomes less than 7, then an
    unused shortest timeslot is located to start at the time (t0) the previous timeslot
    ends until the total number is summed to 7. As time goes, the duration of the
    seven longest timeslots ends in the order of their timeslot length. On the right
    histogram in Fig. 5, for instance, the bank# 6 ends the nozzle-on duration at
    t = 24 in earliest among the seven longest timeslots (banks# 2, 6, 7, 10, 11,
    13, and 15), which causes the total number of nozzle-on banks to 6 (less than
    50%). In order to bring the number back to 7, the bank# 9 is selected as an unused
    shortest timeslot among the rest of eight shortest timeslots (banks# 1, 3, 4,
    5, 8, 9, 12, and 14) and placed to start at t = 24. This process repeats until
    the time reaches to the end of the cycle at t = 60 and restarts a staggering cycle.

    patterns and different irrigation machines at different locations constrain the
    global use of the irrigation software. To overcome such constraint, this study
    was performed to optimize the irrigation software for the unconstrained use of
    variable-rate application via user-friendly graphical user interface. 4.1. Scalable
    plot design The plot layout (e.g. spacing) of individual irrigation plots can
    be varied over season and must be externally user-defined by irrigation software.
    The WISC software was optimized to adapt the changes of the field layout by making
    boundary lines of subplots adjustable so that each boundary line can be adjusted
    by click-and-drag and referring to a display of GPS location. Each boundary line
    can be landmarked for user reference, and its mark (inverted solid triangle in
    Fig. 5) is toggled on/off by clicking the top of the boundary line. All changes
    of grid and plot layout are included in each irrigation map, when it is saved
    to a map file. 4.2. Re-locatable field design The different irrigation fields
    at different locations changes the field size and irrigation pattern and must
    be adapted by irrigation software. The GPS location of the field is reconfigured
    by selecting the ‘SETUP’ button in Fig. 5, where the latitude and longitude of
    four boundary corners of the field are edited. The button also provides reconfiguration
    of field layout (e.g. size and numbers) of the irrigation plots, where the field
    grid is scalable up to 100 (column) × 50 (row) with maximum 5 sprinkler banks
    per span to adapt different irrigation. All real-world GPS coordinates are converted
    to image coordinates to fit in a screen size and register pixels to a real-world
    coordinates. According to the field geographical layout, the field orientation
    mark (4) is displayed on the left top corner of the irrigation map, and navigation
    information is displayed for distance and time traveled/to travel with a status
    arrow of heading direction at the bottom of the irrigation map in Fig. 5. 4.3.
    Reconfigurable crop design The crops are changed over the season, and the field
    needs to be reconfigured to define which crop is located at where. The ‘DEFINE
    CROP’ button on the top of the irrigation map in Fig. 5 allows a user to redefine
    the type of crop and reassign each individual subplot to a different crop by selecting
    a crop and clicking each subplot to include/exclude, which toggles red-boxed/no-boxed,
    respectively. Once crops are all defined, selecting a crop will include in irrigation
    operation only subplots assigned in the define mode to the crop. 5. Experiment
    and results The WISC software was tested for in-field wireless sensor-based closed-loop
    irrigation control during the 2007 growing season under a linear-move irrigation
    system on a field planted to malting-barley at the Eastern Agricultural Research
    Center of Montana State University in Sidney, MT. Five in-field sensing stations
    were installed at five different soil zones labeled in descending order of soil
    electrical conductivity, while an in-field weather station was mounted on the
    linear irrigation cart. The manually selected travel speed of the linear-move
    sprinkler system determines the maximum application depth. The amount of water
    applied was determined by the deficit of the current soil moisture status from
    the upper limit value of the range of each sensor to apply a percentage of maximum.
    Sensor calibration and decision making process are detailed in Kim et al. (2009).
    The amount of water to apply at each of VRI plots is updated every 15 min by in-field
    soil water feedback from all five soil zones. The soil water status at each sensor
    station represents all rest of area that belongs to the same soil zone and is
    distributed across the VRI plots. Catch cans were installed across a strip that
    contained all five soil zones and aligned between two MESA sprinkler heads (Fig.
    7). The cans catch water only from MESA nozzles, since LEPA nozzles drop water
    below catch cans’ height. Fig. 8 shows catch can data collected on August 16,
    2007 and compared to irrigation amount that was determined by decision making
    process, ranging 0.1–2.5 cm water over the five soil zones. They were correlated
    to the irrigated amount with r2 = 0.98 with average 0.08 cm of more catch can
    water under the wind drift of average 10 km/h at 18° wind direction. Download

    irrigation system requires a seamless integration of in-field wireless sensor
    network and closed-loop control of sprinkler nozzles and must be easily used and
    simply managed by end-users (growers) via user-friendly software. A real-time
    wireless in-field sensing and control software was developed to integrate a site-specific
    irrigation controller with in-field data feedback and support the decision making
    and real-time monitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio
    communication. This paper provided to readers details of software design choices
    with design factors and optimizations for unconstrained global use. Each design
    factor featured self-explanatory, click-and-play menu using graphical user interface
    including an optional simulation function. An algorithm for nozzle sequencing
    was developed to minimize hydraulic pressure surges by staggering and uniformly
    distributing the nozzle-on timeslots during 60-s duty cycle. The system successfully
    enabled real-time remote access to the field conditions and feedback control for
    site-specific irrigation with high correlation of r2 = 0.98 to water collected
    by catch cans. The benefit of software design extends to adapt automated site-specific
    fertilizer or chemical applications. References Abreu and Pereira, 2002 Abreu,

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353  \n21 of 29 \ncontinuous assessment of crop stress and growth stage\
    \ throughout the growing season. This will be \ninstrumental in avoiding temporary\
    \ severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop \nyield or\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\
    \ rate water application systems is presently a \nconstraint to the wide-scale\
    \ adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield \nimprovements\
    \ and water savings currently achieved through field-scale precision irrigation\
    \ may not \njustify the initial capital investment required for its adoption.\
    \ As fresh water resources become \nscarcer, it is expected that more premium\
    \ will be placed on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture. \nRegulatory agencies\
    \ may also require farmers to continuously demonstrate the efficient use of water.\
    \ \nThese factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers\
    \ [155]. \nA conceptual model-based decision support system that uses the full\
    \ range of plant, weather \nand soil data for irrigation management is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1. This is currently being developed \nby the authors. It involves\
    \ the integration of various sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine \nlearning\
    \ and model predictive control into an adaptive decision support system for precision\
    \ \nirrigation.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Conceptual model-based decision support system\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    \ turned into proﬁtable decisions only when eﬃciently\nmanaged. Current advances\
    \ in data management are making Smart Farming grow exponentially\nas data have\
    \ become the key element in modern agriculture to help producers with critical\n\
    decision-making. Valuable advantages appear with objective information acquired\
    \ through sensors\nwith the aim of maximizing productivity and sustainability.\
    \ This kind of data-based managed farms\nrely on data that can increase eﬃciency\
    \ by avoiding the misuse of resources and the pollution of\nthe environment. Data-driven\
    \ agriculture, with the help of robotic solutions incorporating artiﬁcial\nintelligent\
    \ techniques, sets the grounds for the sustainable agriculture of the future.\
    \ This paper\nreviews the current status of advanced farm management systems by\
    \ revisiting each crucial step,\nfrom data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to variable\
    \ rate applications, so that growers can make optimized\ndecisions to save money\
    \ while protecting the environment and transforming how food will be\nproduced\
    \ to sustainably match the forthcoming population growth.\nKeywords: agriculture\
    \ 4.0; big data; farm management information system (FMIS); robotics; IoT;\nvariable-rate\
    \ technology (VRT); AI\n1. Introduction\nThe agriculture sector is undergoing\
    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207; doi:10.3390/agronomy10020207\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\
    \ This robot is autonomously driven when monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local \nperception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and ultrasound sensors)\
    \ for navigation and safeguarding. It \ngathers data from the canopy of the vines\
    \ with the goal of creating plant water status maps and \nnutritional status maps.\
    \ In order to accomplish its mission in a reasonable timeframe, established by\
    \ \nend-users at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors vine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies \nseveral challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust sensors\

    \ \nFigure 2. Version II (2019) of VineScout autonomous robot: Front (a) and rear\
    \ (b).\n3.3. Stage III: Data\nOne of the fundamental diﬀerences between traditional\
    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\
    \ water status maps, about fertilization and diﬀerential harvesting.\nAgronomy\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\

    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\

    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\

    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\

    \ T: Technology); 2 PaaS: Platform as a service.\nThe use of commercial data management\
    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ some action on the crop or\nrelated to it, and this can be done by making decisions\
    \ right after obtaining information (real-time\napplications) or in another moment\
    \ deferred in time (oﬀ-line). For farmers to execute decisions,\nthey need advanced\
    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction There are many techniques
    available for the precision agriculture to monitor and control, environment for
    the growth of many crops. Due to unequal distribution of rain water, it is very
    difficult to requirement needed farmer to manage the water equally to all the
    crops in whole farm it requires some irrigation method that suitable for any weather
    condition, soil types and variety of crops. Irrigation management is a important
    factor in agriculture allows the farmer to improve the cultivation in a way the
    plants need. According to the requirement of the crops the threshold will be set,
    if the any environmental condition like temperature, soil conditions and humidity
    goes below or above the threshold value, then IOT sense the changing in parameters
    are monitored simultaneously and all the data will be transmitted to farmers,
    according to that farmer will take the controlling decision and send to the system.
    The system will run the actuator and control the parameter. Types of sensor used
    and controlling action that are taken according to them Temperature control -
    Growth of plantation depends on photosynthesis methods that is depends upon the
    radiation from the sun. Humidity control -Water vapour is main problem that''s
    affecting the growth of crops. Because of high humidity, chances of disease are
    increasing. Soil control- Soil water also affects the crop growth. Therefore,
    the monitor & control of soil condition have a specific interest, because the
    good condition of a soil provides the proper yield. The Proposal of the project
    is to develop a smart irrigation monitoring system using Arduino. Focus area will
    be parameters such as temperature and soil moisture. SECTION II. Objective The
    main objective of our project is to work for Farming where various new technologies
    to yield higher growth of the crops and their water supply. We are going to check
    the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The paper is all about automated
    control features with latest electronic technology using microcontroller which
    turns the pumping motor ON and OFF on detecting the dampness content of the earth
    and GSM phone line. It works automatically and hence reduces the man power. Irrigation
    is the artificial application of water to the land or soil. It is used to assist
    in growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation
    of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Watering
    systems will reduce the burden of getting water to plants when they need it. Knowing
    when and how much to water is two important aspects of watering process. To make
    the gardener works easily, the automatic plant watering system is created. SECTION
    III. Existing System Now days, water shortage is one of the biggest problem in
    the world. Many different methods are developed for conservation of water. We
    need water in each and every field. Water is considered to be basic need of all
    living creatures. Agriculture is one of the fields where water is required in
    massive quantity. Major problem in agriculture is every time excess of water is
    given to the fields. Many techniques are used to save or to control wastage of
    water from agriculture like Ditch Irrigation, Terraced Irrigation, Sprinkler System
    Rotary Systems. An automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support System, SIDSS,
    is determined to manage irrigation in agriculture. System estimates the weekly
    irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil evaluation and climatic
    variables convoked by several autonomous nodes deployed infield. This enables
    a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system to local perturbations
    and evaluation errors. Two machine learning approach, PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed
    as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. This approach is validated on three commercial
    plantations of citrus trees located in Spain. Performance is evaluated against
    decisions taken by a human expert. The main characteristic of system is the use
    of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to precisely
    predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works that are
    based only on weather variables or doesn''t indicate the amount of water required
    by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil specification in
    a closed loop control scheme allows to get used to the decision support system
    to local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive
    weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS
    has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system
    is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision
    support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been
    proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain
    the best performance. Limitations in the Existing System The Existing irrigation
    system does not make the efficient use of water. Water is not fed to the plant
    whenever there is need it leads to water scarcity. Quantity of water is not defined
    for each water supply in irrigation system. SECTION IV. Proposed System The Proposal
    of the project is to develop a smart irrigation monitoring system using Arduino.
    Focus area will be parameters such as temperature and soil moisture. This system
    will be a substitute to classical farming method. We will develop such a system
    that will help a farmer to know his field status in his home or he may be residing
    in any part of the world. It proposes an automatic irrigation system for the agricultural
    lands. Currently the automation is one of the important role in the human life.
    It not only provides comfort but also reduce energy, efficiency and time saving.
    Now the industries are using automation and control machine which is high in cost
    and not suitable for using in a farm field. So here it also designs a smart irrigation
    technology in low cost which is usable by Indian farmers. Arduino is the main
    heart of the whole system. An automated irrigation system was developed to optimize
    water use for agricultural crops. Automation allows us to control appliances automatically.
    The objectives of this paper were to control the water motor automatically and
    we can also watch live streaming of farm on android mobiles by using wi-fi. Advantages
    of the Proposed System The proposed system provides real time information on the
    field irrigation. Here the water is supplied based on the actual needs for the
    crops. This automated irrigation system is cost reduction and resource optimization.
    It improves the environment quality and increases the irrigation. It also reduces
    water logging and water shortages. SECTION V. System Architecture This archetype
    monitors the amount of soil humidity and temperature. A predetermine range of
    soil moisture and temperature is set, and can be varied with soil type or crop
    type. In case the moisture or temperature of the soil diverges from the specified
    range, the watering system is turned on/off. In case of dry soil and high soil
    temperature, it will activate the irrigation system, pumping water for watering
    the plants. Figure 1. System architecture Show All The block diagram of smart
    irrigation system is characterized in Fig1. It consists of a microcontroller (ATmega328)
    which is the brain of the system. Both the moisture and temperature sensors are
    combined to the input pins of the controller. The water pump and the servo motor
    are coupled with the output pins. If the sensors depart from the per-ordinated
    range, the controller turns on pump. The servo motor is used to control the angular
    point of the pipe, which ensures equal diffusion of water to the soil. To reduce
    the amount of field work for the farmer this operation also offers wireless switching
    on-off of pumps for watering, irrigating. Wireless sensor network of soil moisture
    sensor, soil pH sensor and soil temperature sensor is connected to an Arduino
    Mega 2560 micro controller board. The android application controls the pumps over
    GSM network via SMS (which enables pump control over long distances) and Blue-tooth
    (when in close proximity for real time diagnosis of the sensor readings). This
    system can be implemented on a large scale for farming purposes, which can further
    prove to be more beneficial. Owing to prevailing conditions and water shortages,
    the optimum irrigation schedules should be determined especially in farms to conserve
    water. SECTION VI. System Performance and Evaluation This project is implemented
    using Arduino ATmega328. Sensors are connected to Arduino using jumping cables.
    The entire system is observed and controlled by power full credit card sized microcontroller
    Arduino. Basic DC motor are used for automatic water supply. Figure 2. System

    All Here the Sensor values are evaluated and displayed in system monitor using
    Arduino OS. The motor automatically will be OFF based on readings. SECTION VII.
    Conclusion In the present the farmers use irrigation approach through the manual
    control, in which the farmers irrigate the land at regular intervals. This process
    seems to consume more water and results in water wastage. Moreover, in dry areas
    where there is inadequate rainfall, irrigation becomes difficult. Hence, we require
    an automatic system that will precisely monitor and control the water essential
    in the field. Installing Smart irrigation system saves time and ensures judicious
    usage of water. Moreover, this architecture uses micro-controller which promises
    an increase in system life by reducing power consumption. The entire system is
    monitored and controlled by the power full credit card sized micro-controller
    Arduino. It provides with several benefits and can achieve with less manpower.
    The system provides water only when the humidity in the soil goes below the reference.
    Due to the direct transfer of water to the roots water management takes place
    and also helps to maintain the moisture to soil ratio at the root zone consistent
    to some extent. Thus, the system is efficient and compatible to changing environment.
    Our Future work involves, a water meter installed to estimate the amount of water
    used for irrigation and thus giving a cost estimation. A valve can be used for
    varying the volume of water flow. Furthermore, Wireless sensors can also be used.

    1. Introduction\nThe concept of “precision agriculture” is used to deﬁne technologies\
    \ that support customized\nagricultural practices aimed at higher eﬃciency and\
    \ a lower impact on the environment [1]. Greenhouse\nproduction systems decrease\
    \ crop water requirements by as much as 20% to 40% compared to open\nﬁeld cultivation;\
    \ however, growers routinely apply more irrigation water than the estimated water\n\
    consumption [2–4]. Irrigation practices are generally based on the personal perspective\
    \ of the grower;\ni.e., irrigation without monitoring the soil or plant water\
    \ status [5]. Considering the number of diﬀerent\nplant species grown in prevailing\
    \ greenhouse environments, the types of substrate and container sizes,\nﬁeld and\
    \ soil characteristics, and the diﬀerent irrigation systems, it becomes obvious\
    \ why irrigation\nscheduling becomes complex if it is to be achieved with any\
    \ level of precision [6–8]. Therefore, an\naccurate short term estimation of crop\
    \ water requirements in protected cultivation are a prerequisite\nfor optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling; as evapotranspiration (ETC) could occur so rapidly that\
    \ water loss\ncan cause plant damage before wilting symptoms become visible [9,10].\
    \ Irrigation management is\ntypically expected to achieve maximum water supply\
    \ for plant growth and production, with soil or\nsubstrate water content being\
    \ maintained close to ﬁeld capacity [11].\nEven in soilless cultivation systems,\
    \ irrigation represents a very large and potentially important\nloss of nutrients\
    \ and a source of environmental pollution (i.e., drain to waste hydroponics systems)\
    \ as a\nHorticulturae 2019, 5, 7; doi:10.3390/horticulturae5010007\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2019, 5, 7\n2 of 20\nsurplus of 20% to 50% of the plant’s water\
    \ uptake in each irrigation cycle is often recommended [12–16].\nIndeed, annual\
    \ use of irrigation water ranges from 150 to 200 mm (e.g., leafy vegetable) in\
    \ soil-based\ngreenhouse crops to 1000 to 1500 mm in soilless-grown (e.g., Solanaceae,\
    \ cucurbits) [11]. For container\nnursery production, as cited by Fulcher et al.\
    \ [17], those values could be as high as 2900 mm.\nConsidering the scarcity of\
    \ water resources combined with the operational energy irrigation costs,\nmaintaining\
    \ the sustainable use of water is a major water-climate policy challenge since\
    \ excessive\nirrigation results in low water use eﬃciency, increases in runoﬀ\
    \ and contributes to higher CO2\nemissions [18–20]. Several institutions have\
    \ worked to improve water use in irrigation, developed\nvarious models of water\
    \ eﬃciency, reducing the environmental problems associated with irrigation in\n\
    order to mitigate severe structural water deﬁcits, yet these models are not commercialized\
    \ [4,21].\nThis paper presents a review of the literature dealing with irrigation\
    \ of greenhouse crops. The\nnecessity, the advantages and the limitations of each\
    \ irrigation approach used are discussed in relation\nto diﬀerent greenhouse types\
    \ and the ability of an irrigation controller unit to support a feedback\nirrigation\
    \ decision system.\n2. Background\nThe exact time and volume of irrigation are\
    \ probably the most important factors for eﬃcient\nirrigation management and saving\
    \ water, and these in turn also improve the productivity and quality\nof crops\
    \ grown in the greenhouse [22,23]. This is especially true as the high potential\
    \ eﬃciency\nof fertigation (i.e., irrigation combined with fertilization) has\
    \ become a routine cultural practice,\ntherefore the terms “irrigation” and “fertigation”\
    \ are often used interchangeably [24–27]. Yet, irrigation\nmanagement of substrate-based\
    \ greenhouse crops still requires much more accurate control than for\nthe same\
    \ crop grown in soil, taking into account that substrates have very little nutrient\
    \ buﬀering\ncapacity [28].\nSoilless growth systems in readily made artiﬁcial\
    \ media commonly use organic (i.e., coconut coir,\npeat moss, pine bark) or inert\
    \ substrates (i.e., perlite, rockwool, vermiculite); with substrate volume at\n\
    approximately 10 to 40 L m−2 as is the case of rockwool or perlite slabs [29,30].\
    \ Horticultural production\nhas historically been increasingly based on those\
    \ ready-made substrates produced on an industrial\nscale with unique characteristics\
    \ such as a limited cation exchange and low buﬀering capacity, good\nwater permeability\
    \ and adequate aeration [31]. Compared to soil cultivation systems, soilless growth\n\
    systems are superior for plant growth as less energy is required by plants to\
    \ extract water at ﬁeld\ncapacity, therefore experiencing a lower risk of oxygen\
    \ deﬁciency [32,33]. In the same manner, all\ncontainerized production systems\
    \ can be considered as hydroponic (i.e., soilless growth system) since\nthey consist\
    \ of an artiﬁcial root zone aimed at optimizing water and nutrient availability\
    \ [34]. However,\nthe restricted root volume may negatively aﬀect the supply of\
    \ nutrients to the plants as the water in\nthe substrate may be rapidly decreased\
    \ [32,35–37]. In addition, changes are induced in air and water\nretention characteristics\
    \ of organic and inorganic substrates when they are used for longer periods\n\
    than one growing season [38,39]. Therefore, according to Deepagoda et al. [29],\
    \ a porous media should\npreferably be inert to prevent chemical and biological\
    \ interactions.\nIrrespective of the type of greenhouse cultivation system used\
    \ (i.e., soil or soilless), irrigation\nscheduling should be managed (I) to supply\
    \ plants with the volume of water equal to the volume of\ntranspired water for\
    \ maintaining crop productivity, (II) to overcome the diﬀerences in water discharge\n\
    achieving high water uniformity (III) to move excessive salts towards the rooting\
    \ system, avoiding\nsoil salination [30,40]. Even in the latter case, for greenhouse\
    \ cultivation systems there is always a\nrisk of erroneous choices in the matching\
    \ irrigation supply to crop evapotranspiration, as it may be\naﬀected by sudden\
    \ changes in outside weather conditions or the use of climate control systems\
    \ such\nas heating and ventilation [41]. That is another reason why for open hydroponic\
    \ systems the main\nirrigation strategy is to supply nutrient solutions, with\
    \ a surplus of 30% to 50% of the water uptake by\nthe plants [14].\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2019, 5, 7\n3 of 20\nThe leaching requirement in greenhouse soil-grown cultivation\
    \ can be estimated based on\nirrigation water salinity and crop salt tolerance\
    \ following FAO [42] as below:\nLR =\nECiw\n5ECe − ECiw\n,\n(1)\nwhere LR is the\
    \ minimum leaching requirement needed to control salts within the tolerance ECe\
    \ of the\ncrop; ECiw is the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water applied\
    \ (dS m−1); and, ECe the average\nsoil salinity tolerated by the crop as measured\
    \ on a soil saturation extract (dS m−1).\nHowever, as cited by Ben-Gal et al.\
    \ [43], traditional guidelines for the calculation of the crop-speciﬁc\nleaching\
    \ requirement is imprecise due to failure to consider soil type, climate, or salinity-induced\n\
    reduction in plant transpiration. Such omissions could possibly result in underestimating\
    \ actual\nleaching and over-estimation of leaching requirements.\nMicro-irrigation\
    \ is often promoted as a technology that can increase the application eﬃciency\n\
    of water, and improve crop production and quality. The sub irrigation system also\
    \ applies for the\nproduction of many ornamental hydroponic crops. However, the\
    \ tendency for salts to build up in\nthe upper portion of the root zone represents\
    \ a drawback [44,45]. Harmanto et al. [46] working with\nsoil-based greenhouse\
    \ tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) in a tropical environment indicated that by\n\
    applying drip irrigation, the water savings inside the greenhouse could be as\
    \ much as 20% to 25%\nhigher compared to an open ﬁeld drip irrigated farming system.\n\
    For scheduling irrigation in soil or soilless greenhouses, it is essential to\

    \ the irrigation dose. In addition, as cited\nin Incrocci et al. [16], the irrigation\
    \ dose of container growing medium could be estimated based on\nwater potential\
    \ or volumetric water content, with the use of soil moisture sensors. In the meantime,\n\
    the adoption of soil moisture monitoring in vegetables has been restricted by\
    \ means of sensor accuracy\nand price as well as labor required for installation,\
    \ removal, and collection of readings [7]. A recent\nreview by Bianchi et al.\
    \ [47] summarized the four macro-groups of soil water potential devices and\n\
    their operational characteristics.\nAccording to Cahn and Johnson [7], an advantage\
    \ of tension thresholds is the lesser inﬂuence by\nsoil texture in comparison\
    \ to volumetric moisture thresholds. Even so, as cited by Nikolaou et al. [48],\n\
    sensors that estimate dielectric capacitance or dielectric permittivity of substrates\
    \ (e.g., time domain\nreﬂectometry, frequency domain) have a propensity to be\
    \ more reliable for soilless culture systems, as\nopposed to sensors measuring\
    \ water availability through the matric potential such as the tensiometers.\n\
    According to Baille [49], in the short-term, decision level irrigation can be\
    \ triggered based either\non greenhouse microclimate or on soil/substrate moisture\
    \ status. Irrigation scheduling based on direct\nor indirect measurement of plant\
    \ water status and plant physiological responses to drought by using\nplant-based\

    \ Monitoring Irrigation in Greenhouse Crops\nIrrigation scheduling may have an\
    \ impact on crop water productivity, aﬀecting fruit yield and\nquality as well\
    \ [76–78]. However, the targeted performance of a crop is largely situational;\
    \ as irrigation\nmight also be used as a tool for increasing water use eﬃciency,\
    \ for maximizing yield or economic\nreturn [79].\nFor soil-based greenhouse cucumber\
    \ (Cucumis sativus), Alomran [77] indicated that applying\ndeﬁcit irrigation at\
    \ speciﬁc crop stages with 80% ETC (i.e., decrease irrigation water up to 40%\
    \ ETC) is\nthe most appropriate irrigation strategy for high crop water productivity\
    \ and yield. For greenhouse\ntomatoes, partial root drying resulted in a water\
    \ savings of 50%, but negatively aﬀected the total fruit\nand total dry mass.\
    \ However, the considerable savings of water could make partial root drying feasible\n\
    in areas where water is scarce and expensive [80].\nFor soilless greenhouse cucumber,\
    \ between transplanting and ﬂowering, irrigation should be\nscheduled so as to\
    \ induce slight water stress and increase root growth, while tomatoes should be\n\
    stressed for a longer period (i.e., about three weeks) in order to set the ﬁrst\
    \ and second trusses [81].\nIn addition, several authors [53,60,82–84] indicated\
    \ that increasing the irrigation intervals in soilless\nculture with the same\
    \ daily amount of water applied positively inﬂuenced crop growth and production\n\
    and minimized the outﬂow of water and nutrients from the greenhouse into the environment.\
    \ However,\nthat is not always the case, because results are often crop and substrate\
    \ speciﬁc, and are also dependent\non the experimental conditions and the limiting\
    \ growth factor(s) [85].\nA more rational approach for optimizing irrigation is\
    \ through automatic irrigation controllers.\nTherefore, irrigation management\
    \ approaches may be categorized according to the ability of a controller\nunit\
    \ to support a feedback system [86]. Irrigation operations are often automated\
    \ by using timers,\nspecialized controllers, or computer control [87]. In the\
    \ simplest form of automation in an “open loop\nirrigation control system”, no\
    \ measurements of the system outputs are used to modify the inputs\nand irrigation\
    \ is based on preset time intervals (i.e., time clock scheduling) [86,88,89].\
    \ In a “feedback\nbased irrigation closed-loop control system”, the system provides\
    \ growers with output data in real\ntime (i.e., percentage of drainage, plant\
    \ water status) which are evaluated in order to reschedule or\nperform irrigation.\
    \ In a “feed forward irrigation control system” water uptake is predicted by using\n\
    growth and transpiration models [14,71]. In addition, computerized-controlled\
    \ irrigation systems\ncan utilize a range of data to achieve accurate delivery\
    \ of water according to crop requirements [71].\nThese systems are often mentioned\
    \ as a fuzzy-logic control system, artiﬁcial intelligent system or\nmulticriterion\
    \ decision-making system. They are gaining importance because of their inherent\
    \ ability\nto judge alternative scenarios for the selection of the best alternative\
    \ which may be further analyzed\nbefore implementation [90].\n2.2. The Soil/Substrate\
    \ Physical Properties and the Irrigation Dose\nEvapotranspiration rates depend\
    \ on greenhouse environmental conditions, and are also aﬀected\nby the water supply\
    \ to the roots [91]. For scheduling irrigation, hydraulic properties and water\
    \ content\ndependence on substrate suction must be known as they inﬂuence the\
    \ water movement and retention\nin the substrate [91–93]. Water retention curves\
    \ or moisture characteristic curves relate the water\ncontent in a speciﬁc substrate\
    \ to the matric potential at a given tension or height [94]. Diﬀerent kinds\n\
    of substrates, as Fields et al. [95] indicated, have diﬀerent water retention\
    \ curves (Figure 1).\nHorticulturae 2019, 5, 7\n6 of 20\nHorticulturae 2019, 5,\

    \ \nFrom Figure 1, we can observe that the easily available water content (i.e.,\
    \ water released \nbetween 1 and 5 kPa) in coir is higher in comparison to pine\
    \ bark; therefore, the crop may absorb \nmore available water, reducing the need\
    \ for applying a high frequency irrigation program. In \naddition, a taller container\
    \ proportionately holds less water, as a percentage of water content by \nvolume.\
    \ Irrigation should take into account indices related to substrate availability\
    \ of water, to \ncontainer geometry and to specific substrate characteristics\
    \ [64]. In general, water held by tensions \nhigher than 10 kPa are considered\
    \ unavailable to the crop, and water held between 5 to 10 kPa \ntensions are referred\

    \ that is available in a specific substrate as obtained from the water release\

    \ plants depends on the \nactual moisture flux from the medium to the plant roots\
    \ rather than on the water volume in the \ncontainer. By measuring water contents\
    \ at different pressure heads, the soil water retention function \ncan be determined.\
    \ However, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurement is often difficult\
    \ \nas it may require expensive equipment [91,94,98]. The reason is because substrates\
    \ containing \npredominantly organic components decompose during crop production\
    \ cycles resulted in changes \nin air to water ratios. Additionally, shrinkage\
    \ and compaction of substrates generates problems with \nwatering, hydration,\
    \ and generally leads to worsening the air to water relationship [99,100]. In\
    \ the \nsame way, hydraulic conductivity of rockwool and similar substrates is\
    \ high when well-watered, \nbut declines drastically as it dries out and plants\
    \ experience a water deficit [101]. \nMavrogianopoulos [65] proposed a simple\

    \ of the water holding capacity that is easily available water (%); N \nFigure\
    \ 1. Moisture retention curves of peat, coconut coir and aged pine bark substrate\
    \ components.\nData adapted from [95].\nFrom Figure 1, we can observe that the\
    \ easily available water content (i.e., water released between\n1 and 5 kPa) in\
    \ coir is higher in comparison to pine bark; therefore, the crop may absorb more\
    \ available\nwater, reducing the need for applying a high frequency irrigation\
    \ program. In addition, a taller\ncontainer proportionately holds less water,\
    \ as a percentage of water content by volume. Irrigation\nshould take into account\
    \ indices related to substrate availability of water, to container geometry and\n\
    to speciﬁc substrate characteristics [64]. In general, water held by tensions\
    \ higher than 10 kPa are\nconsidered unavailable to the crop, and water held between\
    \ 5 to 10 kPa tensions are referred to as the\nsubstrate water buﬀer capacity.\
    \ The available water in the container can be estimated according to\nBaudoin\
    \ as follows [96]:\nAWcont. = +0.64AW + 0.30P − 67h + 4.1,\n(2)\nwhere AW is the\
    \ water that is available in a speciﬁc substrate as obtained from the water release\
    \ curve\n(%); P represents the substrate porosity; h is the height of the container\
    \ (m).\nHowever, according to Raviv [97], water and nutrient availability to plants\
    \ depends on the actual\nmoisture ﬂux from the medium to the plant roots rather\
    \ than on the water volume in the container.\nBy measuring water contents at diﬀerent\
    \ pressure heads, the soil water retention function can be\ndetermined. However,\
    \ the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurement is often diﬃcult as it may\n\
    require expensive equipment [91,94,98]. The reason is because substrates containing\
    \ predominantly\norganic components decompose during crop production cycles resulted\
    \ in changes in air to water ratios.\nAdditionally, shrinkage and compaction of\
    \ substrates generates problems with watering, hydration,\nand generally leads\
    \ to worsening the air to water relationship [99,100]. In the same way, hydraulic\n\
    conductivity of rockwool and similar substrates is high when well-watered, but\
    \ declines drastically as\nit dries out and plants experience a water deﬁcit [101].\n\
    Mavrogianopoulos [65] proposed a simple equation for the estimation of the irrigation\
    \ dose based\non substrate characteristics as below:\nQ = Y × WW × N\n(1 − dr)\n\
    ,\n(3)\nwhere Q is the irrigation dose (L slab−1); Y is the water holding capacity\
    \ of the substrate inside the\nslab (L slab−1); Ww is the percentage of the water\
    \ holding capacity that is easily available water (%); N\nHorticulturae 2019,\
    \ 5, 7\n7 of 20\nrepresents a critical percentage of the easily available water\
    \ that when reached, irrigation should start\n(i.e., typical values between 5%\
    \ to 35%); dr is the percentage of drainage (%).\nAccording to the same author,\
    \ the substrate water holding capacity could be estimated by weighing\nit when\
    \ dry, then ﬁlling it up with water for up to 24 h to complete the wetting process,\
    \ draining up to\n12 h, and reweighing it. The diﬀerence in weight is the water\
    \ holding capacity, in kg slab−1 or L slab−1;\nhowever, this procedure should\
    \ be repeated at diﬀerent stages throughout plant growth.\nIn addition, another\
    \ equation for estimating the irrigation dose was proposed by Katsoulas [82],\n\
    taking into account the crop transpiration rate plus an extra amount of water\
    \ for leaching purposes.\nThis method simply reﬂects the substrate inﬂuence on\
    \ crop water uptake, but requires frequent\nmeasurements of crop’s transpiration\
    \ rates.\nE =\nTr\n(1 − D),\n(4)\nTr = ζRGo,\n(5)\nζ = Kcτα\nλ\n,\n(6)\nwhere\
    \ E is the amount of water applied in (Kg m−2); Tr is the crop transpiration (kg\
    \ m−2); Kc is the\nspecies-speciﬁc crop coeﬃcient; τ is the greenhouse radiation\
    \ transmission coeﬃcient; RGo is the solar\nradiation measured outside the greenhouse\
    \ (Kj m−2); a is the evaporation coeﬃcient; λ is the latent heat\nof vapourization\
    \ of water (kJ kg−1); and D is the drainage rate equal to 50% of irrigation water\
    \ apply.\nFor greenhouse soil-based cultivation the amount of water which is “available”\
    \ for root water\nuptake is deﬁned as the amount of soil water between ﬁeld capacity\
    \ (i.e., soil matric pressure −10 or\n−33 kPa) and the permanent wilting point\
    \ (i.e., −1500 kPa) expressed in m of water per m of soil depth.\nHowever, besides\
    \ its use in irrigation management, ﬁeld capacity is not an adequate soil physical\n\
    quantity to assess soil water availability to crops, as a considerable (10% to\
    \ 50%) fraction of transpired\nwater is acquired from the soil at water contents\
    \ above ﬁeld capacity [102].\nThe most common values for typical soil texture\
    \ classes are cited by Snider [103] in Table 2.\nTable 2. Average values of available\
    \ water holding capacity of the main soil texture groups (cm of\nwater per cm\

    \ available soil moisture within the rooting zone has attained a predeﬁned level\
    \ of\navailable water (i.e., the management allowable deﬁcit—MAD), irrigation\
    \ is triggered. The estimation\nof MAD is diﬃcult because it depends on plant\
    \ species and the evaporative conditions [104]. In general,\nthe MAD can be calculated\
    \ as a percentage of the available water, usually 30% to 50% in soil and 10%\n\
    in soilless cropping systems. Then, the irrigation dose can be calculated by multiplying\
    \ the MAD\nwith a coeﬃcient with typical values from 1.15 to 2, to account for\
    \ water application uniformity and\nsalinity. Typically, the frequency of irrigation\
    \ can be estimated when the accumulated daily ETC for\nthe periods between irrigations\
    \ approaches the MAD [96]. In line with this, the irrigation frequency\nof greenhouse\
    \ soil cultivations can be estimated by dividing the readily available water with\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration [68].\nHorticulturae 2019, 5, 7\n8 of 20\nZeng et al.\
    \ [23], working with drip-irrigated greenhouse soil cultivation of muskmelon,\
    \ deﬁned\nthe irrigation dose by measuring the soil water content daily. When\

    \ − DW\nDW\n× 100,\n(8)\nwhere Ir represents the water amount by the drip irrigation\
    \ system (mm); γ (gamma) is the soil bulk\ndensity (1.36 g·cm−3); h is the depth\
    \ of the soil which is irrigated in accordance with the vegetative\nstage; θfc\
    \ is the water ﬁeld capacity (32.9%); g1 is the irrigation application rate (%);\
    \ g2 is the irrigation\nstart point (60%); IE is the irrigation eﬃciency; SWC\
    \ is the soil water content (%); FW is the fresh\nweight; and, DW is the dry weight.\n\
    3. Open and Feed Forward Irrigation Control System\n3.1. Time Clock Scheduling\
    \ and the Accumulated Radiation Method\nIn greenhouses with no feedback system\
    \ control (i.e., open loop system), irrigation scheduling is\ndetermined according\
    \ to the grower’s perspective. Usually growers use a standard irrigation dose\
    \ and\nchange the frequency of irrigation; thus, they automate irrigation only\
    \ on the basis of time [8,88]. For\nsoil-based greenhouse crops the irrigation\
    \ frequency is usually on a daily basis under warm and sunny\nconditions, and\
    \ every 3–4 days under cooler and cloudy conditions [28]. In soilless systems,\
    \ irrigation\nusually starts one hour after sunrise and stops one hour before\
    \ sunset, with hourly or even shorter\nirrigation intervals during a day under\
    \ high radiation conditions. For some substrates (i.e., rockwool)\nnight irrigation\
    \ is also recommended, avoiding drying to account for crop transpiration [105,106].\
    \ In\nline with this, according to Schröder and Lieth [81], irrigation at night\
    \ is advised if the moisture content\nof the substrate has fallen below 8% to\
    \ 10% from the previous morning. However, those rules-of-thumb\nobviously do not\
    \ apply when the weather conditions are changing quickly from day to day [52,107].\n\
    Lizarraga et al. [52] evaluated the eﬃciency of timed scheduling, and concluded\
    \ that this method does\nnot actually meet the irrigation requirements of hydroponic\
    \ tomatoes resulting in over and under\nirrigation during the morning and in the\
    \ afternoon, respectively. Similarly, Incrocci et al. [16], working\nwith several\
    \ species of ornamentals in container nursery crops, reported an increase of the\
    \ water use\nwith timed irrigation scheduling by 20% to 40% and nutrient emissions\
    \ of 39% to 74% in comparison\nwith model-based irrigation.\nA more rational approach\
    \ for irrigation scheduling is the accumulated radiation method, allowing\nmore\
    \ closely matched water supply to the ET rate, which is primarily a day time phenomenon\n\
    depending strongly on solar radiation [14,69,89,108,109]. However, Shin et al.\
    \ [110] indicated that the\ntranspiration rate of soilless paprika (Capsicum annuum)\
    \ plants did not proportionally increase with an\nincrease in light intensity,\
    \ especially in high light conditions.\nFor estimating how much energy the crop\
    \ has received, a light sensor (e.g., pyranometer) is used\nto measure incident\
    \ solar radiation. Once this has been intercepted, a threshold value of light\
    \ energy,\nan irrigation event, is triggered. Schröder and Lieth [81] suggested\
    \ light sums inside greenhouses\nbetween 0.4 and 0.6 MJ m−2 in closed and 1.4\
    \ and 1.8 MJ m−2 in open hydroponic cultures with\ndrainage volume factors of\
    \ 30% and 15%, respectively. However, for rockwool substrate in a free\ndrainage\
    \ system, Lee [111] recommended accumulated values of 0.8 MJ m−2 with a minimum\
    \ rest\ntime set (i.e., not irrigated if the target value is reached) between\
    \ 20 min in bright and 50 min on dark\ndays according to the crop growth phase.\
    \ Additionally, for bell pepper in container growth with peat\nmix, perlite, and\
    \ pine bark media, Jovicich et al. [61] indicated that the ﬁrst-quality fruit\
    \ weight was\nenhanced at solar radiation integral levels of 0.34 MJ m−2, while\
    \ Lizarraga et al. [52] proposed indoor\nvalues of 0.81 MJ m−2 for tomatoes grown\
    \ in perlite in bags of 40 L. In addition, Nikolaou et al. [60],\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2019, 5, 7\n9 of 20\nworking with cucumber in rockwool, indicated a 9% lower\
    \ drainage amount between high and low\nirrigation frequency treatments (i.e.,\
    \ accumulated radiation outside greenhouse 1.3 MJ m−2 as opposed\nto 3 MJ m−2),\
    \ with no negative impact on production.\nDespite the fact that the frequency\
    \ of irrigation can be calculated based on the accumulated\nradiation method,\
    \ the threshold values of light energy requires frequent evaluation, as aﬀected\
    \ by\nchanges of crop coeﬃcient values and cultivation techniques (e.g., defoliation).\
    \ In any case, the solar\nradiation method was used only in soilless systems.\n\
    3.2. Crop Evapotranspiration and the Water Balance Method\nCrop evapotranspiration\
    \ assessment is necessary to correctly quantify crop irrigation water\nneeds,\
    \ playing a crucial role in cooling greenhouse crop canopies [112]. In order to\
    \ evaluate crop\nevapotranspiration (ETC), environmental conditions and physical,\
    \ morphological and physiological\nfeatures of soil-plant systems have to be considered\
    \ [113].\nA lot of research has been conducted in the ﬁeld of estimating crop\
    \ water irrigation needs, in\nreal time, similar to the initial Penman–Monteith\
    \ evapotranspiration models, which were initially\ndeveloped for open ﬁeld cultivations.\
    \ However, the majority of these studies indicated a drastic eﬀect\nof diﬀerent\

    \ of their simplicity and low cost [2,48]. The pan has proven its practical value\

    method.\nAs results indicated, atmometers had the best performance for estimating\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration in a greenhouse and could be used advantageously in\

    \ (i.e., lysimeters) provide the only direct measure of water ﬂux from a vegetative\n\

    \ in soil and soilless crop production in\ngreenhouses where irrigation scheduling\
    \ should match the diurnal course of evapotranspiration as\naﬀected by the prevailing\
    \ greenhouse environment through soil/substrate and crop characteristics.\nThe\
    \ majority of irrigation methods used in the past implement a feed forward or\
    \ a feedback irrigation\ndecision support system, and, in addition, water stress\
    \ indices were developed based on plant-sensing.\nHowever, a gap in commercialized\
    \ solutions exists despite the signiﬁcant research work in the ﬁeld of\nprecision\
    \ irrigation of greenhouse crops. It is important that a large margin of progress\
    \ in greenhouse\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency is managed by farmers [3].\

    content Abstract In Australia, gravity fed irrigation systems are critical infrastructure
    essential to agricultural production and export. By supplementing these large
    scale civil engineering systems with an appropriate information infrastructure,
    sensors, actuators and a communication network it is feasible to use systems engineering
    ideas to improve the exploitation of the irrigation system. This paper reports
    how classical ideas from system identification and control can be used to automate
    irrigation systems to deliver a near on-demand water supply with vastly improved
    overall distribution efficiency. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction Over the last 7 years researchers at the University of Melbourne
    have collaborated with Rubicon Systems Australia to achieve near on-demand water
    supply in open channel irrigation systems. The research and development process
    started by considering what appeared to be a case of local controllers that created
    large excursion periodic flow and water levels in the water canals, perhaps due
    to bad tuning of the controller gains. The journey went through modeling and control
    design, including the development of new sensor and actuator hardware and pilot
    projects culminating in the present industrial scale ongoing project where based
    on the developed ideas and technology a large irrigation system in Victoria is
    being fully automated. Upon completion it will be the first entire irrigation
    system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real time on demand
    in as much as this is physically realisable. This paper reports on some aspects
    of this journey. A corresponding paper trail can be found in the bibliography.
    The patents Mareels et al., 2000, Mareels et al., 2001 describe the overall systems
    engineering philosophy in conjunction with the newly developed hardware for both
    measuring and controlling water in open channels. So far the research and development
    effort has focused on controlling water quantity in open channels, as captured
    in water flow, volume and water levels. This paper is solely devoted to this issue.
    In future developments it is envisaged that water quality will become a major
    focus for control. Sensors can assess the biological and chemical content of water
    to determine its quality in real time. The information infrastructure to be discussed
    can then be used to advantage to manage water quality as well as water quantity.
    In Australia, irrigation accounts for 70% of all fresh water usage Securing our
    Water Future Together, 2004, The United Nations World Water Development Report,
    Executive Summary, 2003, Water and the Australian Economy, 1999, Water Savings
    in Irrigation Distribution Systems, 2000. The majority of irrigation is achieved
    through an extensive civil infrastructure of reservoirs and open canals that supplies
    fresh water to farms. The large scale distribution of water is powered purely
    by gravity. Also on most farms, a gravity fed system is in use, such that the
    amount of farm land that can be irrigated through the on-farm water outlet is
    directly limited by the available water level (potential energy) at the canal
    outlet, the on-farm supply point. In the reports The United Nations World Water
    Development Report, Executive Summary, 2003, Water and the Australian Economy,
    1999, Water Savings in Irrigation Distribution Systems, 2000, overall water efficiency
    in irrigation, that is the ratio of volume of water used by crops and life stock
    to volume of water extracted from the available fresh water resource is estimated
    to be less than 50%. In Australia, the losses are reportedly evenly split Water
    and the Australian Economy, 1999, Water Savings in Irrigation Distribution Systems,
    2000 between the large scale distribution losses and on-farm losses. The latter
    are to a large extent due to poor timing of irrigation, a consequence of manual
    water scheduling on the supply canals. Furthermore, the on-farm losses if coupled
    with poor drainage lead to soil degradation (irrigation–drainage imbalance induced
    salination of soils). Most of the large scale distribution losses are due to the
    natural tendency to oversupply water, as a lack of water has obviously averse
    effects on the yield. Some losses are due to evaporation and canal seepage. In
    Australia, over supplied water simply means that water spills out at the downstream
    end of the irrigation system, and is no longer available to supply irrigation.
    The water remains of course part of the natural hydro cycle. Policy makers in
    Australia have recognized that is important to re-consider present water practices
    in view of long term environmental and sustainability issues. Indeed, Australia
    is a very dry continent that presumably cannot sustain the present exploitation
    levels of its natural water resources. Climate change, population and industrial
    growth pressures compound the problem. Here, it is argued that irrigation efficiency
    is an ideal objective for closed loop control. Irrigation efficiency can be vastly
    improved by installing an information technology infrastructure: sensors and actuators
    linked through a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) communication
    network. The data derived from this can be exploited using systems identification
    and control techniques to manage the civil infrastructure to achieve superior
    efficiency and support new policies in support of long term sustainable water
    use. Besides the improved distribution efficiency, the near on-demand water delivery
    that is achieved leads to significant on-farm efficiency improvements as well.
    The system identification and control ideas to be discussed are quite classical,
    and in this way the paper illustrates the strength of the present state of the
    art in control and systems identification theory. Nevertheless, new questions
    or perhaps new emphases appear and a number of interesting open problems that
    are particularly relevant to large scale systems engineering are identified. The
    remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, a particular implementation
    of an automated, SCADA-equipped irrigation system, installed in Victoria, Australia
    is described. The physical constraints in the irrigation infrastructure, which
    ultimately limit the performance that can be achieved, are touched upon. The control
    and management objectives are briefly outlined. System modeling is discussed next.
    Models derived from the St-Venant equations and grey box models are compared as
    to their utility/effort in the context of modeling for control and fault detection.
    Next, model based control ideas are pursued. A variety of distributed control
    and centralised control strategies are briefly introduced. More importantly the
    impact of automation and the diminishing returns of increased control effort and
    control sophistication are identified. Results from the field describing the quality
    of the proposed models and controls are discussed. 2. Irrigation systems 2.1.
    Canal infrastructure Refer to Fig. 1. Through a series of open canals, water is
    distributed from reservoirs to farms under the driving force of the available
    potential energy at the reservoir. The routing and scheduling of water is realized
    through the adjustment of regulator structures (gates) placed in the canals. These
    gates restrict the water flow in the canals. A stretch of canal between up- and
    down-stream gates is called a pool. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1.
    Schematic representation of open canal infrastructure; vertical cross section
    through canal centre. A section of a canal network is represented in Fig. 2. The
    canal topology can be represented like a directed graph (nodes are regulators,
    arcs are pools, the direction is the flow). In most gravity fed systems the graph
    is a tree (but this is not always the case). Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Schematic representation of open canal topology. The discussion here focuses
    on the so-called overshot gates (FlumeGate ™ )1 that were developed in the course
    of the project. In these gates, water flows over the top of the gate leaf, the
    angle of which can be adjusted to change the amount of water that flows over it.
    The gates can operate in the overflow regime, where the down stream water level
    is below the gate level (as on the left in Fig. 1), or drowned condition, where
    the downstream level is above the gate level (as is illustrated on the right in
    Fig. 1). At the gate water levels immediately downstream and upstream of the gate
    are measured. The main farm outlets are found near the downstream end of a pool.
    In Australia, the canals are designed for flow, and are rather shallow and narrow,
    with little storage in pools. A typical slope of the canal floor is 1/10,000.
    The canals have little free board, in most instances water will spill if the water
    level would reach 0.5 m above the design level. The canal and reservoir infrastructure
    is substantial. The replacement value (for Australia) is in the order of several
    tens of billion dollars in investment. To understand the scale, consider the following
    data for a medium size irrigation district in Australia that was used in the pilot
    projects described here: 500 km of main irrigation canal; about 500 regulator
    structures in the canals; over 600 on-farm outlets; 1.1 Gm2 of farm land irrigated;
    an annual water allocation of about 0.6 Gm3. The Goulburn-Murray irrigation district,
    the largest in Australia, is more than 10 times this size (7000 km of canal; 17,000
    regulators and 21,000 on-farm outlets, annual average irrigation water allocation
    in excess of 2 Gm3) and irrigation districts in excess of 100 times this size
    exist in the USA, Pakistan, India and China. The quality of the irrigation service,
    from a farmer’s perspective, is determined by the timing of the irrigation water
    and in case the on-farm irrigation is also gravity fed, also by the water level
    at the on-farm outlet. Clearly using open canals with banks that are not water
    tight to effect water distribution implies losses through evaporation and seepage.
    The combined effect of these is estimated at around 10 to 15% of supply (Water
    and the Australian Economy, 1999). At present these losses are insufficient to
    warrant consideration of replacing the canal infrastructure by a piped water network
    (which after all also has its own problems with leaks). 2.2. Automation infrastructure
    Fig. 3 illustrates in situ the new hardware replacing the manually controlled
    on-farm outlets. During the course of the project, new sensors and actuators were
    developed which form the subject of two patent applications Mareels et al., 2000,
    Mareels et al., 2001. The actual locations for the gates in the canals are as
    determined by the existing infrastructure under manual control, and no optimization
    of gate placement, in view of the new and automated management regime, has been
    considered thus far. This is an interesting aspect of the overall system design
    that is under further investigation. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Automated gates and communication infrastructure. For the purpose of distributing
    water from reservoir to farm, all the gates both in the main canals as well as
    the on-farm outlets, are actuated and equipped with sensors for water levels and
    actual gate position (the gate angle is measured). The fact that on-farm outlets
    are also actuated and equipped with sensors enables inter alia the measurement
    of the actual water demand. Actuation and monitoring functions are typically collocated,
    and very few sole purpose actuator or monitoring sites are in use. Each gate/site
    can communicate via a cellular packet based radio network to any other site in
    the network. The communication network enables both broadcasting (e.g. for software
    upgrades) as well as peer to peer communications on all sites. A typical direct
    peer group contains up to 10 sites (see also Fig. 2). For the above described
    average irrigation district there are just over a 1000 sites, the maximum number
    of router hops for site to site communications is six, whereas a direct communication
    to the centralnode requires at most three router hops. For reasons of security
    and reliability, the network management overhead in data communication is large,
    and the actual net data throughput is very low (measured in bits per second).
    The required data rate for control purposes is kept to a minimum by using event
    driven communication and by using a particular decentralized control structure.
    Event based communication means that measurement data are only communicated when
    a water level change (a gate movement or a set point change) exceeds a predetermined
    threshold. Even then, the sensor data must compete with other event driven communications
    such as demanded by various hardware and software alarms. As a consequence the
    time required to successfully complete a communication cannot be guaranteed with
    certainty. Although and this is confirmed by experience over a few irrigation
    seasons, the design methods for the communication network are such that with very
    high confidence the maximum communication delay for a data packet can be specified.
    The other technique used to minimize the data rate requirements is the particular
    decentralized control structure that is implemented. It is such that water demand
    information only has to be passed on to the nearest upstream regulator, which
    only requires a peer to peer session, without supervisory intervention. Moreover,
    the central supervisory control node does not need regular sampling of sensors
    and/or actuator states and can use the event driven data to implement global network
    policies. Locally, at the gate level, all data about sensors, actuators and hardware
    conditions are monitored on a regularly sampled basis, and a long history of all
    variables is maintained in memory. At the central node, a global data base of
    all reported and requested events is maintained. In this data base, the topology
    of both the information network and the irrigation network is also stored. This
    topology is further enhanced by descriptors for all models for pools, regulators
    and sensors, and the corresponding control algorithms. 2.3. Objectives From a
    real-time control point of view the main objectives are: • optimization of distribution
    efficiency, i.e. minimize the total amount of water supplied by matching supply
    to demand. Maximal distribution efficiency is attained when there is a zero outflow
    at the bottom end of the canal tree; • real-time on-demand water supply of the
    requested water volumes to all irrigation outlets; and • water level regulation
    at the on-farm outlet to a given set point (within an agreed dead-band limit).
    The supervisory control has to ensure that the physical flow capacities are not
    exceeded, that the water set points are as agreed by the stake holders and that
    the distributed water remains within the allocations set by the regulating bodies
    (as modified by water trade). Clearly, the supervisory control task is in itself
    a dynamic object. The supervisory control system receives demand requests by the
    farmers through an automated ordering system. These orders are verified, if the
    water order is legitimate and if there is the physical capacity to supply before
    the water order is processed. If rejected, the water order can be rescheduled
    to an agreed time. The supervisory control system can suggest alternative time
    slots for the water order. These aspects are not discussed further. That some
    form of rescheduling is in general unavoidable is clear from the histogram in
    Fig. 4. It shows the distribution of regulator sizes (in flow m3/s) for one section
    of the above irrigation system. The total on-farm installed outflow capacity in
    this section is close to 25 m3/s, which is a little more than four times the inflow
    capacity (the in flow capacity at the top regulator is 6.1 m3/s). This is typical
    across the entire irrigation system. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    4. Histogram of regulator sizes in m3/s at the downstream end in a typical irrigation
    district. Equally important from a management perspective is to keep track of
    water flow and water volumes, as well as the general condition of the irrigation
    canals (e.g. leakage detection, evaporation losses, hardware failures). 3. Models
    for irrigation systems Understanding the behaviour of the irrigation system is
    key to arriving at an acceptable closed loop control solution. The natural subsystems
    in irrigation systems are a single pool and the regulator structures. Given the
    topology of the irrigation system, an entire model is then but the concatenation
    of pool and regulator models as dictated by the system topology (see Fig. 2).
    3.1. St-Venant equation based models Traditionally, open channel dynamics are
    described using the shallow water equations, or the so called St-Venant equations
    Brutsaert, 1971, Chaudhry, 1993, Cunge et al., 1980. One particular representation
    is given by (1) which models the mass balance along the length of the pool, and
    (2) which models the momentum balance along the length of the pool. Here, is time,
    and is a position along the centre line of the pool, where is the length of the
    i th pool. In (1), (2), is the water cross section at position xalong the center
    line of pool i at time t (it equals the local depth of water times the width of
    the canal). is the width of the pool at position x, it is assumed that the cross
    section of the canal is rectangular. The width information can be obtained either
    from design drawings, or perhaps more interestingly from satellite images. is
    the total flow in m3/s through the cross section . represents the flow off-take
    per meter canal (in m2/s) at position x. This term models not only a farm outlet,
    or an off-take into another pool/canal but also accounts for seepage and evaporation
    (hence the potential dependence on time, as seepage is subject to seasonal variation
    and evaporation experiences seasonal and diurnal variations). The represents the
    momentum loss per meter canal, due to friction but also water off-takes, seepage
    and evaporation. represents the slope of the bottom of pool i. The latter represents
    essentially the available potential energy per meter canal. The constant represents
    gravitational acceleration. The friction term is a nonlinear function of flow
    and area, for which various empirical formulas exist. Here, modeled as time-invariant,
    although slow time variations can be expected due to effects such as bank erosion
    and plant growth. The boundary conditions are the inflow into the top-end of the
    pool and the outflow at the bottom-end of the pool. These are to be derived from
    the hydraulic characteristics of the regulating structures at the up- and down-stream
    end of the pools. For , this will typically be a discharge from a reservoir, or
    major feed canal. for each of the end pools is to be minimised, ideally zero outflow
    is to be achieved. For the other boundary conditions , where is the hydraulic
    characteristic for that regulator, and is the control variable, which enables
    the variation of the flow through this regulator. Hydraulic characteristics can
    be determined from experimental data. Hydraulic characteristics essentially relate
    geometry of the regulator, as captured by the down and up-stream water conditions
    and the gate position to flow over the regulator. To complete the model for the
    purpose of prediction an initial condition has to be provided, a suitable starting
    point is a steady state flow condition (zero flow for example). The models (1),
    (2) are nonlinear partial differential equations, which can be solved using a
    numerical integration scheme. Typically, a Preismann scheme, which involves using
    a discretisation in both space and time domain Chaudhry, 1993, Cunge et al., 1980
    is advocated. Despite the obvious physical interpretation that is associated with
    the variables, and the clear validity of the principles on which the St-Venant
    equations are constructed, these equations represent a considerable modeling cost
    when they are to be applied to a particular canal. In order for the model to become
    relevant to a particular canal, or pool it is necessary to fit functions like
    , , and . Typically this involves providing a parametric representation for these
    functions, and then estimating the parameters, using say non-linear least squares
    techniques, from a history of measurements. The mapping from the discrete values
    of flow and cross sections at certain positions along the canal, and at certain
    time instances to the parameters is not trivial. One such approach is discussed
    in some detail in (Ooi, Krutzen, & Weyer, 2003). It is shown there that the St-Venant
    equations are indeed adequate for the purpose of modeling of open channel behaviour.
    This study uses data from Australian irrigation canals. An earlier study (Brutsaert,
    1971)also shows the adequacy of the St-Venant equation using a similarity study
    under laboratory conditions. Despite this, it is not clear that the cost of establishing
    an accurate quantitative model using this route is actually justified in the context
    of irrigation systems. Moreover, it is also not obvious that the St-Venant equations
    represent the most appropriate starting point for management and/or control of
    irrigation systems. In a nutshell, the advantage of the St-Venant equations, with
    the corresponding boundary and initial conditions, are: • familiar and physically
    relevant variables are modeled; • parameters have an obvious physical interpretation;
    • interpolation across all time and space (simulation information not limited
    to discrete sample points); and • an expectation to be reliable across a broad
    range of operating conditions. These have to be weighted against the obvious disadvantages:
    • significant cost in achieving quantitatively reliable models from discrete data;
    • significant cost, perhaps prohibitive cost to simulate an entire canal or irrigation
    system; and • relevance beyond the operational regimes remains questionable as
    it cannot be verified against real data. There is a more philosophical and more
    fundamental objection rooted in the way the St-Venant equations are actually used.
    As the St-Venant equations do not permit analytic solutions they are by necessity
    numerically integrated using some discretisation scheme. One could therefore argue
    that for all practical purposes the St-Venant equations are merely an abstraction
    (and perhaps a poor one). Clearly only the finite dimensional numerical approximation,
    a computer algorithm, is the real model. It is this computer algorithm that is
    tuned against the data and that forms the actual model and that predicts the actual
    behaviour. This begs a number of natural questions: • Can this finite dimensional
    and discrete time/space model not be considered as the basis for control design?
    • Which discretisation scheme is the most appropriate for control design? After
    all, only a small portion of the open-loop behaviour is targeted in closed-loop
    operation and there may be better schemes than the Preismann scheme. • Perhaps
    the model may be further simplified using model order reduction techniques to
    represent only adequately the smaller closed loop behaviour Litrico and Fromion,
    2004, Litrico et al., 2003. Rather than pursuing these questions from a St-Venant
    equation perspective, which leads to several interesting open problems in the
    study of infinite dimensional systems, they are pursued directly from a data-to-model
    system identification perspective. 3.2. Grey box models The above motivates the
    consideration of a grey box, lumped model approach to construct a model for a
    pool adequate for control design in an irrigation system Eurén and Weyer, 2005,
    Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi, 2003, Ooi et al., 2005, Weyer, 2001.
    It should be observed that significant simplifications as compared to the full
    complexity of the St-Venant equations may be expected as the management regime
    in an irrigation system requires tight control over the water levels, despite
    significant variations in flow. Hence, the model does not have to explain the
    behaviour over all possible water levels. What is minimally required is a model
    that links the control input which is the gate position at regulator i (a regulator
    may have several gates in parallel, but this issue is ignored to simplify the
    presentation) to water levels and flows at the critical points along the canals,
    typically the up- ( ) and down-stream water levels at the regulators. With reference
    to Fig. 5 consider a canal where all pools are simply in line. To further simplify
    the exposition, assume that the regulators are overshot gates in free-flow conditions.
    In this situation, the downstream water levels at the regulators are largely irrelevant.
    The ideas can be applied mutatis mutandis to other situations as well, including
    the more complicated situations with under shot regulators and drowned overshot
    gates (Eurén & Weyer, 2005). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. In-line
    canal system, a series of regulators and pools. The flow over the regulator i
    is a static function determined by the geometry of the regulator, which is varied
    by the gate position and the supply water level at the regulator site. This relationship
    is the hydraulic characteristic for the regulator, (3) Besides the hydraulic characteristic,
    a model for the dynamics of the pool is required. This model is in its simplest
    form a mass balance, the volume of water in the pool is increased by the flow
    over the up-stream regulator and decreased by the flow over the down-stream regulator.
    In Mareels et al., 2000, Mareels et al., 2001, Weyer, 2001, a model is proposed
    that captures conservation of mass, and the first mode of standing waves in a
    pool: (4) A continuous time model is used, as in general regular sampling is not
    available. This is therefore the preferred embodiment of the model. Although for
    identification purposes it is clear that the above model only requires local information
    at the upstream and downstream gate of the pool. In this situation, it is possible
    to obtain regularly sampled and synchronized data series of the water levels and
    gate positions for any particular pool. In (4), is the water level upstream of
    regulator i; is a time-delay. It is associated with the fastest wave phenomena
    in the pool between gates i and (which can be linked to the critical velocity
    in the pool (Chaudhry, 1993)). An action on the upstream end of the pool is observed
    at the downstream end of the pool after time units. The model dynamics are captured
    via the polynomial . For short pools, up to a few km in length, a polynomial of
    degree 3 suffices to achieve a high fidelity model. For such pools, the roots
    of consist of an integrator and a weakly damped oscillatory pair. The integrator
    captures the idea of water storage in the pool. The oscillatory roots capture
    the dynamics associated with the dominant standing wave(s) in the pool. The terms
    represent water off-takes between regulator i and and the are static gains. (Most
    off-takes are placed near the down-stream end of the pool, which simplifies the
    model, and ensures better quality of service for the farmer, as the down stream
    water level can be regulated more easily than the up stream water level.) Typical
    order of magnitudes for the various parameters in the Australian irrigation districts
    where field trials have been conducted thus far are: • time delay is approximately
    3 min per km; • dominant wave period is approximately 9 min per km; and • achievable
    (closed loop) dominant time constant is approximately 10 to 15 min per km. The
    parameters appearing in (4) are readily obtained via standard linear system identification
    techniques. This can be done both from open loop experiments as well as from closed
    loop data Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi and Weyer, 2001, Ooi et al.,
    2005, Weyer, 2001. The latter is critically important when considering a large
    scale irrigation system. The grey box model (4) compares favourably with the St-Venant
    models (1), (2) in that it has much lower complexity and yet similar or better
    prediction accuracy (see below and Fig. 6). Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. Experimental validation of grey box and St-Venant based models. Validation
    tests across both low and high flow regimes have been completed. In Fig. 6, adapted
    from Ooi, Krutzen, & Weyer, 2003, a comparison is made between the St-Venant based
    models and the grey box models. The Fig. 6 represents a set of open-loop simulated
    model responses compared against the actual field measurements. The inputs to
    the simulation are the regulator positions over time (using the measured positions),
    and the initial water level condition. The data set for the modeling and validation
    are from different irrigation seasons. The least accurate model, which is still
    very useful, is the St-Venant model where the model parameters are not tuned to
    the actual pool but guestimated based on a rule of thumb. The response is the
    dashed line in Fig. 6. This model is by no means disgraced. The other St-Venant
    model has its parameters (a model for the friction was adjusted) optimally selected
    based on field observations. Its response is dash–dot line in Fig. 6. These models
    are compared against a grey box model that uses a third order model, (leaky) integrator
    and standing waves and a first order grey box model that only captures the (leaky)
    integrator trends. The grey box models have been identified from open-loop experiments.
    All models are reasonably accurate. From a simulation perspective, the best model,
    based on quality for effort, is the third order grey box model. For control purposes
    the first order grey box model will suffice, when the wave phenomena are appropriately
    considered in the closed loop design (Weyer, 2003a). 3.3. Automated model building
    Given the size of a typical irrigation system automated model building and model
    maintenance is essential. Model maintenance must be performed within the constraints
    imposed by normal management conditions. As demonstrated in (Ooi & Weyer, 2001)
    the grey box model (4) allow for simple calibration of the parameters under closed
    loop conditions. A few hours of data, using permitted changes in the water level
    reference set points, exploiting the available dead band, suffices to tune the
    model parameters. Such variation is allowed under normal operating conditions
    as the typical dead band for the set point regulation is of the order of 10 cm
    (under manual operation, water levels were deemed acceptably regulated when less
    than 30 cm away from set points). Fig. 7 taken from (Ooi & Weyer, 2001)compares
    a validation data set (black solid line) with a simulation (dotted line) based
    on a model derived from closed loop data. Only 90 min of closed loop data with
    minimal set point variations were used to derive the relevant parameters of a
    first order grey box model (4) that sufficed for control design purposes. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Validating closed loop system identification,
    using grey box models. It is important to notice that the tuning of the model
    for a particular pool is inherently a decentralized task. It involves only data
    gathered from the up-stream and down-stream regulators. Given the available compute
    engines at the various monitoring sites a model update can be performed locally
    using peer-to-peer communications. Once the modeling or model maintenance is completed,
    the new model parameters can be communicated to the central node, which requires
    very little communication resources, as it only involves a few coefficients to
    be updated. In case of hardware failures (Choy & Weyer, 2005), like a regulator
    break-down, or sensor failure, an alarm is raised that also triggers a model update
    (and if necessary a control law update) to reflect the new dynamics. A model for
    an entire irrigation system is constructed from the logical interconnection of
    the individual pool models. 3.4. An open modeling issue The apparent data-based
    validation of both a St-Venant partial differential equation model and a low order
    grey box model within the present context poses an interesting and open question
    in model order reduction Besancon et al., 2001, Litrico and Fromion, 2004, Litrico
    et al., 2003. Under what conditions and in what sense can the grey box model (4)
    be considered as an approximation for the coupled partial differential equation
    model (1) and (2). This question is not only of academic interest. The basic parameters
    in the grey box model have a physical meaning, the dominant time constant, the
    wave period and time-delay are all related to the behaviour of the St-Venant equations.
    If the relationship between the St-Venant equations and the grey box model is
    better understood it may be possible to derive a simple map, a rule of thumb,
    linking physical parameters like pool length, critical velocity, Manning coefficient
    (an important parameter describing the friction losses in open channel flow) to
    a reasonable first guess for the coefficients in the grey box model. At present
    such a map is essentially being constructed from experience. An answer to the
    above open problem would provide a sound theoretical basis for such a rule of
    thumb. The question is not trivial in that even taking into account that the water
    levels are reasonably tightly controlled the St-Venant Eq. (2) remain highly nonlinear
    due to their nonlinear dependence on the flow. Hence classical model order reduction
    techniques do not apply. The situation is a nonlinear version of the classical
    lumped parameter Pi and T-section approximations used in electrical power engineering
    to represent a transmission line. Transmission line equations are linear St-Venant
    equations. 3.5. On-line model uses The need for a low complexity model structure
    like the grey box model cannot be argued solely on the basis of simulation or
    control design requirements. Indeed simulation and most control design techniques
    only use the model in an off-line capacity in which complexity plays a lesser
    role. (In the course of this project we have as yet not pursued model predictive
    control ideas for which low complexity models are definitely an advantage.) The
    model is used in the supervisory control to determine the limits of physical capability
    of the irrigation system to meet demand. Off-line an approximate table can be
    constructed that indicates which demand can be met in real time, but it is simpler
    and more accurate to actually calculate from the present state of the model forward
    to verify that the physical constraints can be satisfied (the present scheduling
    policy works on a first come first served basis). The model has however far more
    important on-line uses, which justify a low order complexity model. The main on-line
    use of the model is in fault detection and fault isolation. The single most valuable
    use of the model in this respect is the identification in real-time of leaks,
    which are identified and localized, as a (significant) difference between water
    levels predicted by the model and actually achieved water levels as measured by
    the sensors. The development of fault detection methods that exploit the full
    capabilities of the model and sensory data is ongoing. 4. Control for irrigation
    systems In the following discussion, consider a series of in-line pools (see Fig.
    5), and assume overshot gates at the regulators. Other approaches, not discussed
    here, for control of canals can be found in Halleux et al., 2003, Malaterre and
    Baume, 1998, Schuurmans et al., 1999. From a control perspective, and to simplify
    the discussion, the predictive models discussed above can be further simplified.
    Indeed, as the wave dynamics of the pools are not to be excited, because the free
    space in the canals above the water level is not designed to cope with standing
    waves, this part of the model may be ignored for control design as long as the
    design ensures that the waves are not going to be excited. The main wave frequency
    from the model is thus an important input into the control design process, it
    determines the bandwidth of the closed loop system. With this simplification,
    and introducing appropriate scaling and some abuse of notation, the pool dynamics,
    represented in continuous time, are given by (5) The index irefers to the regulator
    i, . The are the input variables, which are actually nonlinear functions of the
    gate positions and the water levels at the regulator. This representation globally
    linearises the non-linear behaviour of the canal; although the inputs are constrained
    in that . The disturbance is the total water off-take from pool i (upstream of
    regulator and downstream from regulator i). As discussed above, it is (almost)
    a measurable disturbance, although some aspects of the off-take term cannot be
    measured directly. Evaporation, seepage and unscheduled off-takes caused by bank
    erosion or bank collapse are clearly difficult to measure directly. The evaporation
    and seepage are only a small fraction of the total off-take, and the unscheduled
    off-takes can be identified from the model. The simplest control objective is
    to ensure that (no outflow at the bottom regulator) and that all are regulated
    to their reference values , (within a deadband). In this case, setpoint regulation
    automatically delivers water on demand, provided that in steady state demand is
    within the capacity constraint, that is for all . 4.1. Decentralised Control A
    decentralized control design is discussed in detail in (Weyer, 2002) see also
    (Li, Cantoni, & Weyer, 2005). The main features are that the upstream regulator
    input is used to regulate the water level based on information that is available
    at the down stream regulator and the local regulator i as well as the measured
    off-take on the pool i. The controller can thus be implemented using a peer-to-peer
    communication session. is set to zero. Assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that the
    off-take is measurable, the decentralized control law takes the form: (6) Here,
    and . is the feed forward control part and implements local feedback. This leads
    to the closed loop being described by (7) with and and (8) This representation
    shows clearly how disturbances propagate upstream; affects all for . The decentralised
    design is by necessity a trade-off between how much the local disturbance is rejected
    from the water level and how these disturbances propagate upstream, the effect
    on for . The transfer function governing the upstream propagation of disturbances
    is (9) the local rejection is governed by (10) The critical element in these transfer
    functions is the delay. A similar argument can be developed for when the off-take
    is not measurable. In this case, the control law takes the form (11) starting
    with . The corresponding closed loop is described by the iteration ( ) (12) which
    describes the regulator inputs and (13) which describes the error-propagation.
    Here, (14) and (15) 4.2. Decentralised control, without off-take measurements
    When the off-takes may not be measured, the feedback must include an integrator
    in order to reject the off-take disturbances . This makes the control design much
    more challenging as the plant also contains an integrator. In the presence of
    a double integrator and having to contend with the unavoidable delay in the transfer
    functions , , and (see Eqs. (9), (10), (14), (15)), it can be shown that is now
    impossible to avoid that water levels errors are amplified as they propagate upstream
    along the canal. In (Li et al., 2005), it is demonstrated that for any linear
    (stable) design . The way to arrive at a good design is to achieve strong disturbance
    rejection by way of ensuring that . In this way, even very long chains of pools
    can be adequately controlled.2 The design proceeds in two phases, first stability/robustness
    is guaranteed for the local pool dynamics (design emphasis on ); a phase margin
    of about 40∘ and a gain margin of about 10 dB is considered adequate. A feedback
    consisting of a PI controller, with low pass filter as to avoid the excitation
    of the wave dynamics, i.e. , can achieve this goal. The feed forward term is essentially
    a low pass filter, again to ensure that waves are not excited. Moreover, the feed
    forward term must be designed with care to avoid the amplification of disturbances
    along the canal. To complete the design, the control objectives are verified against
    the entire system dynamics. This boils down to the non-trivial verification of
    the transfer functions . Figs. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 illustrate the response of the
    decentralized controller (PI + filter) under a control test scenario on one of
    the main canals. The set point is the dash–dot line and the solid line is the
    recorded water level realized by the controller. Several set point changes and
    disturbances occur over the period of time (a bit more than a day’s worth of data
    is displayed). The controller maintains the water level to better than 5 cm. Download

    Assuming that the off-takes are measured, it is possible to use a simple lead–lag
    controller in the feedback path ( ) and a simple low pass filter in the feed forward
    path. The design is somewhat simplified in this situation as compared to the design
    based on the integrator in the feedback path. The only relevant transfer functions
    are and , which makes it indeed somewhat easier to achieve acceptable gain and
    phase margins as well as disturbance rejection. The main design problem concerns
    the feed forward action, as this dominates the error propagation along the canals.
    As the design is only marginally easier than the PI based design, the PI based
    design, which has greater robustness with respect to off-takes, is to be preferred.
    4.4. Centralised control Based on the model (5) linear quadratic methods as well
    as design methods may be pursued to deliver a global controller see Li et al.,
    2004, Li et al., 2005, Weyer, 2003c. These serve as benchmarks for the decentralized
    controllers. The information infrastructure briefly discussed above does not enable
    one to implement a central control strategy across an entire irrigation district.
    Linear quadratic, centralised controllers have been field tested in smallish irrigation
    systems. Besides serving as a benchmark for the decentralized controllers, a centralized
    control law can be used to derive an acceptable decentralized controller, through
    pruning the weaker input–output connections. To complete an adequate linear quadratic
    design it is essential to augment the state of the system (water levels ) with
    the integrals of the regulation errors ( ) and states to describe high pass filtered
    input variables (emphasizing the frequency content above the standing wave frequency
    of the pool that can be effected by the particular input variable). The latter
    are essential to avoid excitation of standing waves in the pools. A linear quadratic
    design completed along these lines provides an overall responsiveness better than
    what can be achieved using the above decentralized controller, with acceptable
    robustness properties. The design process is however much more demanding. In particular
    the selection of the quadratic weights so as to achieve an intuitively acceptable
    response is a time-consuming task. The intuition derived from the decentralized
    controller can be used to better advantage in an design. The decentralized controller
    can be used to deliver the loop shaping that is required to achieve a high gain
    in the low frequency band (to reject the load disturbances), a 20 dB/dec roll
    off around the cross over frequency (which is limited by the wave frequency) to
    achieve sufficient phase margin, and faster roll-off around and beyond the wave
    frequencies. Using the decentralized controller to guide the selection of the
    loop shaping frequency dependent weights, allows the design method to deliver
    a very robust and high performing controller that satisfies all control requirements.
    The resulting controller is a global controller, with a performance similar to
    a well designed linear quadratic controller. The advantage is that the design
    effort is much smaller than what is required for the linear quadratic controller,
    and entirely comparable to the decentralized controller. Field tests are planned
    for the near future. 4.5. A law of diminishing returns In order to appreciate
    the benefit that may be derived from the various control scenarios, a comparison
    is made between: • manual control, the present situation, where water orders are
    averaged, and water regulation is effected once every 24 h by manually adjusting
    the regulator structures. • decentralized control, without feed forward; PI + filter
    design using a simple anti-windup scheme. • decentralized control, with feed forward;
    PI + filter design using a simple anti-windup scheme. • global, centralized control
    (using a linear quadratic regulator). The comparison is based on a three-pool
    simulation, where the scenarios have been implemented on an equal footing. All
    control implementations encounter identical circumstances. The scenario stretches
    over a 9-day period. It involves: • A water order cancellation. Half-way through
    the simulation, a water order (45 h long order of 37,500 m3) is cancelled. Farmers
    can order water, typically 4 days in advance, but are allowed to cancel the order
    with only one hour notice. This is a very demanding scenario from a manual regulation
    point of view, but realistic. • A 2.5-cm rain event that last for 10 h. Under
    rain conditions, farmers are allowed to stop irrigation. This leads to an emergency
    stop of the irrigation system, which is virtually impossible to control well under
    manual operations. • Ten normal water orders, of various length and magnitude.
    The water orders are organized as per typical manual operations, so as to create
    a situation advantageous for manual operations. The scenario is illustrated in
    Fig. 11, in which the head over the most upstream regulator is indicated. This
    illustrates the water supply into the canal, which is the main control action
    to implement the down stream requested water orders. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 11. Water supply over a 9 day period into an irrigation canal. The
    results are that any of the automated methods achieve all the water orders as
    requested and avoid spilling water during the rain condition. The decentralized
    control strategies achieve 100% water efficiency in that no water is spilled over
    the most down stream regulator. The linear quadratic regulator controller achieves
    quicker and better water level regulation (barely noticeable) and an overall efficiency
    of 99%. (The LQ regulator sacrifices a minimal amount of water in favour of achieving
    a better water level regulation.) Of course this is not the whole story, nevertheless
    this particular simulation study suggests that there is little incentive to implement
    a centralized control strategy. The corresponding water level response in the
    most down stream pool is illustrated in Fig. 12. This pool is the most difficult
    to manage well under manual control. Typically the bottom end of the irrigation
    system experiences poor quality of service under manual operations. The same Figure
    illustrates that using the decentralized controllers there is saturation during
    the rain event (regulators are closed) and at the end of the irrigation period,
    when there is a small excess of water supply without outflow. This water supplied
    in excess is stored in the most down stream pool. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 12. Waterlevel response in the most downstream pool. Under manual operations,
    the overall efficiency was 80% (which is very good compared to historical averages,
    typical best practice manual operation achieves an efficiency of about 70%). The
    quality of service is however poor, despite the fact that the water orders were
    placed as to be advantageous to manual control. Only 90% of the water orders is
    met. The water levels dropped below the minimum required to satisfy the requested
    demand over about 10% of the total duration. Moreover, during the rain period,
    the most down stream pool flooded its banks for about a day. The rain period only
    lasted for 10 h, but there was a significant water flow imbalance at the beginning
    of the rain period, which together with the slow response of manual control, aggravated
    the rain effect to cause significant flooding. To observe substantial differences
    between the different forms of automated, real-time, irrigation management, larger
    canal systems must be compared. Various scenarios have been simulated, and it
    quickly becomes clear that decentralized control with feed forward (and anti-windup)
    achieves near global optimal performance. In most scenarios its performance cannot
    be distinguished from centralized control (which cannot be implemented) and it
    is substantially better than the decentralized control without feed forward. The
    latter suffers from a larger variation in water levels, and cannot always supply
    water orders as requested because water levels fall below the agreed minimum supply
    point. 4.6. Implementation issues There are two main implementation issues to
    contend with: sampling and saturation. As pointed out, the information infrastructure
    does not allow for regular sampling. Globally sampling is performed on an event
    basis (e.g. only the time that a water level changes by 2 cm up or down is reported),
    although locally, at each site regular sampling is performed. The decentralized
    controller does not suffer, as it only uses local information. A global controller
    must be designed as to cope with rather varying information rates and delays across
    the range of variables it requires to compute the control inputs. Substantial
    further research work is necessary. This issue is at the heart of so called network
    control. An alternative approach to communication limited control is exposed in
    for example (Nair, Evans, Mareels, & Moran, 2004), where an information theoretic
    point of view is pursued. The latter identifies the minimum data rates required
    to achieve stability. It turns out that in the case at hand, as the instability
    in the plant is limited to a chain of integrators that any non-zero communication
    rate suffices to achieve stability. Of course, this does not imply good performance,
    but it indicates that the required communication cannot be demanding. This is
    in-line with the present engineering solution and experience. Saturation issues
    can be addressed using anti-windup control ideas. The design can be completed,
    and consequently adapted as to ensure smooth feedback without integrator saturation
    Zaccarian et al., 2004, Zaccarian et al., 2004. Simple anti-windup control is
    implemented. 4.7. Open issues There are a number of interesting open aspects from
    a theoretical point of view that have received little attention in the control
    literature. In particular, event-based sampling and disturbance propagation in
    the irrigation system require further work. The latter is made difficult because
    of the combination of marginally stable open loop dynamics combined with delays.
    Although no single pool dynamics is dominated by delay effects, the concatenation
    of many similar systems in a tree like structure makes this an interesting and
    difficult problem, see Li et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005 for first results in the
    case of a string of identical pools. This work addresses the worst case scenario.
    What is important is to understand the average case, where there is a certain
    (natural) distribution of delays and pool dynamics. The key ingredient in understanding
    the propagation of disturbances through the system is to understand the role of
    the feed forward control in balancing the requirement for providing information
    to speed up the response, and yet limiting this information so as not to amplify
    the disturbances. Another interesting open problem that has received not enough
    attention in the control literature is to determine an appropriate structure for
    a decentralized controller. This is a problem of determining the appropriate information
    structure for control design, or which inputs/outputs are best paired with each
    other. As, the number of different decentralized controller structures is combinatorially
    large, exhaustive evaluation is simply not feasible, hence relevant heuristics
    should be developed. One ad hoc solution method, exploited in the present work,
    is to use sequential minimum variance (Weyer, 2003b), based on a particular ordering
    of the variables to be regulated. Another is to start from a global centralized
    control design, and to prune the input-output connections based on an appropriate
    singular value decomposition. In the present application, both approaches lead
    rather quickly to the proposed solution method. In sequential minimum variance,
    the ordering of the variables that leads to the above decentralized controller
    structure is to place the highest priority on the outflow , next the most down
    stream water level , then the next water level and so on. 5. Discussion Systems
    engineering principles as discussed here have been implemented in support of irrigation
    system management in a number of pilot projects in Victoria, Australia, with excellent
    outcomes in terms of achieved overall water savings and quality of service: water
    distribution efficiency of better than 90% (essentially only the unremovable losses
    due to evaporation and seepage remain), compared to 70% achieved under manual
    operations; combined with an ability to meet water requests on-demand in better
    than 90% of all water orders. All of this is achieved together with much better
    regulation accuracy, which improves the quality of service to the customers in
    a significant way. On the basis of these outcomes large scale implementation in
    Victoria has commenced. The white paper on water released by the State Government
    of Victoria identified that the implementation of advanced control, along the
    lines expounded here, will save about 400 Mm3of water per year when completed
    across all of the irrigation districts in Victoria. This volume of savings nearly
    equals the total annual water consumption for all domestic and industrial use
    in the State of Victoria. This figure is based on a conservative extrapolation
    of the actually achieved water savings in the pilot projects to date (only need
    to achieve half the success achieved in the pilot projects thus far). Similar
    studies conducted in a New South Wales report even greater saving potentials (The
    Business of Saving Water—the Report of the Murrumbidgee Valley Water Efficiency
    Project, n.d.). The economic benefits that can be derived from such water savings
    initiatives are immense. The (The Business of Saving Water—the Report of the Murrumbidgee
    Valley Water Efficiency Project, n.d.)report indicates economic benefits in the
    order of $500 M when a water saving target of 1 Gm3 would be realised. An important
    outcome of the information infrastructure is that management, and indeed the community
    at large, can be much better informed about the capabilities of the irrigation
    system; how much water was used, when and where it was used. Already, changes
    in the way irrigators use water can be observed, as a more responsive distribution
    system enables them to use more water efficient on-farm practices. This results
    in even more water savings or better economic returns for the farmers. The present
    positive results encourage the expansion of the research and development ideas
    to consider other aspects of water distribution, on-farm as well as urban. The
    outcomes realized are a small step towards the goal set forth in the UNESCO Water
    Report (2003) that fresh water management must happen on the scale of entire water
    catchments. Acknowledgements Over the last 7 years, different aspects of the work

    networking for distributed data collection and control in production agriculture
    requires a network with versatile capability to manage communications between
    mobile nodes and fixed nodes. A network protocol named AG-NETS has been developed
    to meet distributed control needs in production agriculture. The AG-NETS protocol
    works with other networking layers to efficiently deliver data packets across
    different media to extend the physical range often required for control networks
    in agriculture. This protocol is an efficient means of providing this necessary
    versatility. Short explicit and automatic implicit messages minimize network traffic.
    The AG-NETS protocol has low network overhead and can be implemented on most microcontrollers
    even those with low memory resources. Implementation of the AG-NETS protocol is
    presented using closed-loop control of site-specific irrigation management as
    an example application. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) Share Facebook

    Montenegro I. Introduction Wall street guru George Gilder says “Information quality
    power is one of the greatest business opportunities of our time”. However, over
    the last thirty years, neglect as well as lack of investment has resulted in the
    sorry state of our current infrastructure for generating and delivering power.
    Currently, over 60% of the equipments need replacement [1]. Despite significant
    advances in electronics and information technology during this time, the North
    American power grid (as well as power grids in other continents) still continue
    to use technology from the nineteenth and the early twentieth century. Electromechanical
    relays (e.g., Buchholz relays) and equipments are still the order of the day.
    On one hand, such an obsolete grid presents significant challenges in transmitting
    power reliably and efficiently, on the other hand the demands of the consumers
    have kept on increasing for providing larger amount of energy more efficiently
    and reliably at a lower cost. It is to be noted that reliability is a main concern
    in managing a expansive power grid (consider the 2003 blackout). Today, energy
    is one of the principal driving factors of the global information economy; failure
    to deliver power reliably and efficiently can have disastrous consequences. With
    the proliferation of digital and analog devices being used in mission-critical
    environments, the need for delivery of high quality power becomes more critical.

    In Australia gravity fed irrigation systems are critical infrastructure essential
    to agricultural production and export. By supplementing these large scale civil
    engineering systems with an appropriate information infrastructure, sensors, actuators
    and a communication network it is feasible to use systems engineering ideas to
    improve the exploitation of the irrigation system. This paper reports how classical
    ideas from system identification and control can be used to automate irrigation
    systems to deliver a near on-demand water supply with vastly improved overall
    distribution efficiency. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    a communication network; it is thus feasible to use systems engineering ideas
    to monitor the system in real-time and to develop methodologies for detecting
    and providing approximate locations of leaks (Mareels et al., 2005). Leakage diagnosis

    have become the main subjects of different studies in the last decades, due to
    their high influence on crop performance indicators. This study presents the most
    important parameters that have to be monitored in an irrigation management system
    and the most important ones are synthesized: air moisture and temperature, soil
    air and moisture, evapotranspiration. Based on the monitoring of these parameters,
    different control strategies and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency
    of irrigation systems. The synthesis in this paper starts with classical control
    systems and, also, advanced methods such as fuzzy concept, decision support systems
    and model predictive control. Considering the currently necessity of integration
    into the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) concept, the paper finally proposes an irrigation
    control system for vineyards. The SCADA architecture is suitable for the Romanian
    context, it allows flexibility and ease of use and it reduced both energy consumption
    and irrigation operation costs. Published in: 2017 9th IEEE International Conference

    IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation
    quality is a crop performance indicator, its influence being realized both directly
    and indirectly. If we refer to the high quantity of water that crops need, we
    see it as a direct influence factor, as soon as its indirectly role could be seen
    in the influence on the other nutrients availability and on the timing of cultural
    operations. Irrigation requirements are very different from a region to another,
    thus energy efficiency and economic use of water resources depend on a function
    of soil and crop type, climate and moisture [20]. Many factors influence the potential
    water-use efficiency. The meaning of the word potential refers to the maximum
    water-use efficiency that can be achieved when the system is operated properly.
    Global temperature has increased with 0.2-0.3 [ºC] in the last 30 years. The growing
    season in viticulture is very influenced by high or low temperatures. [17] has
    shown that for a 1, 2 or 3 [ºC] rise of temperature, it will also be a crop water
    demand increase with 11%, 19% and even 29%. This paper presents an energy efficient
    proposed system for irrigation management in vineyards. To understand the system
    structure, section II presents the monitored parameters with a huge influence
    on crop productivity. Section III show the main advanced control methods currently
    used in irrigation management, due to the necessity of an advanced irrigation
    system able to manage the installation and receive alerts. The integrated automation
    and telemetry solution for irrigation management in precision agriculture considering
    criteria to energy efficiency and economics, along with the latest control technologies
    is proposed in section IV. SECTION II. Monitored Parameters in Irrigation Management
    Precision of measurements is of high importance in vineyards productivity, modern
    techniques frequently used is focused on the optimization of the oenological potential
    that vineyards have. Precision viticulture is characterized by a crop that is
    dependent of a specific region climate and soil type. This dependence expresses
    the weather influence in vineyards and some of the arguments that support this
    idea are: Daily temperature trend has a huge influence on the grape quality and,
    consequently, on wine [15]; Bunch temperature offers an information related to
    the phenolic compounds maturation [16]; Solar radiation has an impact on phenolic
    compound biosynthesis [18]. A. Air Moisture and Temperature Crop is certainly
    a function of temperature if water is available for optimum satisfaction [1].
    Temperature has a great influence on seeds germination. Due to the biochemical
    processes, the germination phases that include hydration and enzyme activation,
    its degradation and embryo growth are temperature dependent. Validated arguments
    that show the necessity of temperature monitoring are: From 5 to 37 [ºC], the
    rate of photosynthesis is doubled at every 10 [ºC] increase in temperature; The
    respiration rate becomes double at each 10 °C above the optimum temperature; The
    minimum threshold is the temperature below which no growth is possible. Relative
    humidity offers an information regarding the water vapor that is in the air, this
    parameter being in a strong dependence with temperature. Dew point temperature
    explains this dependence, because temperature goes down when the relative humidity
    increases and if the temperature gets cold enough, the air gets to the point in
    which it holds the highest quantity of water vapors. Due to these arguments, air
    moisture and temperature must be monitored in an irrigation management system.
    B. Soil Moisture and Temperature Soil is also very important in irrigation management
    as it is a major source of atmospheric C O 2 and a storage reservoir for carbon
    with soil moisture being a driving force. Some advantages of soil moisture monitoring
    are: The influence in temperature and weather forecasting, due to the fact that
    it has an rise of the evaporation rate that increases the temperature [3]; The
    increasement of the humidity caused by the evaporation rate of the soil moisture
    that increases the dew point; The dependence between temperature and precipitation.
    This is highlighted by the low pressure systems that will condense if air moisture
    is due to the soil moisture evaporation. The result is precipitation occurrence.
    Irrigation management is of high importance in a vineyard. In many regions, growers
    apply irrigations when soil moisture is above an established limit (for example
    50%). Soil moisture is also important because it indirectly influences irrigation
    (the water application and movement across the field, assuring the intake rate).
    The application rate depends of sprinkler and low-volume methods such as deep
    and micro-sprinkles that uses mechanical devices as nozzles [5]. Water that is
    lost by evaporation could be saved by an efficient irrigation appliance capable
    of reducing evaporation with 5 to 15 % depending of the frequency that is used.
    Irrigation without soil moisture monitoring is not indicated, due to the fact
    that this parameter has an influence in the balance between canopy size and fruitfulness
    [19]. The main objective of irrigation is to optimize the plant water stress and
    this could be done by an efficient soil moisture monitoring. The readings of soil
    moisture sensor are temperature dependent and field measured resistance needs
    correction when some differences appear between calibration and field measurements.
    Soil temperature monitoring is influenced in an important proportion by solar
    radiation and humidity. It is considered that soil temperature should be measured
    by sensors that have no moving parts and that do not need calibration. C. Evapotranspiration
    A very important parameter for crop growth and health is evapotranspiration. This
    irrigation management variable is computed based on weather information (air temperature
    and humidity, wind speed etc.). Explanation of the interdependence existing among
    evapotranspiration and meteorological data collected from on-site weather stations
    is offered by using Penman-Monteith method [13]. E T 0 = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900

    View Source SECTION III. Control Strategies for Irrigation Systems Based on the
    monitoring of several parameters, as seen in chapter II, different control strategies
    and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency of irrigation systems.
    Different approaches can be used for designing the control strategy in drip irrigation
    systems: constant open-loop control, open loop on/off, feedback control, [23].
    A. Classical PID Control Classical control methods such as proportional, integral
    and derivative methods show good results, Fig. 1. Figure 1. Classical control
    system Show All In [21] a discrete PID controller is used to control an open irrigation
    channel. The actuator is the opening gate and the controller provides the signal
    for position of this gate. PID control is used in [22] in a modified manner, with
    a constrained integral function, and the goal is supplying the appropriate amount
    of water to meet the needs of the plant during the diurnal cycle. A diagram of
    the PID control for soil moisture in dripping irrigation system is presented in
    Fig. 2. The controller computes the command signal based on the error between
    the measured soil moisture from the transducer and the reference one. The actuator
    is represented by a control relay that acts on the water supply valve. Considering
    the varying solar radiation levels, the controller can still follow the soil moisture
    reference, which proved this classical method gives good results. Figure 2. Soil
    moisture PID control Show All B. Fuzzy Control Systems Fuzzy control is a strategy
    used for irrigation management considering several controlled parameters: soil
    moisture, water supply, loss minimization etc. The general architecture for fuzzy
    control of soil humidity is presented in [24], Fig. 3. The water supply is assured
    through a reservoir house height acts as actuating variable h . The soil moisture
    error is the difference between measured soil moisture and the reference one.
    The system has a variable reference depending on the stage of growth of the plant.
    Figure 3. Fuzzy control architecture Show All The soil humidity error''s membership
    function assignment, which is of high importance in fuzzy control, is based on
    the rule that the higher sensitivity membership for little error and the fine
    stability membership for larger error. Totally, there were 16 fuzzy rules in this
    system. C. Decision Support Systems In [6], a decision support system (DSS) is
    proposed for water supply prediction and control. This system collects data from
    a specific weather station. Then, collected data and weather predictions from
    three different sources are analyzed and the result is an evapotranspiration prediction
    and an estimation of plant daily development forecast for the next 10 days. A
    water distribution planning solution is proposed in [8] for irrigation in an arid
    district. Optimal water delivery scheduling for irrigation canals is implemented
    through a DSS system. The DSS structure consists of a water demand module, a supply
    module and a planning module, Fig. 4. Figure 4. DSS architecture for water supply
    scheduling, [8] Show All D. Model Predictive Control Model predictive control
    (MPC) approach is common used in industry offering a number of features: is robust
    against uncertainty system constraints can be handled is easy to accomplish tuning
    is used in multivariable control applications In MPC control strategy the future
    evolution control sequence of the system is determined based on system model by
    minimizing a cost function. The cost function is obtained by minimizing the deviation
    from set points over the prediction horizon, Fig. 5. Figure 5. MPC control Show
    All In [25] a Model Predictive Control framework for real-time irrigation scheduling
    is developed. A state space formulation of the water balance model is developed.
    The accuracy of the water balance approach is affected by uncertain measurements,
    such as evapotranspiration and precipitation and constraints such as limited water.
    The soil moisture deficit set-point tracking is accomplished by the MPC controller.
    The MPC controller also incorporates input and output constraints. The controller
    successfully tracks the commanded set-point as well as meets the constraints.
    SECTION IV. Proposed System for Irrigation Control in Vineyards Irrigation control
    strategies should be integrated in complex automation and telemetry systems. There
    are several such systems in the world, adapted on specific crops and weather.
    Two of the implemented irrigation management systems are presented further. The
    Advanced Scientific Irrigation Management application is a complex SCADA systems
    used for optimization irrigation in an arid district in USA, [6]. In order to
    implement the irrigation program, it is used a 6 six days sample code for each
    of the 369 parcels. Then, code is transferred to the SCADA master system which
    controls the 93 RTU stations by radio communications. Irrigation channels are
    controlled by a Decision Support System (DSS), as described in section III. Advantages
    of this system should be summarized as the overcome of water infiltrations, water
    costs, water-supply shortages, some specific irrigation issues. In [7] an implementation
    of an automated irrigation system, installed in Australia is presented. Efficiency
    of the irrigation system can be improved by an information infrastructure including
    sensors, actuators and supervisory control and data acquisition communication
    network. The task of the supervisory control is to ensure that the physical flow
    capacities are not exceeded. An irrigation system model is constructed based on
    the interconnection of the individual pool models. In order to achieve an entire
    irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real
    time on demand, the research and development effort has focused on controlling
    water quantity and quality in open channels. Due to knowledge and existing technologies
    in the third wave of the information processing, communication and computing,
    a new telemetry system for precision agriculture should be integrated into the
    Cyber-Physical System (CPS) concept. The CPS paradigm has two connotations. On
    the one hand, it solves the issues related to the way in which inquiry is done,
    whereas the second one is a model that underpins all specific states of the components
    of the process [4]. Considering the analysis on the control systems implemented
    over the world and the specific conditions in the Romanian context, an energy
    efficient irrigation system for water supply control in vineyards is proposed,
    Fig. 6. The irrigation management system for the precision agriculture could be
    seen as a MIMO system. The control strategy follows a fuzzy approach and it considers
    soil moisture control and the disturbances can be air temperature and evapotranspiration,
    as it is a plant disease indictor. Thus, the system must be fully interconnected
    and decentralized, being equipped with the following: One or more telemetry stations
    that establish the irrigation necessity. Considering the arguments exposed in
    the 2nd paragraph, it is of highly importance to have sensors for air and soil
    temperature, air and soil humidity and evapotranspiration computation, [26]. With
    these parameters, they could be calculated the precipitations necessity and the
    irrigations efficiency. A SCADA system (a SCADA master and clients) that receives
    all information from process and, using some specific decision algorithms, sends
    commands to actuators. It must be done a software application that collects and
    processes data from sensors and that has the capability of displaying it in a
    logical format. The main characteristics that a SCADA system for irrigation management
    must have are presented in Fig. 7. A RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) that includes
    solar panels and batteries for independent operation is used for acquisition of
    other field parameters and actuators control. The actuators consist of pumps,
    valves and other Figure 6. Proposed irrigation control system Show All Figure
    7. Main characteristics of the SCADA system in irrigation management Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusions Irrigation management systems should be focused on the
    adequate supply of water in order to increase crop productivity. This study focuses
    at first on the main parameters that must be monitored in an irrigation management
    system to discover the advantages and effects of their control. Both soil and
    air moisture and temperature are monitored with specific measurement probes and
    evapotranspiration can be calculated using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor or
    Makkink method. The control strategies for irrigation systems are classified into
    4 categories, from classical to new trends equipment that operate directly to
    irrigate the vineyards. All these are chosen for energy efficiency of the system,
    but also for efficient water management. in irrigation control: PID control, fuzzy
    control systems, decision support systems for water supply prediction and control
    and model predictive control. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal
    of an irrigation control system for vineyards, from a Cyber-Physical Systems perspective.
    The SCADA architecture allows a CPS approach and the fuzzy control strategy is
    suitable for the Romanian context. Based on the high quality of measurements,
    the system computes the water supply necessity based on a fuzzy controller. The
    communication system based on GSM modules at the field level brigs flexibility
    and ease of use for the telemetry and automation system. The system architecture
    has many other benefits such as low energy consumption, low administration costs
    and forecasting and diagnosis functions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

    Get rights and content Abstract Irrigation scheduling answers the question of
    when to irrigate and how much. The techniques used for scheduling include the
    monitoring of soil moisture, physiological indicators and water balance models.
    The areas of major concern are: (a) a soil moisture sensor which is inexpensive,
    rapid and accurate; (b) a means of assessing the upper and lower limits of soil
    water content in the changing root zone; (c) development of a rapid technique
    for estimating leaf area; and (d) a means of measuring canopy transpiration. A
    major research thrust that can be identified is the separation of evaporation
    from the soil surface and transpiration by the canopy. As one manipulates the
    canopy geometry to assess the cultural practices and irrigation systems, the need
    to clearly identify the contribution of evaporation and transpiration becomes
    increasingly important. The objective for irrigation for the farmer is to maximize
    his net returns. There are three components of an economic model for determining
    that decision: (a) a water balance; (b) a growth response function; and (c) an
    economic optimization function. A few of the problem areas in such a scheme are:
    (a) adaptation by the plant to water stress; (b) dynamics of the root system;
    (c) interaction between fertility and water; and (d) risk analysis. References

    \ of water deﬁcit in ﬁeld conditions, researchers or breeders\nmust set up large\
    \ experiment networks in very restrictive ﬁeld environments. Experience\nshows\
    \ that half of the ﬁeld trials are not relevant because of climatic conditions\
    \ that do\nnot allow the stress scenario to be tested. The PhénoField\nR⃝ platform\
    \ is the ﬁrst ﬁeld\nbased infrastructure in the European Union to ensure protection\
    \ against rainfall for a\nlarge number of plots, coupled with the non-invasive\
    \ acquisition of crops’ phenotype. In\nthis paper, we will highlight the PhénoField\n\
    R⃝ production capability using data from 2017-\nwheat trial. The innovative approach\
    \ of the PhénoField\nR⃝ platform consists in the use of\nautomatic irrigating\
    \ rainout shelters coupled with high throughput ﬁeld phenotyping to\ncomplete\
    \ conventional phenotyping and micrometeorological densiﬁed measurements.\nFirstly,\
    \ to test various abiotic stresses, automatic mobile rainout shelters allow ﬁne\n\
    management of fertilization or irrigation by driving daily the intensity and period\
    \ of the\napplication of the desired limiting factor on the evaluated crop. This\
    \ management is\nbased on micro-meteorological measurements coupled with a simulation\
    \ of a carbon,\nwater and nitrogen crop budget. Furthermore, as high-throughput\
    \ plant-phenotyping\nunder controlled conditions is well advanced, comparable\
    \ evaluation in ﬁeld conditions\nis enabled through phenotyping gantries equipped\
    \ with various optical sensors. This\napproach, giving access to either similar\
    \ or innovative variables compared manual\nmeasurements, is moreover distinguished\
    \ by its capacity for dynamic analysis. Thus,\nthe interactions between genotypes\
    \ and the environment can be deciphered and better\ndetailed since this gives\
    \ access not only to the environmental data but also to plant\nresponses to limiting\
    \ hydric and nitrogen conditions. Further data analyses provide\naccess to the\
    \ curve parameters of various indicator kinetics, all the more integrative\nand\

    \ HTP Platform\nINTRODUCTION\nThe last three decades have witnessed a decline\
    \ in the growth\nof yield trends (AGRESTE, 2018) which has been attributed to\n\
    climate change rather than to breeding or agronomical causes\n(Brisson et al.,\
    \ 2010). Climate changes are in general unfavorable\nto cereal yields in temperate\
    \ climates because of higher heat stress\nduring grain ﬁlling and longer drought\
    \ during stem elongation.\nRegional model simulations for climate change in mid-Europe\n\
    agree on an occurrence of higher variability in rainfall in the\ncoming decades,\
    \ with an increased risk of water shortage during\nsummers (Jacob et al., 2013).\
    \ At the same time, water resources\navailable for agricultural irrigation will\
    \ be reduced or maintained\nin the best scenarios (Barros et al., 2014). Moreover,\
    \ the crucial\nrole of nitrogen on production and quality of the harvested\norgans\
    \ (Jensen et al., 2011) coupled with the potential impact of\nnitrogen losses\
    \ on the environment (Galloway et al., 2003; Sutton\net al., 2011) lead to an\
    \ increasing concern about the improvement\nof the nitrogen use eﬃciency of the\
    \ agricultural systems. This\nperspective enforces the need to design strategies\
    \ and tools that\ncombine novel crop genotypes and adapted crop management\ntechniques\
    \ to assist agriculture in facing major challenges, such\nas increasing rainfall\
    \ variability and the reduced availability of\nfertilizers (Wreford et al., 2010).\n\
    While genomic capacity encountered a breakthrough in\n2010, phenotyping capacity\
    \ has become the major limitation in\nbreeding programs aimed at building genotypes\
    \ that maintain\nor increase crop performance under climate changes and\nreduced\
    \ inputs (Furbank and Tester, 2011). In ﬁeld conditions,\nconventional phenotyping\
    \ represents high investment, it is\nlaborious, mainly destructive, and could\
    \ weaken signiﬁcance or\nprecision of results from consolidated large experimental\
    \ reliant\nnetworks. Numerous measurements on a broad genetic diversity\npanel\
    \ are now perceived as key levers of genetic advances and\nlessen the potential\
    \ added value of modern techniques such as\nmarker-assisted selection, or genomic\
    \ selection (Araus et al.,\n2018). To address this issue, signiﬁcant eﬀorts have\
    \ been made to\nencourage the capacities of multilevel phenotyping in worldwide\n\
    initiatives and dynamics, creating networks and communities.\nThe acceleration\
    \ of instrumentation (Reynolds et al., 2018;\nRoitsch et al., 2019) and sampling\
    \ capacities (Pieruschka and\nSchurr, 2019) has opened the way for further investigation\
    \ in\nepigenetic mechanisms and plant physiology with the possibility\nof building\
    \ advanced digital models of plant physiology which\nunderpin research and decision\
    \ support services (Jiang et al.,\n2018; Tardieu et al., 2018; van Eeuwijk et\
    \ al., 2018).\nThe French Plant Phenotyping Network1, PHENOME-\nEMPHASIS/France,\
    \ funded by the French National Research\nAgency (ANR), and lead by the National\
    \ Institute of Agricultural\nResearch (INRA), provides French researchers with\
    \ up-to-\ndate, high throughput infrastructures and methods allowing the\ncharacterization\
    \ of diﬀerent species under scenarios associated\nwith climate change. The project\
    \ aims (i) to build and upgrade\nhighly instrumented platforms in nine French\
    \ sites able as a\nwhole to grow the most common crop species under a large\n\

    \ develop new sensing\ntechnologies, associated with advanced data processing\
    \ and\nmanagement, (iii) to disseminate the newly developed techniques\nand methods\

    \ AND METHODS\nDEVELOPED ON THE PHÉNOFIELD\nR⃝\nPLATFORM\nThe\nPhénoField\nR⃝\n\
    platform\nis\nlocated\nat\nOuzouer-le-\nMarché/Beauce la Romaine (41) in Beauce\
    \ region, one of\nFrance’s most productive agricultural areas hosting a wide variety\n\
    of cultivated crops (Figure 1). It was implemented in 2013\non 7.5 hectares of\
    \ farmland and is equipped with 8 moving\nrainout shelters, environmental sensors\
    \ and high throughput\nphenotyping facilities. A web-based user interface, named\
    \ PhenX\n(Piquemal, 2017), allows data visualization and downloading.\nManaged\
    \ Environment\nMobile Rainout Shelters\nEach rainout shelter covers 655 m2 (about\
    \ 25 m × 25 m), and\nis equipped with an automaton controlling its movement. The\n\
    central controller is linked to a rain contact sensor and sonic\nanemometer to,\
    \ respectively, trigger the movement of the rainout\nshelters and secure the infrastructure\
    \ (in case of strong wind).\nEach of the 8 rainout shelters is seated on three\
    \ 150 m-long\nrails in order to move them from a garage position (when it\ndoes\
    \ not rain Figure 2A) to a rain controlled position (when\nraining Figure 2B).\
    \ The rainout shelters are arranged along 4\ncropping areas to ensure adequate\
    \ crop rotation every year with,\ngenerally, 2 cropping areas with the trial crop\
    \ (Nos. 3 and 4,\nFigure 2) and the 2 others with an “erasure crop” (Nos. 1 and\
    \ 2,\nFigure 2) including one area for park position. This experimental\ndesign\
    \ allows ﬁrstly, the rainout shelter to be stationed at 43 m\nfurther than the\
    \ trial area, thus avoiding the drop shadow during\nnon-rainy periods and secondly,\
    \ the rain- controlled position to\noperate in the same area every 4 years. To\
    \ maintain this eﬃcient\ncrop rotation, the erasure crop must be chosen according\
    \ to the\nspecies studied. Field trial species on PhénoField\nR⃝ are therefore\n\
    discussed nearly 18 months before trial implementation.\nThe 8 rainout shelters\
    \ protect 384 m × 6 m ﬁeld trial\nmicroplots (1 m × 6 m; Figure 1-rigth part).\
    \ Each shelter, formed\nby 2 spans, manages 48 microplots with experimental modalities\n\
    applied per group of 24 microplots at span scale. For crop\nmanagement, PhénoField\n\
    R⃝ is equipped with a special spray boom\nto treat one span from the central aisle\
    \ between rainout shelters\nand so avoid aﬀecting soil compaction with machinery\
    \ under\nrainout shelters. Thus, nitrogen or crop protection cross-factors\nare\
    \ set up at span scale.\nThe eight rainout shelters are equipped with their own\n\
    individual irrigation networks, allowing precise management\nof the water supply\
    \ in protected plots. Two booms per\nrainout shelter allow up to 16 diﬀerent irrigation\
    \ modalities.\nHence PhénoField\nR⃝ can perform between 1 controlled irrigation\n\
    modality on 384 microplots to up to 16 modalities of 24\nmicroplots. Using the\
    \ rainfall area (when rainout shelter parking\nis on area no. 1 or no. 4), PhénoField\n\
    R⃝ allows a 768-\nmicroplot ﬁeld trial. Roof gutters collect the rain water used\

    \ This whole infrastructure allows crops to be subjected\nto a pre-determined\
    \ duration of water stress at any desired\nperiod of their cycle.\nSoil Characterization\n\
    The management of crop water stress implies precise soil\ncharacterization\nestablished\n\
    with\nmeasurements\nof\nsoil\nresistivity and water holding capacity (WHC) on\
    \ the entire\nPhénoField\nR⃝ platform.\nThe electrical resistivity of the soil\
    \ is a physical quantity related\nto the soil’s intrinsic characteristics (clay\
    \ content, texture, water\ncontent, depth, etc.), with the higher values representing\
    \ soil\nresistance to current ﬂow. This magnitude of soil resistivity is\nmeasurable\
    \ at high resolution and allows, for some types of soil,\nto extrapolate geographically\
    \ located measures of water holding\ncapacity (Michot et al., 2003). Soil resistivity\
    \ measurements were\nperformed by using the Automatic Resistivity Proﬁling (ARP)\n\
    method which uses a multi-electrode system towed by a quad bike\nfor rapid data\
    \ acquisition (Dabas, 2008). One pair of electrodes\nwas used for electric current\
    \ injection and 3 pairs were employed\nfor measurements in order to investigate\
    \ the soil resistivity\nbetween 0–50, 0–100, and 0–200 cm. ARP measurements were\n\
    performed in September 2011 over the entire farmland to acquire\nsoil-resistivity\
    \ data used to get a global view of the agricultural\nplot and optimize rainout\
    \ shelter locations on the farmland.\nThe soil observed on the agricultural ﬁeld\
    \ is Beauce clay loam\nwith a loamy clay texture on calcareous Beauce rock. Samples\n\
    have been taken to determine the WHC/cm of the diﬀerent types\nof soil layers\
    \ based on granulometric analyses. Spatialization\nof soil layer thicknesses was\
    \ performed at the beginning of\nplatform construction by using the 1,100 pits\
    \ opened for pouring\nconcrete pads, from 0 to 1.5 m for each pit. In more detail,\
    \ we\nmeasured four kinds of soil thicknesses: LA which corresponds\nto plowed\
    \ horizon, S which is cambic horizon, C1 and C2 which\ncorrespond to calcaric\
    \ material (C1 is cryoturbed limestone and\nC2 is sandy calcaric material). Based\
    \ on these data combined\nwith pF data for each horizons characterized, soil mapping\
    \ was\ngenerated with krigeage models providing soil layer thicknesses\nbut also\
    \ WHC estimation at every point of the platform. As\nmicroplots are georeferenced,\
    \ an estimation of the WHC was\nperformed for each of them by computing the mean\
    \ of the WHC\npoints contained in the corresponding area. Data management\nwas\
    \ operated by PostgreSQL software, a relational database\nmanagement system extended\
    \ with PostGIS software to add\nsupport for geographic objects.\nPhénoField\n\
    R⃝ Rainout Shelter Efﬁciency\nCharacterization\nEvaluation of the shelters’ capacity\
    \ to eﬃciently intercept rainfall\nwas evaluated in 2017 by measuring precipitation\
    \ along transects\nof crops protected by the shelters. Seven pluviometers were\n\
    installed at equivalent distances (6 m) with ﬁve installed under\nthe area protected\
    \ by rainout shelters and two others installed\non each side of this protected\
    \ area. Pluviometers were positioned\nbetween each microplot-line.\nPossible side\
    \ eﬀects on photosynthetically active radiation\n(PAR) and temperature were also\
    \ assessed in 2017 by using,\nrespectively, two quantum sensors (SKP215, Campbell\
    \ Scientiﬁc)\nand two thermocouples (T109, Campbell Scientiﬁc). One of each\n\
    sensor was set up in the center of the area protected from rain\nand the other\
    \ one outside the protected area. Comparisons of\nair temperature and PAR inside\
    \ and outside the shelter-protected\narea were performed by measuring the cumulative\
    \ PAR and\ndegree-day over the period of crop protection. The cumulative\ndaily\
    \ light was calculated as the sum of PAR received each day\nby the crop (in µmol.m−2)\
    \ and the cumulative degree-day as the\nmean of maximum and minimum daily temperatures\

    \ at 30, 60, and 90 cm deep are recorded in control\nplots under each rainout\
    \ shelter.\nIrrigation management was realized using Irrinov\nR⃝ method\n(Bouthier\
    \ et al., 2003). Irrinov\nR⃝ is an online free irrigation\ntool based on tensiometer\
    \ measurements3. It gives tension\nthresholds above which farmers have to irrigate\
    \ for Watermark\nR⃝\ntensiometers at 30 and 60 cm deep in a given situation (3\n\
    tensiometers are placed at each depth). This method has been\ndeveloped by Arvalis\
    \ and its partners for diﬀerent regions in\nFrance. Thresholds depend on four\
    \ main variables: climatic\ndemand, soil type, crop and period between two irrigations\n\
    (parameter which depends on farmer irrigation equipment). It\nis made for farmers\
    \ to manage irrigation in its tactic phase.\nThresholds were determined with ﬁeld\
    \ trials in diﬀerent French\nregions. For PhénoField\nR⃝, we chose Irrinov\nR⃝\
    \ method adapted to\nFrench region Centre, for a deep soil and for wheat. In these\n\
    conditions, 30 cm-tensiometer threshold is 100 cbar and 60 cm\nthreshold is 80\
    \ cbar before last leaf spread growth stage (Z39)\nand 100 cbar after. To manage\
    \ well-watered irrigation during the\nBREEDWHEAT trial, we decreased thresholds\
    \ to bring water in\nthe ﬁeld to 80 cbar also after Z39 to be sure plants do not\
    \ suﬀer\nfrom water stress in well-watered conditions (WW). This method\nallowed\
    \ us to consider that under 120 cbar threshold at 60 cm\nwheat is not suﬀering\
    \ from water stress. Unfortunately, this kind\nof probe cannot record signal higher\
    \ than 200 cbar and they don’t\nmeasure soil humidity directly.\nIt was therefore\
    \ necessary to have other kind of sensors to\nmeasure soil humidity. To do that,\
    \ soil humidity was measured\nwith Time Domain Reﬂectometry probes (TDR-TRIME-PICO\n\
    64) installed at 30, 60, and 90 cm deep in control plots under\neach shelter.\
    \ This type of probe has the advantage of being\nburied for 5–10 years without\
    \ being moved. To position them\ndeep in the soil it was necessary to make small\
    \ trenches and\nTDR probes are known to be very sensitive to their immediate\n\
    environment (air, ground contact with the pins, pebbles, etc.) so\nthey must have\
    \ been calibrated with a series of ﬁve gravimetric\nmeasurements performed every\
    \ 2 months. Gravimetric water\ncontent was determined by measuring the weight\
    \ of freshly\ncollected soil (near each probe) and a soil sample oven-dried at\n\
    110◦C over 48 h (see Supplementary Figure S1).\nIn addition to measurements by\
    \ the probes on control plots,\nsoil nitrogen content was measured following a\
    \ colorimetric\nmethod using a KCL extraction on samples taken before sowing,\n\
    at the end of winter and after harvesting.\nCHN: A Model to Quantify Abiotic Limiting\
    \ Factors\nAgro-meteorological conditions are incorporated into a dynamic\ncrop\
    \ model (called ‘CHN’) used to estimate crop growth,\nmanage crop practices and\
    \ evaluate crop responses to water and\nnitrogen shortage (Soenen et al., 2016).\
    \ This model calculates\nthe daily ﬂow of carbon (C), water (H), and nitrogen\
    \ (N)\nbetween the soil, atmosphere and plant compartments at a\ndaily time stage\
    \ during a cropping season (see Supplementary\n3http://www.irrinov.arvalisinstitutduvegetal.fr/irrinov.asp\n\
    Figure S2). Soil and Atmosphere compartments are connected\nto databases using,\
    \ respectively, diﬀerent soil characteristics in\nFrance and daily weather data\
    \ (over 250 sites with 25 years data;\nSoenen et al., 2016). The plant compartment\
    \ is based on the\nMonteith approach (Monteith, 1994): leaf growth is modeled\n\
    and intercepts radiation that is converted into biomass. The\nGreen Plant Area\
    \ Index (GPAI), transpiration and biomass are\naﬀected by water and nitrogen deﬁciency,\
    \ according to functions\nof stress response developed by Sinclair (Sinclair,\
    \ 1986). These\nfunctions provide a stress factor between 1 (minimum stress)\n\
    and 0 (maximum stress), that is used to slow down the potential\ngrowth and transpiration.\
    \ Links between soil–plant–atmosphere\ncompartments are the background of a model\
    \ of the water and\nnitrogen balance. Coupled with frequentist weather forecasts,\n\
    CHN outputs are complementary to probe measurements for\nwater and nitrogen input\
    \ management to follow-up the situation\nof each shelter line each day.\nTrial\
    \ From the BREEDWHEAT Project\nIn 2016–2017, a bread winter wheat ﬁeld trial was\
    \ conducted\nfor the BREEDWHEAT project. It aimed to evaluate 22\nvarieties, mutual\
    \ to other ﬁeld experiments and known for their\ndiversity of responses to diﬀerent\
    \ stresses, especially diﬀering\nin behavior to nitrogen- and water-stressed conditions.\
    \ Using\nsix of the eight rainout shelters from PhénoField\nR⃝, it was\nimplemented\
    \ with a double split-plot design in order to group\nwater management treatments\
    \ under rainout shelters and two\nnitrogen fertilization levels per rainout shelter\
    \ (one per span) (see\nSupplementary Table S1).\nThe two water management treatments\
    \ consisted of:\n1. Well Water conditions (called “WW”) without rain\ninterception\
    \ and good irrigation practices (following the\nIRRINOV\nR⃝ method and CHN model).\n\
    2. Water Deﬁcient conditions (called “WD”) with the\ninterception of rainfall\
    \ in the period between the ﬁrst node\nand grain ﬁlling growth stages (from 22nd\
    \ February to the\n25th June) and irrigation occurring only to allow nitrogen\n\
    uptake from fertilizer.\nEach water management treatments was applied to 3 shelters\n\
    and separated per span so as to have two nitrogen levels:\n1. With optimum nitrogen\
    \ supply (receiving a total 132 kg\nN.ha−1, called “N+”).\n2. Without N supply\
    \ (called ‘N0’).\nThe 22 bread winter wheat varieties were randomized\nunder each\

    \ Data\nPhenotyping Gantry and Sensor Bay\nA set of eight fully automated phenotyping\
    \ gantries were installed\nover the moving rainout shelter rails in order to acquire\
    \ frequent\ncrop canopy measurements via remote sensors, thus ensuring\nnon-invasive\
    \ measurements and the collection of a large amount\nof phenotyping data. Each\
    \ 25 m wide gantry is able to lift\na payload at a 6 m height, allowing data acquisition\
    \ on any\ntype of crop, even tall maize cultivars. These data are obtained\nwith\
    \ the sensors installed on a high throughput phenotyping\nbay, mounted on the\
    \ gantries during experimental campaigns. It\nallows smoothed screening from 0.1\
    \ to 3 m.s−1 and centimetric\ncontrolled repositioning of canopy sizing from 0\
    \ to 3 m. Each\nsensor head can carry a set of sensors with no limit of power\n\
    consumption and up to 150 kg. New sensor installation is possible\nthanks to its\
    \ payload capacity and its agile interfacing. An open\nrobotic operating system\
    \ (ROS; Quigley et al., 2009) was used\nto allow interfacing of several sensors\
    \ and the management of\nspatial and temporal sampling on each microplot.\nTwo\
    \ identical phenotyping bays are currently used on the 8\ngantries to carry several\
    \ types of optical sensors. The position\nof the sensors was optimized in order\
    \ to spatially sample the\narea of interest and allow intra-plot borders removal.\
    \ Each\nsensor bay had 2 measuring viewpoints: an optical head at the\nvertical\

    \ and to\ncalculate physical units of reﬂectance. Acquisition was optimized\n\
    to maximize the sampling within the microplot and to allow\nfull acquisition of\
    \ the platform in 1 day with a two-sensors bay.\nDuring the 2017 campaign an operation\
    \ speed of 0.3 m.s−1\nwas chosen allowing three acquisitions of each RGB image\
    \ and\nof VIS-NIR reﬂectance measurements. LiDAR acquisition was\ncarried out\
    \ all over the plot area.\nProcessing and Interpretation\nFor RGB cameras, a white\
    \ balance process was ﬁrst applied to\nadjust intensities of the red, green, and\
    \ blue channels at a same\nintensity on a reference gray panel. This standardization\
    \ was\nimportant for a robust color based image analysis.\nThe ﬁrst use a RGB\
    \ images was the calculation of the green\ncover fractions (GCF) at 0◦ and 45◦.\
    \ A support vector machine\nalgorithm trained on a reference dataset, was used\
    \ to classify\nfor each image the green and non-green pixels and determine\nthe\
    \ percentage of green elements for a given viewing angle\n(Dutartre et al., 2015).\n\
    The green cover fractions at 0◦ and 45◦ were used to estimate\nthe Green Area\
    \ Index (GAI) and Average Leaf Angle (ALA). Both\nvariables were estimated by\
    \ inverting a simple Poisson model\nusing the measured gap fractions Po, calculated\
    \ as (1-GCF). The\nmodel used to relate Po to GAI is:\nPo\n\0θp\n\x01\n= e\n−\
    \ G(θp,θl)\ncos(θp) . GAI\nWhere θp is the viewing angle, θl is the mean leaf\
    \ angle and\nG(θp,θl) is the function that expresses the projected area of the\n\
    leaves for a particular conﬁguration. We assumed that the G\nfunction follows\
    \ an ellipsoidal leaf angle distribution (Campbell,\n1986, 1990). The model was\
    \ inverted using a look up table\nminimization procedure (Weiss et al., 2000,\
    \ 2004) to retrieve the\nmore likely combination of GAI and ALA.\nFor spectroradiometers,\
    \ a calibration measurement on a\nspectrally characterized reference surface was\
    \ done before each\ndata acquisition session. The reﬂectance at the crop level\n\
    was then obtained by dividing the canopy reﬂectance by the\ncalibration measurement.\
    \ At the plot level, the averages of\nthe normalized reﬂectances were computed.spectroradiometer\n\
    Satisfactory signal to noise ratio (giving a threshold of 20) ranges\nfrom 450\
    \ to 820 nm. Then physically expressed reﬂectance was\nsampled by Gaussian ﬁlters\
    \ corresponding to bands needed for\ncalculation of the vegetation indexes. Three\
    \ vegetation indexes\nfrom remote sensing literature were selected for their asserted\n\
    link with diﬀerent phenological aspects of the aerial part of\nmonitored crop.\
    \ The vegetation indices calculations were made\nwith a 3 nm Full Width Half Maximum\
    \ (FWHM) for all bands.\nThe Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI; initially\n\
    proposed by Rouse et al., 1974) is a basic and robust indicator\nof the amount\
    \ of vegetation in the ﬁeld. It correlates ﬁrstly with\nthe cover fraction in\
    \ the direction of sight and secondly with GAI.\nNDVI = R800 − R670\nR800 + R\

    \ by Dash and Curran (2004) in order to extend\nthe accuracy of red-edge position\
    \ estimation on crops with\nhigher chlorophyll content. Initially designed to\
    \ exploit Medium\nResolution Imaging Spectrometer built into the platform, it\n\
    showed a better capacity than other red-edge based indexes to\nestimate chlorophyll\

    \ modeling in\norder to minimize the eﬀect of leaf chlorophyll content on the\n\

    \ to variety behavior, both water and nitrogen\ndeﬁciency signiﬁcantly reduced\
    \ the yield (Figure 10A). The\nWHC was ﬁlled at the end of February. Up until\
    \ the end of\nMarch (Z30 stage), this 184 mm of water allowed crop growing\nin\

    \ 11.4 t.ha−1 in WW\nN+ conditions to 8 t.ha−1 in WD N+ condition. This water\n\
    deﬁcit was rather strong and resulted in a 30% decrease in yield.\nAlong the same\

    \ on other crops.\nMapping soil characterization is important to understand soil\n\
    heterogeneity in order to take it into account in the interpretation\nof agronomic\
    \ variables (Di Virgilio et al., 2007). The WHC map\nshowed signiﬁcant variability\
    \ typical of the soil of this region.\nIndeed, the clay-silt soils developed on\
    \ Beauce limestone have a\nvariability of thickness within very short distances\
    \ (sometimes\nmetric, Seger et al., 2017). It is important to consider this\n\
    variability during crop management because crops growing on\nlimited WHC are more\
    \ subject to drought and will probably\nrequire more irrigation. The simultaneous\
    \ use of the WHC\nmap, the CHN model, tensiometers and TDR probes allows\nmonitoring\
    \ and control of limiting factors applied to the crops.\nHowever, work should\
    \ be carried out to characterize root depth\nin order to reﬁne the map of the\
    \ WHC, and so deﬁne a map of\nthe water accessible to the plant. The ultimate\
    \ goal is to access to\nmicroplot scale data to characterize crop water consumption\
    \ for\neach microplot tested on PhénoField\nR⃝.\nHigh Throughput Phenotyping to\n\
    Characterize Drought and Nitrogen\nStress Impact\nPhénoField\nR⃝ uses high throughput\
    \ ﬁeld based phenotyping\ndevelopment to characterize responses of crop to abiotic\
    \ stresses.\nThe example of the BREEDWHEAT ﬁeld trial conducted in 2017\ndemonstrated\
    \ the capacity of the system to characterize drought\nand nitrogen stress impact\
    \ on wheat growth, with accuracy\nneeded to diﬀerentiate treatments like wheat\
    \ varieties.\nIn this trial, water and nitrogen deﬁciency have diﬀerent\nimpact\
    \ on agronomical traits but we have a signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerence\nbetween\nvarieties\n\
    on\nall\nagronomical\ntraits\n(Supplementary Table S2).\nIn our case, the application\
    \ of drought during the stem\nelongation period (Figure 8) negatively aﬀected\
    \ the yield of the\nwheat (Figure 10). Drought continued to severely aﬀect yield\n\
    during grain-ﬁlling, inducing earlier green fraction decreasing\nthat could be\
    \ considered as an indicator of earlier leaf senescence\n(Figure 12). Drought\
    \ also leads to a signiﬁcant reduction\nin the thousand kernel weight (Figure\
    \ 10). Such results are\noften reported and well described in literature (e.g.,\
    \ Estrada-\nCampuzano et al., 2008) with eﬀects depending on the stress\nintensity\
    \ and on the plant-growth stage at the time of application\n(Fahad et al., 2017).\
    \ In the same way, induction of nitrogen\ndeﬁciency led to a reduction in the\
    \ yield compared to the\noptimum nitrogen conditions (at WW conditions). It is\
    \ also\nconsistent with literature relating the yield loss to a diminution\nof\
    \ ear density (e.g., Le Gouis et al., 2000). The performance of\ndiﬀerent bread\
    \ wheat varieties for yield and yield components\nvaried and could be relatively\
    \ contrasted in similar conditions.\nIndeed, it should be interesting for variety\
    \ characterization to\nobserve the impact of these diﬀerences on grain yield.\n\
    Diﬀerences linked to stress conditions were also noticed\nwith the embedded sensors\
    \ LIDARs, RGB cameras and\nspectroradiometers. First of all, these sensors provided\
    \ temporal\ninformation on wheat varieties and crop management systems.\nThe height\
    \ calculated with the LIDARs could be a good\nindicator of the onset and magnitude\
    \ of the plant’s stress\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org\n14\n\

    \ Platform\n(Madec et al., 2017) but also of the date of the starting\npoint of\
    \ stress impact. Similarly, the RGB cameras enable\nestimations of the GF (Figure\
    \ 12) and GPAI (Figure 11B).\nThe GPAI has been reported to be a relevant variable\
    \ for\nseveral key processes involved in canopy functioning (Baret\net al., 2010),\
    \ especially the stay-green of the LAI which\nparticipates in biomass accumulation.\
    \ It is acknowledged that\nwheat genotypes that sustain ﬂag-leaf photosynthesis\
    \ for longer\nperiods produce better yields (Christopher et al., 2008); therefore,\n\
    the start and rate of senescence of ﬂag leaves in wheat can\nbe used as an indicator\
    \ of stress resistance for determining\nresistance to stress (Larbi and Mekliche,\
    \ 2004). PhénoField\nR⃝\nsensors and the actual processing data are not allowing\
    \ us\nto look at ﬂag leaf alone but rather the plot canopy. Here,\nnitrogen deﬁciency\
    \ had a negative eﬀect earlier than drought\nas shown on GPAI (Figure 11B) but\
    \ also on plant height\n(Figure 11A). Strangely, at early stage (end of winter),\
    \ the WD\nmodality had a GPAI higher than that of the WW modality\n(Figure 11B).\
    \ A lack of nitrogen probably link to irrigation\non WW and a loss due to nitrogen\
    \ leaching could explain the\neﬀect on GPAI of the latter modality. The spectroradiometer\n\
    data are currently used to extract common vegetation indexes\n(as NDVI, MCARI2,\
    \ or MTCI). These vegetation indexes\nare complementary and used diﬀerently depending\
    \ on the\nphenological stage. They can be related to yield components\nand nitrogen\
    \ content (Dash and Curran, 2004; Walsh et al.,\n2018) as it was reported here\
    \ with the correlation between\nthe MTCI AUC and the nitrogen grain yield (Figure\
    \ 13).\nSuch indexes could, as the MTCI, discriminate the response\nof wheat varieties\
    \ to stress and so, explain varietal behaviors\n(Basso et al., 2016).\nIn addition\
    \ to temporal analyses, curves parameters whether\nthey are directly read on a\
    \ drawn curve direct or calculated from\na ﬁtted curve, could also be an alternative\
    \ way of analyzing data\nin high throughput phenotyping systems. Nevertheless,\
    \ stress\nindicators such as areas under the curve shown previously,\nappear to\
    \ be more relevant than using point values to explain\nperformance from high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping data.\nIt seems that these variables that describe the behaviors\n\
    of varieties will enrich breeding methodologies in order to\naccelerate genetic\
    \ progress especially given the predictions\nthat climate change will bring about\
    \ more drought and heat\nstress in the majority of wheat environments (Barros\
    \ et al.,\n2014). High throughput phenotyping (HTP) is particularly\nfast compared\
    \ to manual measurements and provides a non-\ndestructive method for accessing\
    \ physiological and biochemical\ntrait responses to environmental conditions (Araus\
    \ et al.,\n2018) at each development stage. The development of the\nHTP system\
    \ has originally focused on measurements of large\nnumbers of plants in controlled\
    \ environments. This approach\nprovided advanced knowledge of the plants’ physiological\n\
    processes. Nonetheless, studying plant responses in controlled\nenvironments representing\
    \ ﬁeld environments has well-known\nlimitations (White et al., 2012). So, developing\
    \ a ﬁeld platform\nlike the PhénoField\nR⃝ platform represents a novel type of\
    \ tool\ndedicated to assess the responses of crops to stress scenarios by\nusing\
    \ the HTP techniques in the ﬁeld.\nCONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\nAs shown with 2017\
    \ dataset, the automated movement of the\n8 rainout shelters demonstrated its\
    \ performance to control\nwater and nitrogen deﬁciency on bread winter wheat ﬁeld\n\
    trials without other signiﬁcant impact on the trial environment.\nThis data set\
    \ is limited on genotype number to perform 3\nreplicates and 4 stress conditions.\
    \ PhénoField\nR⃝ platform, with\nits large plot capacity, could also provide genetics’\
    \ ﬁeld trials\nwith more than 300 genotypes under sole drought conditions\nand\
    \ enhance knowledge on physiological analyses, varieties\ntolerance evaluation\
    \ or genomic regions controlling these\ncomplex traits. 2017 was the 1st year\
    \ using ﬁeld HTP with a\ndata-processing pipeline that still has to be improved.\
    \ However,\nit showed promising results, especially with the dynamics of\nsensor\
    \ traits allowing the calculation of relevant indicators of\nabiotic stresses.\n\
    The actual set of sensors allows testing of many traits\nand new parameters to\
    \ select the best way to discriminate\nmodalities as varieties under nitrogen\
    \ or water deﬁciency. The\npossibilities to analyze the 2017 data set are really\
    \ important\nand we are aware that only a small part was explored in\nthis paper.\
    \ Nevertheless, our ﬁrst objective was to demonstrate\nthe PhénoField\nR⃝ platform’s\
    \ capacity to eﬃciently conduct the\ntest protocols (intensity and duration of\
    \ stress). Conducting\ntrials on ﬁeld HTP induced signiﬁcant soil environment\n\
    genotype interactions and, mapping the spatial variation of soil\ncharacteristics\
    \ (as well as WHC soil resistivity) is essential for\nincorporating ﬁeld variability\
    \ into crop management and for\nthe interpretation of experimental results. Acquisition\
    \ of ﬁeld\nphenotyping data is now a well-established process, allowing\nweekly\
    \ data registration from spectroradiometers, LiDARs and\nRGB cameras. Acquisition\
    \ of measurements for the entire\nplatform amounts to about 100 GB per day and\
    \ only a minor\npart of it is used to calculate the height, GPAI or vegetation\n\
    index presented here. In future publications, we will explore\nmore in details\
    \ curve parameters in regards to agronomic\ndata. Moreover, since 2018, the inversion\
    \ of radiative models\navailable in PhénoField\nR⃝ data processing chain allows\
    \ access\nto the chlorophyll content, which is even more relevant than\nthe vegetation\
    \ indexes in qualifying nitrogen stresses. Indeed,\nthe calculation of the commonly\
    \ used vegetation indexes\nonly used 1% of the available spectra and exploitation\
    \ of\nother wavelengths could highlight other physiological processes\n(Araus\
    \ et al., 2018).\nPhénoField\nR⃝ is also a platform acting as a ﬁeld HTP\nreference\
    \ used to calibrate and develop innovative phenotyping\ntools such as the set-up\
    \ of new sensors. Thus, measurements\nby drones can be compared to the acquisition\
    \ of gantries.\nDrones\nwill\nallow\ncomplementary\nsampling\nto\nintercept\n\
    diurnal\nvariation\nand\ndata\nacquisition\nfaster\nthan\nwith\nembedded\nsensors\n\

    Abstract The overall purpose of this work was to show that by measuring the complex
    permittivity of soil, feedback signals can be achieved for both water and fertiliser
    input. It is well known that the real part of soil permittivity is closely connected
    to the volumetric water content. So sensors based on this principle are available
    for controlling irrigation. For controlling fertilisation, a newer development
    is the assessment of the pore water conductivity by measuring also the imaginary
    part of the soil permittivity. Washout experiments have shown that this ‘salinity’
    (the pore water conductivity, based on the ion concentration in the plant available
    water) is mostly influenced by nitrate ions under agricultural circumstances.
    Lysimeter experiments with rape demonstrated that by measuring the complex permittivity,
    the actual amount of salts available to the crop could be mapped quite clearly,
    when the salinity measurements were corrected to salinity values at constant soil
    moisture (here: to values at field capacity). In conclusion, it is shown that
    a controlled fertilisation can be as straightforward as controlling irrigation.
    The only difference is the much greater time constant. Previous article in issue

    1. Purpose and approach Water and fertiliser are important inputs into plant production.
    Due to natural influences (type of soil, climate, crop growth, etc.) there are
    considerable variations in the ability of the soil to supply water and fertiliser
    over time. So for controlling irrigation and fertilisation, real time feedback
    signals on soil state are needed. The overall aim of this paper is to achieve
    and to test signals characterising soil, in order to facilitate the above management
    actions. The signals should describe the water content and the nutritional state
    of the test site. Because sensors are the bottleneck in most control schemes for
    agricultural production processes, such investigations are a key to improve management.
    Closed loop control or minimisation procedures may then be developed straightforwardly.
    As the characterising signal the complex permittivity (=dielectric constant) of
    soil has been chosen. Techniques for measuring the soil permittivity include time
    domain (TDR-) sensors and frequency domain (FD-) sensors, see Noborio (2001) and
    Dirksen and Hilhorst (1994). For volumetric water content, various manufacturers
    offer appropriate sensors based on measuring the real part of permittivity. Recently
    a sensor had been developed and evaluated in an European project (Balendonck et
    al., 1998) to measure both, the real and imaginary part of permittivity. The real
    part of soil permittivity is known to depend strongly on its water content and
    is therefore suited for irrigation systems. Various authors, including Balendonck
    et al. (1998) have shown the possibilities of these sensors in a complete water
    control system. The imaginary part of the permittivity is related to the conductivity
    of the bulk soil, the three phase mixture of air, water and particles. Hilhorst
    (2000) has deduced that by measuring both the real and the imaginary part of permittivity
    (=bulk soil conductivity), the electrical conductivity (EC) of the pore water
    (=salinity) in soil can be computed. The salinity computed in this way expresses
    the ion concentration in the pore water, which is available for plants. In agricultural
    soils, nitrate is one of the most active and movable ions. So if ion conductivity
    can be measured, the next question is, whether the nitrate ion is the main influence
    on the salinity measurement. Further, it must be investigated whether the salinity
    values are influenced by the amount of diluting water in the soil pores. If so,
    then by taking the soil moisture (=volumetric water content) into account, the
    suitability of the humidity corrected ‘salinity’ as information for a controlled
    fertiliser application is to be tested. The objective of this paper is to study
    the correlations between the signals of permittivity and the actual states of
    water and fertiliser in soil. If there are strong correlations, continuous measurement
    in soil will open new possibilities for controlled agriculture. In particular,
    if fertilisation rates can be determined as simply as irrigation rates, new possibilities
    of controlling water and fertiliser application can be contemplated. 2. Methods
    2.1. Lysimeter set-up To provide the basis for a control scheme applicable to
    irrigation and fertilisation, three lysimeters of 1 m height and 50 cm diameter
    were installed. The tests in these laboratory lysimeters were intended to provide
    information on the behaviour of the above processes in soil. Two lysimeters contained
    different soils, i.e. sandy loam and loess, artificially filled with A and B horizons.
    The third lysimeter was equipped with original grassland (sandy loam). Sensors
    were imbedded for continuous measurements of both real and imaginary permittivity
    (water content and EC), together with tensiometers for measuring the water tension
    and with temperature sensors. Measurements were taken automatically every 20 min
    at three depths: 10, 50 and 90 cm each. Rape was chosen as the crop, because it
    is known to have strong, deep-going roots. It is therefore well suited to generate
    a dry deep layer and, by this, to guarantee no fertiliser or water transport beyond
    that barrier. Irrigation and fertilisation were carried out manually with weighed
    amounts. The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. Beside these 1 m lysimeters,
    for preliminary tests regarding the washout process and the ionic concentration
    in the drainage water six small lysimeters of 15 cm diameter as shown in Fig.
    2 were used. They were filled with different soils to a height of ∼20 cm. At the
    beginning the soil was rinsed with tap water (EC=0.1 mS/cm). Then fertiliser was
    dissolved and applied to the surface of the wet soil columns, corresponding to
    30, 60 or 90 kg N/ha. In the following weeks the soils were irrigated regularly
    every 2 or 3 days (depending on weekend) with ∼1/3 of their free water according
    to field capacity (≈200 ml). With each addition of water, fertiliser was washed
    through the soil column. The drainage water was collected after every watering
    event and measured for EC and nitrate. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    EC in washout water (FD, frequency domain sensor). 2.2. Real permittivity and
    water content For measuring the amount of water in soil, the real part of the
    bulk dielectric constant (real permittivity ε′) is known to be well suited. Practical
    instruments based on measurements in the time or at constant frequencies are offered
    by various providers. A new development on the standing-wave ratio (Sun et al.,
    1999) is promising. Unfortunately, the permittivity is not only dependent on the
    soil moisture, but also on temperature, density and on the type of soil. So each
    soil has to be calibrated. For sandy soils, often an approximation by Topp et
    al. (1980) is taken: (1) Newer developments (Paul et al., 1998) have shown that
    a self-calibration is also possible to a certain extent, when measuring over different
    frequencies (here 10, 20 and 30 MHz) and taking dispersion into account. Moreover,
    when evaluating this ‘Maxwell–Wagner effect’, the soil type can also be identified.
    2.3. Imaginary permittivity and electrical conductivity of pore water The imaginary
    part of soil permittivity ε″ is at frequencies low with respect to relaxation
    mainly influenced by the bulk soil conductivity (σbulk). The bulk soil conductivity
    is a function of the volumetric water content Θ and its ionic conductivity (ECwater
    or σwater). Conductivity of the free pore water (available for plants) is usually
    taken as a measure of soil salinity, because this conductivity is based only on
    the ionic concentration. As shown by Hilhorst (1998) and Hilhorst (2000), the
    ionic conductivity of the soil solution can be expressed by the measurable values
    of the complex permittivity of the bulk soil as (2) with σb=2pfε0εb″ as ionic
    bulk conductivity, at constant frequencies only dependent on the imaginary part
    of the bulk soil permittivity. The index w is the water stands for the water extractable
    from soil, the index b is the bulk denotes a measurement in bulk soil. The factor
    F is ∼1 in wet soil and εb dry can be measured with values between 3.5 and 8,
    depending on soil texture. As standard a value of 5 is taken. According to Eq.
    (2), σwater, the ionic conductivity of the soil solution available for plants,
    is so calculated from the simultaneously measured real and imaginary part of the
    permittivity of bulk soil (right part of Eq. (2)). 3. Preliminary measurements
    Preliminary measurements in the small lysimeters shown in Fig. 2 were made to
    compare the calculated salinity with the measured EC-value in the drainage water.
    The volumetric water content and the bulk conductivity of the soil were measured
    in the upper soil layer (5 cm). From these values the salinity of the soil was
    computed. The tests were done in various soils, here shown by the example of sandy
    loam. Of these lysimeters, three columns had normal density, in the other three
    columns a formerly treated soil (some residues of urea lead later on to deviations
    in nitrate concentration) was artificially compacted. Fig. 3 shows the development
    of EC and nitrate in drainage water compared to EC in soil and to salinity (EC
    in pore water). During each leaching a constant amount of ∼1/3 of the free water
    in soil was replaced. So the salts were washed out, appearing with some time delay
    in the drainage water. Because EC and nitrate in drainage water are developing
    in parallel, it seems obvious, that salinity measurements under agricultural circumstances
    were mostly influenced by the nitrate content. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. Development of salinity and accompanying values. If in soil the water
    replacement behaved as an ideal piston flow, after four irrigations the initial
    concentration at the surface would be washed through the column and would appear
    in the drainage water. As could be expected, the soil matrix retards the transition
    process. Because the EC values of the bulk soil were small and varied very little,
    they are omitted in the further discussion. The concentration is on the development
    of salinity, which is decreasing constantly as a result of the washout process.
    From Fig. 3 the following Fig. 4 was deduced, where the maximum salinities in
    both soil types are recorded. It shows that the amount of fertiliser applied is
    closely related to the salinity measurements in the upper soil layer. At low fertiliser
    input (30 kg N/ha) the reading in the compacted soil is topped by the urea residues,
    producing nitrate to a considerable amount by bacterial action. Given a known
    soil, the salinity corresponds to the actual fertiliser (mainly nitrate) state.
    This can also seen by the development of salinity in Fig. 5 during another leaching
    process, where also the amount of potassium (<1/10th of nitrate!) in the drainage
    water was recorded. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Measured initial

    experiments and discussion On the basis of the preliminary measurements, feedback
    simulations on irrigation and fertilisation were conducted in the 1 m indoor lysimeters.
    In these lysimeters rape was grown on sandy loam and on loess. During the test,
    no drainage occurred and the soil moisture varied according to water inputs and
    evapotranspiration. The irrigation was applied in doses of 4 mm (=1 l/lysimeter)
    or multiples of it (8 or 12 mm). 4.1. Controlled irrigation The experiment started
    with saturated, bare soil in the lysimeters. The total course of soil moisture
    over time in terms of volumetric water content is given in Fig. 6. The initial
    drying out at ∼18 °C with no crop was slow and therefore is not included here.
    The lysimeters were seeded with rape at the end of August. By October the crop
    had enough leaf area to transpire considerable amounts of water. Also a drying
    of deeper layers began, hinting that the crop had enough roots to reach all available
    water. In the middle of October, when the upper layer was completely dried out
    (10% or 500 kPa), a controlled irrigation dependent on actual state began. In
    November the upper soil layer was kept in a reasonably wet condition by manually
    controlled water inputs at a refill point of 20% soil moisture. The middle layer
    was held between 10 and 15% moisture, whereas the lowest layer further dried out
    continuously. At the end of the experiment (flowering of the rape) this development
    was still going on. The plants had been supplied with water to keep the upper
    layer at optimal moisture between 10 and 50 kPa, the deeper dry layer had developed
    up to dry 200 kPa. The figure also shows the time constants of the top, middle
    and deep layers. Whereas the surface layer reacts immediately to irrigation, the
    time constants in deeper layers are enormous. Basically, this picture is true
    for the other soil types. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Two point
    regulation of water content in the upper layer. It is interesting to compare the
    water tension and the water content during the simulated management of irrigation,
    because water tension is often said to be the better signal for irrigation. A
    daily water application of 1 l (=4 mm) or 2 l, depending on volumetric water content
    during the week, was combined with mostly 4 l during weekends. Fig. 6 shows that
    a classical 2 point controller, based on volumetric water content as measured
    by real permittivity, acting when the refill point of 20% is reached, can readily
    keep the optimum moisture at around tensions between 20 and 40 kPa or water contents
    between 20 and 25% in the upper layer. Even greater time intervals with no water
    input (weekends) can easily be processed. The moisture at 50 cm depth is held
    between 12 and 15% or 40 and 80 kPa. The wetter values are following the wetter
    conditions at the top with a considerable time lag. The drying out of the lowest
    layer was still underway at the end of recording. The experiment was repeated
    some months later (Fig. 7). It was started with a very shallow water table at
    1 m depth, which caused quite a wet soil. On 18th January the shallow water table
    was removed, and the soil dried out. At the end of January, irrigation began.
    As before, the amount of water again was given according to the actual volumetric
    water content. By measuring at different depths also the development of a dry
    layer beneath the root zone and so the minimisation of water usage can be seen.
    Fig. 7 shows this irrigation according to soil moisture measurements (here in
    terms of tensions) and a manually simulated two point controller with weekend
    variations beginning on 1st February. As above, in the long run the deeper layer
    dried out. With a controlled irrigation there was no difficulty in holding the
    preset conditions in the root zone, in terms of tension between 0 and 40 kPa.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Controlled irrigation of rape after
    removing shallow water table. 4.2. Controlled fertilisation As salinity is strongly
    influenced by plant available nitrogen (results reported above), then fertiliser
    can be applied according to demand. Advanced strategies such as minimum pollution
    via washout can be implemented. Experiments were carried out in the 1 m lysimeters
    filled with sandy loam and loess and growing rape. The salinities according to
    Eq. (2) are given in Fig. 8. Surprisingly, the expected increase in salinity following
    the fertilising event with 90 kg N/ha on 1st February could not be seen. The only
    steps to be seen are the decreases at the irrigation events, started on the same
    day. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Salinity as computed to Eq. (2).
    Clearly, when a given amount of salts is in solution, the concentration and therefore
    the salinity changes with the amount of diluting water. So the salinity values
    have to be corrected for soil moisture variations. To do this, both an extra drying
    processes and an evaluation of the measured values in the lysimeters were carried
    out. Fig. 9 shows the development of the salinity during concentration due to
    drying in two small lysimeters with sandy loam. Download : Download full-size

    2. Taking the salinity values of Fig. 8 and relating them to the measured soil
    moistures, here expressed as tensions, this dependence can also be seen in Fig.
    10. In soil, the processes are complicated (beginning with cation exchange, ending
    with microbiology) and partly unknown. However, from Fig. 9, Fig. 10 and the assumption
    that for some days the total change in salts including nitrate was limited (no
    washout, little plant uptake), a linear or a mild polynomial correction for the
    salinity can be considered. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Salinity
    over water tensions. A linear relation to a wet soil basis at field capacity was
    chosen. All salinity values (S) were then corrected. The linear correction formulas
    given empirically by Fig. 9 or Fig. 10 with tension h measured in kPa are (3)
    (4) With these corrected salinities, a clear response to plant uptake and fertilisation
    is obtained (Fig. 11). In January, the salinity in the upper soil layer decreased
    in both the sandy loam and the loess type of soils, due to plant uptake. On 1st
    February the effects of fertiliser applied equivalent to 90 kg N/ha (given as
    a full fertiliser), can be seen. Whereas in sandy loam a sharp increase occurred,
    in loess, with its buffer capacity, a smaller step was followed by a further increase.
    In both cases, after ∼2 weeks continued growth, the supply began to diminish.
    After ∼5 weeks the soil was depleted and nearly the same salinities were reached
    as immediately before fertilising. The original supply was taken up by the plants,
    and the next application of fertilising salts was necessary to avoid nutritional
    stress. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Salinity, corrected for wet
    soils. Based on the possibility to measure and compute the plant available salinity
    (mainly nitrate content in pore water), strategies for fertilising can be deduced.
    In the example of the lysimeter experiments with rape in sandy loam and loess,
    the decrease in salinity due to plant uptake can be seen. When the refill point
    is reached, the fertiliser can be applied. An increase in salinity (in sandy loam
    a step) after fertilisation and the following decrease because of further plant
    uptake is apparent in the upper soil layer (10 cm depth). After 1 month, the amount
    of fertiliser applied has been taken up. The next dosage can be deduced according
    to measured values of moisture corrected salinity in order to fill up the fertiliser
    reservoir and to keep salinity in an optimal range. 5. Conclusions The simultaneous
    measurement of permittivity in soil in its real and imaginary part offers new
    possibilities for controlled irrigation and fertilisation. Regarding irrigation
    only, by continuously sampling data on real permittivity at various depths, the
    total amount of needed water can be deduced. Regarding fertilisation, by measuring
    the corrected soil salinities, the total amount of needed fertiliser can be assessed.
    So with measuring the complex permittivity, at least in lysimeter experiments,
    there is a feedback signal for the two most important inputs to plant production.
    In particular, the approach to controlled fertilisation based on measuring salinity
    is promising. The salinity expresses the ion concentrations (under agricultural
    conditions mainly nitrate ions) in the pore water, which are available for plants
    and which equals the amount of salts possibly washed out into deeper soil layers.
    To come to a controlled fertiliser application, a correction of the salinity values
    to the state in wet soils is proposed. These corrections can be calibrated for
    different soils. For practical application individual measurements may suffer
    from natural variabilities (Schmitz and Sourell, 2000). So a single point assessment
    would have clear limits in the above control context. But with multiple measurements
    and appropriate mean values a new approach is given not only for controlled irrigation
    but also for optimal plant nutrition or minimal pollution. Acknowledgements The

    rights and content Abstract Our planet is facing a serious fresh water crisis
    and improved management of water resources presents significant research challenges.
    About 70% of the world''s fresh water is consumed by agriculture and water application
    efficiencies are typically low. Improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture
    would deliver substantial economic and environmental benefits. To help address
    the issue of low water application efficiency, wireless sensor network technologies
    can be combined with automation to support the efficient production of food in
    a increasingly water limited future. This paper reports on results of combining
    these approaches to irrigate an apple orchard, where existing irrigation scheduling
    was predominately based on time consuming manual acquisition of soil moisture
    data. The system developed allowed fully automated on-farm irrigation based on
    real-time feedback control which increased economic water use efficiency by 73%
    compared with manual irrigation. It is suggested that the application of real-time
    feedback automation would dramatically improve economic efficiency for irrigators
    with low water efficiency. Whereas, for those irrigators already achieving high
    water efficiency, adoption of the technology provides substantial labour and time
    savings. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords AgricultureEnvironmentsFeedback

    of resources like water and electricity will pose a great risk to horticultural
    crop production and society activities. Precision irrigation poses a great opportunity
    to save water and energy in agriculture. The current off-the-shelf machines used
    to control water are incompatible to Tanzanian conditions, very expensive, delicate,
    or don''t have enough features. This study proposed a reprogrammable control system
    prototype design and implementation that can be used for African countries, particularly
    in Tanzania. The proposed integrated controller is a solar-powered system that
    uses low cost electronic devices to automate drip irrigation and to determine
    when to irrigate and how much to irrigate. The controller has been tested under
    African farms and achieved a high level of reliability and maintainability. The
    controller is a high tech tool that can be reprogrammed or updated wirelessly
    using a laptop and the data can be downloaded using any android based smartphone.
    The wireless technology incorporated can be used to transfer instant data of rainfall
    and soil moisture content. The system automates data cleaning while collecting
    instant information of the soil moisture, temperature, humidity and rainfall.
    It can store data at least for seven days. Published in: Proceedings of the 2nd

    IEEE Conference Location: Arusha, Tanzania SECTION I. Introduction Most agriculture
    in Tanzania has yet to achieve the high yields and high quality crops which are
    possible. The appropriate use of modern technologies may help. Precision irrigation
    may be advantageous in Tanzania, as elsewhere, by saving water, producing better
    crops, and reducing costs. Schueller (1992) discusses that this management of
    crop production according to localized conditions is variously known as spatially-variable,
    site-specific, soil-specific, precision, or prescription crop production Many
    computerized tools have been used around the world for scheduling irrigation deliveries
    and improving irrigation project management. The possibility for easily creating
    and changing scenarios allows the consideration of multiple alternatives for irrigation
    scheduling, including the adoption of crop specific irrigation management options.
    Scenarios may include different irrigation scheduling options inside the same
    project area applied to selected fields, crops, or sub-areas corresponding to
    irrigation sectors. This allows tailoring irrigation management according to identified
    requirements (Pedro Fortes et al. 2004 and Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2004). Meron et
    al. (2001) discussed the use of tensiometers to automatically irrigate apple trees.
    They noted that spatial variability was problematic when the tensiometers were
    installed 30 cm from the drip irrigation emitters. Smajstrla and Koo (1986) and
    Muñoz-Carpena et al. (2005) discussed the problems associated with using tensiometers
    to initiate irrigation events in Florida. Problems included entrapped air in the
    tensiometers, organic growth on the ceramic cups, and the need for re-calibration.
    Muñoz-Carpena et al.(2005) found that both tensiometer-and GMS-controlled drip
    irrigation systems on tomato saved water when compared to typical farmer practices.
    Khriji et al. (2014) reported that always the challenge is to create an automated
    irrigation system which can reduce in the same time the water''s waste and is
    cost effective. In this study, an attempt was made to develop a precision irrigation
    control system (PICS) that can control water using different algorithms. It can
    be reprogrammed to meet precision irrigation parameters in irrigation scheduling
    of deciding “when” and “how” to apply an appropriate amount of water in the field.
    The “Scheduling” program computes the right amount of irrigation deliveries based
    on crop water requirements. The “Monitoring” program gives information on the
    uniformity of water distribution and the shortfall or excess (Rowson and Amin,
    2010). The right amount of daily irrigation supply and monitoring at the right
    time within the discrete irrigation unit is quite essential to improve the irrigation
    water management of the scheme. Proper irrigation scheduling can reduce irrigation
    demand and increase productivity. A large number of tools are available to support
    field irrigation scheduling, from in-field and remote sensors to simulation models.
    Irrigation scheduling models are particularly useful to support individual farmers
    and irrigation advisory services (Ortega et al., 2005). Using the information
    provided from several sensors it is possible to calculate the right amount of
    daily irrigation supply. Torre-Neto and Schueller (2000) successfully used instrumented
    tensiometers in a precision agriculture system to irrigate groups of four or five
    citrus trees. In this study source of soil information is the sensors installed
    in the soil profile. Culibrk et al., (2014) discussed the other sources for precision
    irrigation using satellite. The satellite data of interest for the precision irrigation
    is mostly data relevant to the water cycle, hydrology and meteorology and provided
    by missions aimed at gathering such data. Re-programmable devices, like cellphones
    where someone can update software or download an app are better than fixed devices.
    This control system will have such a technique where a farmer can update the software
    and change the algorithm that is up-to-date of the farming activities while using
    the same device. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Design Criteria for the
    New Irrigation Controller The irrigation controller (IC) was implemented using
    several design criteria. The design criteria were based on how to build, what
    to incorporate and how to be operated. The design includes the IC which is low
    cost, small, and durable, with low energy requirements. The IC which is self-adjusting,
    using sensors, loop feedback algorithms and fuzzy logic. The IC requires very
    minimum attention from farmers. The main function of the IC is to measure the
    daily water requirements of the crop and respond by applying the correct amount
    of irrigation water regardless of changing environmental conditions. The IC created
    is capable of optimally supplying water to the crop using existing harsh infrastructure
    and resources (spring, river, lake water, local fertilizers, and available energy
    sources). The IC is also capable of adapting to the existing resources of the
    farm without any significant modification or change. The design included basic
    data logging and history reporting features that have been incorporated in the
    IC design. A simple, user-friendly interface of liquid crystal display (LCD),
    menu and buttons is used to configure the IC, with the remote wireless control
    and monitoring features with an existing cellular android smartphone or computer
    or other Wi-Fi-capable device. Mafuta et al. (2013) discussed sensor positioning
    design in the root zone for drip irrigated farmland. Sensor positioning in the
    root zone of the plant is crucial, because it determines the amount of water to
    be applied during each irrigation event. A sensor placed very deep into the soil
    allows the irrigation system to apply more water up to that depth beyond plant
    roots; the water below plant roots is lost through deep percolation. B. Design
    Procedures Taken To achieve the goals of this project, the following design procedures
    were included in the project tasks; Firstly, Information gathering survey was
    done. This included baseline data collection. Baseline data from horticultural
    crops farms, existing infrastructure, energy, water, fertilizer resources, field
    identification and description of existing horticultural crops production methods
    were fetched. Secondly, Conceptual design of controller functions/requirements,
    identification of suitable hardware and design of prototype software/firmware,
    and enclosure was done. Then, schematic circuit design and testing phase on a
    breadboard platform (solderless working electronic prototype) for identification
    of incompatibilities and durability of hardware components was done. After that,
    the designing and building the first soldered prototype electronic circuit board,
    using software PCB123 and tools was carefully done. Then, prototype enclosure
    with LCD display and input buttons were installed or soldered. Installation of
    the rugged enclosure design with LCD display, Wi-Fi connection and user input
    buttons was finally done. Thirdly, Repetitive and randomly modified tests continuously
    (24/7) with several ICs to rigorously were done to evaluate accuracy and reliability.
    This rigorous rapid testing helped to rapidly identify problems early on for debugging,
    durability development. Android-based software to control the irrigation system
    was developed to be used for farmers. C. Development Procedures The development
    started earlier in May, 2013 at Lake Alfred, Florida, USA. This research is carried
    out in whole year until June, 2014 at Sokoine university of Agriculture, Morogoro,
    Tanzania. Through this development scenario then the development procedures were
    divided into three phases: 1) Phase 1 System Development Identification and purchases
    of electronic components for the IC, latching solenoid valves, tipping bucket
    rain gauges, flow meters, pressure gauges, soil moisture sensors, temperature/humidity
    and light sensors, etc. was done. Simple programs for the Microchip peripheral
    interface controller (PIC) to read a keyboard, display information on a LCD, and
    to log sensor data were developed. Individual part testing continued for all parts/modules
    of the IC that include; Real time clock, Serial port for in-circuit programming/debugging,
    Serial LCD display and 12-button keypad, EEPROM memory for data storage: suggest
    Microchip 24AA1025 (128 Kbytes, 12C protocol), Soil moisture sensors interfaced
    with SDI-12 half duplex serial protocol, oscillator frequency and sleep modes
    for lowest power use, A/D interface for reading analog voltage of the solar panel,
    Pulse counting with I/O pins to read rain gauge and flow meter, Solar panel +
    rechargeable battery power management algorithm 2) Phase 2 Advanced System Development
    Development of a DC latching valve control driver with H-bridge was done. Development
    of simple feedback control and fuzzy logic methods for the PICS was done. These
    methods were incorporated into the IC for closed-loop control of irrigation for
    optimal soil moisture regulation. Construction of the first version of the IC
    printed circuit board was done. Up to this point, breadboard was used for development.
    3) Phase 3 System Deployment Addition of Wi-Fi and smart phone capabilities was
    done. Installation of IC and all other components to run the irrigation for the
    okra plants was done. Testing and tuning the IC in the okra irrigation system
    in Tanzania was done. Adjustment and tuning the feedback control and fuzzy logic
    algorithms for the okra irrigation system was done continuously. D. Design of
    the Irrigation Control System Fig. 1. Advanced conceptual diagram of the controller
    Show All Fig. 2. Controller at the testing site, crop museum, sokoine university
    of agriculture Show All Figure 1 above gives a more advanced demonstration of
    the conceptual design of the system. This section of study discusses advanced
    conceptual diagram. And the Figure 2 gives an illustrative instrument of the conceptual
    design. The main controller (MC) consists of all other subparts and it acts as
    the master in the master-slave configuration of two main PIC microcontrollers.
    The moisture, flow, rain gauge, humidity and temperature sensor report to it.
    Since the solenoid valves needs to be controlled based upon the message feeds
    from the main controller, then the slave will need to be off all the time except
    it is requested to turn on or off the latching solenoid valves. The wireless module
    will be connected to the main microcontroller for the smart communication of IC
    with smart devices such as laptops and Android phones. It is crucial that this
    IC needs to send information it has collected to the smart devices that will allow
    further processing of the information for post decision management. The main controller
    is connected to a time keeper module and a memory unit. The time keeper module
    is a separate part from the main controller but sends time information to it.
    The MC needs the time to schedule the irrigation. The memory unit is used to keep
    information needed for further processing. It is crucial that data can be downloaded
    from the IC for analysis. Also, the system is connected to solar panel systems
    that will be providing full power to the system. This is essential since the system
    will be used in farmers'' fields where no electricity power is provided. See figure
    2 below for a more advanced conceptual diagram of the IC. The water controller
    (WC) is the slave unit of the master MC. It acts upon requests from the MC. It
    is always OFF unless turned on by the MC. It''s very crucial unit that is connected
    to high voltage (>12V) for opening and closing the valves. The system operations
    depend upon its working conditions. The WC is connected to the H-Bridge chips
    (HBC). The WC is the one that is listening and answering to the MC. It then controls
    the HBC. The HBC chips can direct the current in either direction to open or close
    the latch valves. E. PICS Commands The PICS can be instructed using commands.
    The software program inside the MC can communicate with all the sensors and slave
    microcontroller. This design was essential as it allows any third party designer
    to a design wireless controlling program through any devices of choice such as
    windows-based or Android-based as it will be presented in coming subsections.
    These commands act like an interface between the PICS and connected wireless devices
    like phones and laptops. SECTION III. Results and Discussions a) Windows-Based
    Application for Windows (Tiny Bootloader) The programming of many microcontrollers
    needs a compiler and programmer. The PIC microcontroller can be programmed wirelessly
    and it does not need a programmer which is expensive. Instead, the compiler will
    be used to compile the program and the program will be loaded to the microcontroller
    wirelessly. This process works seamlessly with the PICS environment allowing upgrades
    of the PICS software to be carried easily. b) Android-Based Software for PICS
    The PICS works very well with the PC but not all farmers will be using the PC
    all the days. The app that can work very well with PICS was developed as the tool
    to make a follow up on the irrigation. The app needs wireless capabilities of
    the android phone. The PICS always gives Wi-Fi connectivity to it. This allows
    seamless connection between the phone and the PICS. However, this is connection
    is limited to distance covered by the Wi-Fi networks (<100 meters). More coverage
    would be covered by using Wi-Fi extender which will increase cost to the farmer.
    The app was developed with necessary features like reset, collection of data,
    sensor requests and instant display of the PICS messages while processing the
    data. Fig. 3. Android based software that works with pics Show All Figure 4 shows
    control of water using two limits, lower limit and upper limit. This control is
    of great importance as it reduces the time used to switch on or off the solenoid
    valves and hence saves water. But this control will give a very rough control
    when visualized for effectiveness. Figure 4 demonstrates how to control water
    supply to the plants using upper and lower limit. The system will irrigate until
    it finds that 39% of soil moisture is detected and then it stops to irrigate until
    depletion is lower than 31%. The observation in the table 5 show that the drip
    irrigated soil using emitters of 0.5 liter per hour will only take about 20–30
    minutes to increase more than 10% of soil moisture when the sensors are located
    20cm in the soil profile. That''s means only 167–250 ml of the water. This observation
    gave a conclusion that if we irrigate for 4 minutes only then less than 3% of
    soil moisture will be increased in the soil profile. Figure 4: Water balancing
    at 35% and having +4% upper limits and −4% lower limits (31%-39%) Show All SECTION
    IV. Conclusion Results of the experiment showed that the machine actually can
    control water using signals from the Acclima TDT moisture sensors. This type of
    automation has achieved relatively reliable control in terms of moisture at the
    depth of 20 cm and 35% soil moisture. The machine was able to collect all the
    data regarding rainfall, humidity and temperature. The data collected had some
    problems but at least 80% of the data were correct and allowed system control.
    The experiments showed that effective control is achieved when the system is allowed
    to control every 4 minutes compared to 20 minutes or one hour control. More precise
    control is boosted by reducing the time to collect sensor information. Precision
    irrigation control system has shown a great potential to African farms applicability.
    Systems like this will need replications for demo use in African farms. The cost
    of replicating one unit is still very high, approximately more than 600 USD plus
    sensor costs. That will bring the cost to about 1000 USD. This cost is very high
    for Tanzanian farmers but can be afforded to large scale productions such as grape
    crops or flowers production may find it more useful for them. More research is
    needed to cater the economic cost of precision agriculture tools. Most of them
    that are present in the market cost more than 1000 USD and they are very delicate
    and can be destroyed very easily. The instrument has performed very well in the
    field. The shield used was able to withstand dry and wet seasons and the system
    was not hurt. The instrument wireless connection was performing well. All the
    time the system was reachable using both the laptop and phone. The soil moisture
    sensors were performing very well while in the soil. No any sensor failed during
    all the tests. The system performance was dependent on the rainfall and humidity
    sensor also. The sensors worked very well at the field and the shield used to
    protect from weather. More researches should focus on determination of the minimum
    cost that farmers could incur to purchase precision agriculture. The cost of the
    technology always decreases with number of the users. Hence, if more users require
    the instrument the less the cost it becomes. The government of Tanzania should
    modify the policy of technology transfer to farmers. The government and Non-governmental
    organization should sponsor practical testing of the instrument to the farmers
    and make sure that few examples are engaged to the farmers and be encouraged to
    use new technologies. The PICS prototype has set technology advancement in Tanzania;
    local production of such systems will give the government an opportunity to be
    the leading producers of irrigation controls in Africa. ACKNOLEDGMENT Special

    sensor, drip irrigation management DOI:   10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1057.53 Abstract:
    The proper management of irrigation systems is a key factor to achieve an efficient
    use of water and an adequate crop production. The use of new automatic control
    and communication technologies, offers a set of tools for data gathering and analysis,
    and assists agronomists and farmers to take better decisions in order to develop
    a sustainable agriculture, able to maintain its productivity and to be useful
    to the society in the long term. This work presents the implementation and set-up
    of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system designed to supervise
    and control a drip irrigation system. The irrigation system is installed in a
    young olive orchard, located in San Juan, an arid region fully dependent on irrigation.
    The main task of the system is to gather and display the information coming from
    the field devices (soil moisture sensors, weather station, water flow-meters and
    programmable-logic-controller (PLC) for commanding the irrigation system) and
    automatically control the irrigation. The main screen of the SCADA software presents
    current information related to the process and, in other tabs, gives a detailed
    report of data. The gathered information is saved to a data base that can be accessed
    by different users, allowing the participation of other users, such as irrigation
    advisers, laboratories, quality control, maintenance, etc. Information can be
    accessed locally, through internet or by other means. Results of this experience
    show that it is possible to apply new technological tools to manage the irrigation
    process as a way to improve its efficiency. Article - full text (enhanced PDF

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Xi''an, China 1. Introduction Water-saving
    irrigation can be defined as the way to save or reduce the amount of water for
    irrigation diverted from streams, reservoirs, underwater or other water sources
    by using different technical water-saving measures as well as garden water-saving
    measures and administrative water-saving measures. This is a traditional way for
    saving water and is popular now. Based on this, a nationwide water-saving irrigation
    campaign is under way. Urban green space is a multi-layered community formed by
    trees, shrubs and grass in a certain way and proportion; this multi-layered community
    which is composed of different plants has different requirements about water,
    so in order to meet the growth needs of different plants, different irrigation
    methods and different irrigation amounts shall be employed. People can hardly
    control the different irrigation methods and different irrigation amounts in the
    same irrigation system by themselves, while autocontrol can help to realize irrigation
    in appropriate time with the right amount. This paper mainly describes the types
    and work principles of automatic turf irrigation system. Sign in to Continue Reading

    \ Number 1 \nCopyright by author(s); CC-BY \n19 \nThe Clute Institute \nDecision\
    \ Making And Systems  \nThinking: Educational Issues \nM. Kudret Yurtseven, Izmir\
    \ University, Turkey \nWalter W. Buchanan, Texas A&M University, College Station,\
    \ USA \n \n \nABSTRACT \n \nDecision making in most universities is taught within\
    \ the conventional OR/MS (Operations Research/Management \nScience) paradigm.\
    \  This paradigm is known to be “hard” since it is consisted of mathematical tools,\
    \ and normally \nsuitable for solving structured problems. In complex situations\
    \ the conventional OR/MS paradigm proves to be \ninadequate; decisions must be\
    \ based on systems thinking which provides the decision maker(s) the opportunity\
    \ to \naddress the problematic situation in its full system context. The aim here\
    \ is to develop a framework and a new \ncourse to teach “decision making through\
    \ systems thinking” to industrial engineering students. The new course is to \n\
    be taken after the existing course which covers the traditional OR/MS paradigm.\
    \ It is believed that such an \n“extended” framework will help students to improve\
    \ their skills in handling complex decision situations.  \n \nKeywords: Decision\
    \ Making; Systems Thinking; Industrial Engineering Education; OR/MS Paradigm;\
    \ Problem \nStructuring Methods \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nhen decision making\
    \ is taught within the framework of classical management science/operations \n\
    research (MS/OR) paradigm, which sometimes is referred as hard operations research,\
    \ the \nemphasis is usually put on the mathematical tools and techniques. In cases\
    \ where the problematic \nsituation can be clearly described, there are various\
    \ tools available for decision making; such as mathematical \nprogramming, game\
    \ theory, simulation models, Markov chain models, decision tress, etc. However,\
    \ in other cases, \nsuch as in decision situations faced by top managers, there\
    \ may be too much ambiguity about the objective and \ndecision options. Sometimes\
    \ the information and knowledge available to make an effective decision may be\
    \ \nuncertain, incomplete, or even distorted. Under such conditions the problematic\
    \ situation must be described in its \nfull system context. As early as 2005 Jamali\
    \ warned that the existing decision-making processes are no longer \nadequate,\
    \ and urged educational institutions to teach newly developing decision-making\
    \ paradigms (Jamali, 2005). \nIn complex situations there are actors with differing\
    \ goals, preferences, and perceptions. The organizational \nstructure, culture,\
    \ and personal inclinations of managers influence the decision making process.\
    \ The difficulties \ninvolved become more pronounced when there are rapid changes\
    \ in the internal and external dynamics of the \norganization –particularly in\
    \ external dynamics. Organizations can survive and grow only if they can adapt\
    \ \nthemselves to this fast change. The change forces adaptation, and adaptation\
    \ is required in many dimensions \nincluding the existing decision making processes.\
    \  According to Hummelbrunner and Williams (2011), there are \nthree main principles\
    \ in managing complexity: decentralization, collaborative and adaptive management.\
    \ Gorzen-\nMitka, et. al. (2014) defend a similar position, arguing that strategic\
    \ decision-making in complex environments \nrequires meta-cognitive skills and\
    \ a tool-bag for innovative and adaptable decision models beyond linear thinking.\
    \   \n \nComplexity has always been one of the central concepts in systems movement.\
    \ Gorze-Mitka, et.al. (2014) traces the \nroots of “modern complexity” to the\
    \ birth of General Systems Theory which was pioneered by Ludwig von \nBertalanffy.\
    \ The complexity issue was also addressed in Weiner’s work on cybernetics and\
    \ in the work of other \nimportant names in systems movement, such as Churchman,\
    \ Ackoff, Beer, Weinberg, Forrester, and Gigch \n(Skyttner, 2001 and 2006) . Snyder\
    \ (2013) points out that researchers at the Santa Fe Institute attempted to unify\
    \ \nsome of the core system concepts into a model known as complex adaptive systems\
    \ which still is an evolving \nconstruct. It is argued that emergent properties\
    \ of complex systems can be modeled and operated relatively more \neffectively\
    \ as complex adaptive systems. (Aelker, et. al. 2013) and (Satkamaya, et, al,\
    \ 2014)  discuss the approach \nW \nAmerican Journal of Engineering Education\
    \ – June 2016 \nVolume 7, Number 1 \nCopyright by author(s); CC-BY \n20 \nThe\
    \ Clute Institute \nand its applications in some depth. \nThere are various studies\
    \ that specifically address complexity decision making via holistic or systems\
    \ approach. For \ninstance, Sondoss et.al. (2015) handle the complexity in a viticulture\
    \ irrigation management System in South \nAustralia. They present a step-wise\
    \ methodology that integrates qualitative information into formal simulation \n\
    models, involving cognitive mapping and agent based modelling approaches. The\
    \ resulting structure seems to be \ncapturing the richness of decision making\
    \ and mental models. Pagani and Otto (2013) adopts qualitative mapping \ntheory\
    \ building and quantitative group model building approaches in a computer-based\
    \ system modeling \nenvironment for market startegy development. They claim that\
    \ this holistic apparoach enhances the quality of the \ndecision processes.  Carlman,\
    \ et.al. (2014) relate the complexity issue to sustainability in decision making\
    \ processes, \nparticularly in ecological systems.  The decision structure developed\
    \ provides communication and collaboration \nbetween a technical-scientific group\
    \ and social scientists via a holistic outlook. Swami’s work (2013), on the other\
    \ \nhand, views decision making under the broad topic of executive functions or\
    \ cognitive processes that regulate, \ncontrol, and manage other cognitive processes.\
    \ This holistic approach includes theories and concepts from \npsychology, behavioural\
    \ economics, operations research, and managerial practice. Schiuma, et.al. (2012)\
    \ report a \nsystems thinking-based framework where knowledge assets are translated\
    \ into organizational value for making good \ndecisions.  Similarly, Wiek, et.al.’s\
    \ study (2009) presents a framework  called The Transdisciplinary Integrated \n\
    Planning and Synthesis (TIPS), which is mainly based on soft OR methods. This\
    \ particular framework makes use of \na multi-methodological approach involving\
    \ cognitive skills and habits of the stakeholders, and experts and their \nmutual\
    \ and joint transdisciplinary learning processes. This framework was applied in\
    \ a large-scale regional planning \nprocess in Switzerland.  The interested reader\
    \ can find a number of models/methods/systems that have been \ndeveloped to underpin\
    \ sustainable decision-making in environmental impact assessment, life cycle assessment,\
    \ \necological footprints, cost benefit analysis, etc. (Sondoss, et. al., 2015),\
    \ (Carlman, et. al., 2014), (Schiuma, et. al., \n2012), (Petkov, et. al., 2009)\
    \ and (Taylor, et. al., 2011). \n \nThe material in the paper will be presented\
    \ in the following order: the fundamental role of system thinking in \ndecision\
    \ making is assessed in the next section; this will be followed by sections on\
    \ potential contributions of \nsystems thinking in decision making, and the description\
    \ of the framework and the new course developed.  \n \nSystems Thinking and Decision\
    \ Making \n \nSystems thinking developed over the last decades to overcome the\
    \ inadequacies of classical science and to search for \nsolutions to complex problematic\
    \ situations in a holistic manner. Although quite impressive developments occurred\
    \ \nin the last decades, there is still plenty of work to do in systems thinking\
    \ area. Back in 1993, Hitchins (1993) \nsuggested that “the present approach is\
    \ short-lived, rigid, and expensive” – meaning systems thinking. He proposed \n\
    that we should learn from nature, and conceive higher order adaptive systems using\
    \ genetic methods. According to \nhim, adopting an accelerated evolutionary approach\
    \ by building complex adaptive socio-technical systems, without \nfully understanding\
    \ the incomprehensible complex human-system interaction is needed (Hitchins, 2003).\
    \ The 2020 \nvision of Systems Engineering (SE) published by INCOSE (International\
    \ Council on Systems Engineering) also \nsuggests that developments in genetics\
    \ and technology will make significant contributions to SE (INCOSE, 2005). \n\
    Similar views were expressed by other researchers in the past, including Skyttner\
    \ (2001 and 2006). According to \nhim, the old worldview has not been kept up\
    \ to date to take account of contemporary change and the world society \nand its\
    \ institutions are not functioning effectively. He suggests a transformation from\
    \ the reactive view into a \npredictive and anticipatory mode. Despite some shortcomings,\
    \ a variety of significant soft systems methodologies \nhave been developed since\
    \ the 1980s that overcame some of the limitations of the hard school (Jackson,\
    \ 2000 and \n2003), (Maani, et.al. 2007), (Mingers, et.al. 2010), (Mingers, 2010\
    \ and 2011), and (Yurtseven and Buchanan, 2012).  \n \nProbably the most important\
    \ “break away” from the hard school is related to the concept of objectivity.\
    \ The claim of \n“objectivity” of classical science is found to be problematic\
    \ in a soft systems school; it is seen as nothing but an \nillusion.  It is argued\
    \ that it is meaningless to formulate objective aims and objective means in complex\
    \ situations. \nThe actors involved in the process are bound to have different\
    \ perspectives of the problematic situation or the \nreality, and they will highly\
    \ likely suggest different solutions. For instance, Soft Systems Methodology (SSM),\
    \ one \nof the well known methodologies, developed by Checkland, embraces a paradigm\
    \ of learning rather than viewing \nthe world as systems whose performance can\
    \ be optimized by following systematic procedures (Checkland and \nScholes, 1990)\
    \ and (Checkland, 1993). The conventional system methodologies such as System\
    \ Analysis, Systems \nAmerican Journal of Engineering Education – June 2016 \n\
    Volume 7, Number 1 \nCopyright by author(s); CC-BY \n21 \nThe Clute Institute\
    \ \nEngineering, Hard Operations Research, System Dynamics, (Hard) Cybernetics\
    \ are based on systematic procedures. \nThe tendency seen in SSM can also be found\
    \ in other soft methodologies, such as Warfield’s Interactive \nManagement, Churchman’s\
    \ Social Systems Design, Mason and Mitroff’s Strategic Assumption Surfacing and\
    \ \nTesting, Ackoff’s Social Systems Sciences, Senge’s Systems Thinking, Soft\
    \ OR, Soft System Dynamics, and Soft \nCybernetics.  \n \nMethodology Selection\
    \  \n \nOne of the most difficult tasks in a decision-making process is to choose\
    \ the “best” methodology available, like in \nall complex system studies. According\
    \ to Jackson (2003), selection of the appropriate methodology for any type of\
    \ \nsystems study is related the context of the problem - this is obviously true\
    \ also for decision making. Jackson’s view \nis illustrated in Table 1. Here,\
    \ six ideal-type forms of problem context are given by combining the ‘systems’\
    \ and \n‘participants’ dimensions. They are simple-unitary, simple-pluralist,\
    \ simple-coercive, complex-unitary, complex-\npluralist and complex-coercive.\
    \ Jackson (2003) then relates the problem context to different classes of systems\
    \ \nmethodologies as shown in Table 2. Here, the corresponding methodologies are\
    \ classified as (1) Functionalist \nSystems Approach, (2) Interpretive Systems\
    \ Approach, (3) Emancipatory Systems Approach, (4) Postmodern \nSystems Approach,\
    \ and (5) Critical Systems Thinking.  \n \nTable 1. Jackson’s extended version\

    \ \n \nThe reader should note that hard systems thinkers work in that grid of\
    \ problem contexts where it is assumed that \npeople share values and beliefs,\
    \ and that systems are simple enough to be mathematically modeled. The simple-\n\
    unitary approach is known to be successful in tackling a whole variety of operational\
    \ issues (such as, inventory, \nqueuing, scheduling, and routing problems), but\
    \ it fails in complex situations. In complex-unitary situations, System \nDynamics,\
    \ Organizational Cybernetics and Complexity Theory can be useful while complex-pluralistic\
    \ situations \ncan be resolved via soft system approaches. Needless to say, it\
    \ is not possible to draw clear lines between different \nsystems and different\
    \ problem categories as shown in the above tables, but they provide vital clues\
    \ to decision \nmakers. The reader is reminded that Critical Systems Thinking\
    \ is recommended when a variety of methodologies, \nmethods and models need to\
    \ be employed simultaneously in complexity (Jackson 2000 and 2003) and (Flood\
    \ et. al., \n1998).  \n \nThe methodology-problem context issue is also addressed\
    \ by (Kurtz, et.al., 2003). Their framework is is shown in \nTable 3 and known\
    \ as the “Cynefin sense-making framework” (Maani, et.al.,2007). Systems are classified\
    \ as \nKnown, Knowable, Complex and Chaos. The Known systems are systems that\
    \ have perceivable and predictable \ncause-and-effect relationships and can be\
    \ handled via Sense-Categorize-Respond type methodologies (e.g. process \nre-engineering).\
    \ In the Knowable category, cause and effect are separated over time and space,\
    \ and Sense-Analyze-\nRespond type methodologies are suitable - e.g. System Dynamics\
    \ (Maani,et.al., 2007). Complex systems, on the \nother hand, are viewed as systems\
    \ with cause-and-effect relationships that are coherent in retrospect and do not\
    \ \nrepeat; the appropriate methodologies for this category are the Probe-Sense-Respond\
    \ type (e.g. pattern \nmanagement). Cause-and-effect relationships are not perceivable\
    \ in chaotic systems and can be handled only by the \nAct-Sense-Respond approach\
    \ (e.g. crisis management). As mentioned before, drawing clear boundaries between\
    \ \ndifferent classes is not possible. The reader should note that the types of\
    \ decision problems considerd in this study \nfall into the Known and Knowable\
    \ regions. \nAmerican Journal of Engineering Education – June 2016 \nVolume 7,\

    \ \n \nWhen it comes to the classification of decision making methods, Pownall\
    \ (2012) gives us a useful picture. The four \ncategories are: \n \n(a) A qualitative\
    \ perspective which is an integrative approach (or rational normative). \n(b)\
    \ A perspective achieved by combining quantitative and behavioral disciplines\
    \ in an interdisciplinary \nmanner. \n(c) An interlocking perspective where the\
    \ engagement of one perspective limits the use of other \nperspectives. \n(d)\
    \ A cause-effect view where decisions taken are interrelated across organizational\
    \ events. \n \nSystems thinking-based decision making does not exclude perspectives\
    \ (a), (b) and (d). Furthermore, it removes the \nlimitations implied by (c).\
    \  Figure 1 shows the relative positions of different approaches as a function\
    \ of changing \ncomplexity. While sequential decision making (problems are formulated\
    \ as a sequence of “independent” decisions) \nis very algorithmic, appearing at\
    \ the left of the scale, anarchical decision making is far on the right. The RAT\
    \ \n(rational- normative model of decision making) and three-phased (problem identification,\
    \ solution development, and \nsolution selection) models are closer to sequential\
    \ decision making, respectively, and heuristic models are closer to \nthe other\
    \ edge.  \n \nFigure 1. Moving beyond RAT (rational model of decision making)\
    \ (Pownall, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe normative or rational models are based on the\
    \ assumption that all relevant and pertinent information is available \nfor optimal\
    \ decision making–such as in cost-benefit analysis. The three-phased model, on\
    \ the other hand, recognizes \nthat the solution development and solution selection\
    \ are not separate cognitive processes as they are in the RAT \nmodel; these processes\
    \ overlap and can occur simultaneously. Moving to the right in the figure makes\
    \ decision \nprocesses more complicated since cohesive groups emerge in highly\
    \ pressurized and often political context. As one \ngoes towards “Anarchical Decision\
    \ Making” region, the need to make use of heuristic approaches becomes \ninevitable.\
    \ The models here tend to become more “irrational” where human decision values\
    \ are incorporated into the \nRAT \n3 Phase \nHeuristics \nSequential \nDecision\

    23 \nThe Clute Institute \nprocess. The decision maker may incorporate any of\
    \ these models in systems thinking-based approach. \n \nMonte Carlo Modeling can\
    \ also be a useful tool in complex decisions making situations (Pownall 2012,\
    \ Parnell, \net.al. 2011, Taylor III, 2013). The decision maker does not need\
    \ to rely upon measurable input data or subjective \nestimates of likelihoods\
    \ of given events occurring, and does not need to know the assumptions behind\
    \ the patterns \nfor success or failures in the environment. Instead, potential\
    \ outcomes of a decision problem are assigned weights \nvia the use of pseudo\
    \ random numbers, allowing the decision maker to produce decisions without referring\
    \ to the \ndecision context. In this way, the difficulty involved in the explicit\
    \ treatment of uncertainty is avoided, thanks to the \nextensive use of computers.\
    \ Due to its versatility, Monte Carlo modeling is covered in many textbooks today\
    \ \n(Hazelrigg, 1996), (Daellanbach, 2005), (Parnell, et. al. 2011), (Krajewski,\
    \ et. al., 2013) and (Taylor III, 2013).  \n \nThe Framework and New Course Proposed\
    \  \n \nThe following framework is designed to guide instructors in teaching “Decision\
    \ Making” to undergraduate students \nwho are expected to face various different\
    \ situations in industry, whether simple or complex. It is made up of five \n\
    parts: Fundamentals; Rational Models with Quantitative Methods; Rational Models\
    \ with Qualitative Methods; \nHolistic Decision Models; Optional Material. The\
    \ instructor may design a suitable course or a set of courses to \nsatisfy the\
    \ needs of her/his students.  \n \nPart I: The Fundamentals: Introduction to Effective\
    \ Decision Making \n \nThe objective here is to explore the duality of the decision-making\
    \ process, which is partly science and partly art. \nDifferent concepts of rationality\
    \ and the resulting approaches are discussed in general terms, ranging from \n\
    normative rational view to anarchistic and heuristic views. \n \nPart II: Rational\
    \ Models with Qualitative Methods and Analysis \n \nThe main theme here is to\
    \ cover the development of rational models based on forecasting and regression\
    \ techniques. \n \nPart III: Rational Models with Quantitative Methods and Analysis\
    \ \n \nThis section covers methods based on probability theory, such as decision\
    \ trees and related decision analysis and \nqueuing theory. \n \nPart IV: Holistic\
    \ Decision Models \n \nThis part starts with the Fundamentals of Systems Thinking\
    \ and provides an introduction to soft system \nmethodologies. Some case studies\
    \ will be discussed to demonstrate the strengths of system thinking-based decision\
    \ \nmaking. Selection of case studies and the methodology or methodologies will\
    \ depend on the instructor’s choice.  \n \nPart V: Optional Material \n \nHeuristic\
    \ Decision Making and Group Decision Making: This section includes the fundamentals\
    \ of decision making \napproaches that emphasize cognitive, heuristic, and group\
    \ behavior aspects (Pownall, 2012).  \n \nKnowledge Management and Decision Enhancing\
    \ Decision Making (Optional): The objective in this section is to \nteach the\
    \ fundamentals of knowledge management concepts, and (intelligent) decision support\
    \ systems, together \nwith the relevant IT. The technological aspects of this\
    \ topic may be found at (Muller, et. al., 2014), (Khan, et. .al. \n2014), (Laudon,\
    \ et.al, 2013) and (Kendall, et. al. 2011).         \n \nThe syllabus of the new\
    \ course designed in this study is as follows: \n \nCourse Code and Title: IEN\

    24 \nThe Clute Institute \nCourse Objectives: The aim in this course is to teach\
    \ systems thinking-based decision making techniques in complex \nsituations. First,\
    \ major systems concepts are covered, followed by a discussion of the basics of\
    \ systems thinking. \nNext, a comparative view of hard and soft systems thinking,\
    \ issues in methodology selection and an overview of \nCritical Systems Thinking\
    \ are presented. The rest of the course is dedicated to discussion of case studies\
    \ where \ndecision making takes place in complex environments. Most of the case\
    \ studies presented make use of System \nDynamics approach where hard and soft\
    \ modeling approaches are combined \n \nLearning Objectives: (1) To develop a\
    \ satisfactory background in systems thinking and soft systems thinking; (2) to\
    \ \nlearn major system concepts; (3) To learn how to develop the description of\
    \ a complex decision making situation in \na system context; (3) How to develop\
    \ a model of a complex situation via hard and soft modeling approaches;(4) \n\
    How to produce a decision via an appropriate system methodology or methodologies.\

    \ \nIn any methodology, problem structuring or description of the problematic\
    \ situation is a very important step. The \ndecision maker needs to know the major\
    \ system concepts to develop a satisfactory description of the problematic \n\
    situation. The important system concepts such as system boundary, types of systems\
    \ and models (discrete \n/continouos \nsystems, \ndeterministic/stochastic \n\
    systems, \nlinear/non-linear \nsystems, \nclosed/open \nsystems), \nfeedforward/feedback\
    \ loops, open-loop/closed-loop control mechanisms, transient/steady-state behavior,\
    \ emergent \nbehavior, system hierarchies and system response lags are covered\
    \ early in the course. Students need to understand \nthe diagrams shown in Figure\
    \ 2.a and 2.b; they provide a comparison of problem structuring by the hard OR\
    \ \nmethodology and Systems Thinking (Daellanbach, 2005). While System S (the\
    \ narrow system of interest) and \nSystem M (the modeling system) are separate\
    \ in the hard OR methodology, System S is defined within System M in \nthe soft\
    \ approaches. This makes a significant difference in problem structuring or problem\
    \ formulation, suggesting \nthat soft systems approaches have a better chance\
    \ of being successful. The reader should also note the inputs used in \nthe definition\
    \ of System S. In addition to boundary judgments, controllable and uncontrollable\
    \ inputs, similar to case \nin the hard OR methodology, there is a richer group\
    \ of inputs in the soft systems approach. Inputs such as \ntechnology, facilitation,\
    \ problem structuring, reflective thinking and commitment for action allow the\
    \ decision \nmaker to capture the problematic situation in its full system context.\
    \  \n \nSeveral tools such as mind maps, rich picture diagrams, and cognitive\
    \ maps will also be taught in the course are \navailable for structuring a problematic\
    \ situation. Good problem structuring requires good system boundary selection,\
    \ \nwhich fixes the scope, providing direction and focus for all subsequent analysis.\
    \  Poor boundary selection may have \nserious consequences, particularly as far\
    \ as people affected by the decision and the resources involved. Furthermore,\
    \ \na holistic perspective given in Figure 2.b allows the decision makers to see\
    \ unplanned and counterintuitive outcomes \nwith relative ease and help to evaluate\
    \ the consequences. \n \nIn the modeling section, students will learn how to include\
    \ soft indicators together with hard indicators (key \nperformance indicators\
    \ or critical success factors). The soft indicators include such things as morale,\
    \ commitment, \nburnout, care for customers and capacity for learning. Last but\
    \ not the least, system simulation is certainly one of the \npowerful tools for\
    \ conducting what-if analysis to make a good decision. Simulation models based\
    \ on System \nDynamics methodology are very popular in policy analysis, and in\
    \ scenario and strategy development. There are \nquite a number of successful\
    \ applications of the System Dynamics methodolgy in complex ecological systems,\

    \ large-scale healthcare systems (Maani, et.al., 2007, Aelker, et.al, 2013, Mingers,\
    \ et.al. 2010, \nYurtseven, et.al, 2012). \n \nIn short, the hard OR/MS paradigm\
    \ needs to be complemented by soft system approaches in university education.\
    \ \nThis will broaden the vision of students and help them handle complex decision\
    \ problems with confidence. Soft \nmethodologies cover a wide range of approaches\
    \ that hard methodologies cannot capture. This new course has not \nbeen taught\
    \ in the form as described here yet. It will be offered in the coming academic\
    \ year. However, a positive \nresponse was received from the fourth year industrial\
    \ engineering students when some material on system life cycle \nmodels in the\
    \ Fundamentals of Systems Engineering course was replaced by the introductory\
    \ material of this \nproposed course (items #1to 5 in the new syllabus). The objective\
    \ of Fundamentals of Systems Engineering is to \nteach the analysis and design\
    \ of industrial and socio-economic systems. It is compulsory and the remaining\
    \ part of \nthe course is based on the applications of system dynamics methodology.\
    \ It is believed that students’ positive \nresponse to the change was primarily\
    \ related to its relevance. They were able to integrate this material into industrial\
    \ \nengineering profession as opposed to the fairly abstract material on system\
    \ life-cycle methodology. Surely this \ninitial information is not sufficient\
    \ to judge whether the new approach is more or less successful. Like any other\
    \ new \ncourse, particularly if it is not a conventional one, it has to be taught\
    \ at least three times to measure its educational \neffectiveness. The results\
    \ from the second offer of the course may not also be fully reliable since there\
    \ tends to be \nsome minor changes after the first offer. The next phase in this\
    \ research work is to redesign the Socio-Technical \nSystem Design course accordingly.\
    \ This is an elective course. Highly likely this course will be primarily based\
    \ on \nSoft Systems Methodology. \n  \nFigure 2a. Structure diagram for hard OR\

    A new framework was developed and a new course was designed for teaching decision\
    \ making to undergraduate \nstudents in this study. It was argued that the traditional\
    \ or hard OR/MS paradigm is adequate for handling simple \nand structured decision\
    \ making problems, but insufficient in complex situations. This weakness was overcome\
    \ by \nexpanding the traditional framework to include systems thinking-based methodologies.\
    \ It was further argued that, \nthrough Systems Thinking, and through some soft\
    \ methodologies, it is possible to develop a rich and a structured \ndescription\
    \ of a messy problematic situation. This approach will help students in describing\
    \ a complex problematic \nsituation in a system context, and developing a satisficing\
    \ decision through consensus within a pluralist environment \n- they will not\
    \ be searching for an optimal solution for a simplified version of the complex\
    \ reality. Future research \nwill be directed towards measuring the degree of\
    \ success of the new course in industrial engineering education via \nthe learning\

    How much is enough in watering

    plants? State-of-the-art in

    irrigation control: Advances,

    challenges, and opportunities

    With a rapidly expanding global population placing an ever growing demand on

    freshwater resources, an increased focus on irrigation techniques tailored to
    the

    speciﬁc needs of plant appears as one solution to minimize overall freshwater

    consumption. Precision irrigation methods seek to realize an acceptable

    compromise

    between

    yield

    and

    irrigation

    water consumption

    through

    control of the timing and quantity of water supplied to plants. The goal is to

    maintain the water content of the soil, achieve speciﬁc water use efﬁciency with

    regard to yield or maintain the physiological response of the plant to water

    stress within predetermined limits. Reliance on soil moisture measurements to

    establish irrigation water demand inadequately addresses heterogenous

    distribution of water in soil. Growing research interest is observed detailing

    the determination of plant water status directly from physiological responses.

    This paper reviews irrigation control approaches based on different plant water

    status assessment techniques. A distinct focus is made on application scale of

    the discussed control approaches, an aspect that has not been considered

    intensively enough in previous discussions of irrigation control approaches. A

    discussion of the observed strengths and shortcomings and technological

    advances supporting the various methods used to quantify plant water status

    extends the review. Emerging trends that are likely to have an impact on plant

    water status determination and optimal timing and quantiﬁcation of irrigation

    water requirements are integrated to show latest results. A peek into the future

    of precision irrigation foresees greater reliance on plant-based signals, both
    in

    characterization of the control variable, namely the plant water status, and in

    generation of controller outputs in terms of quantity and timing.

    1 Introduction

    As the world advances further into the 21st century, a rapidly

    growing global population continues to exert greater demand on

    agricultural food production (van Dijk et al., 2021). The effects of

    climate change provide an additional challenge to traditional

    rain- and reservoir-based crop production, making the case for

    use of irrigation either exclusively throughout the growing

    season, or as a supplement to natural precipitation (Wada

    et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2020). Maintaining crop yields from

    the available land area, using a diminishing quantity of the

    required freshwater for irrigation is a delicate balancing act

    that has acted as a motivation for extensive research in

    precision irrigation approaches, with the overall goal of

    maximizing water use efﬁciency of irrigated crops, while

    simultaneously meeting the rising global food demand.

    While water treatment and desalination provide alternatives

    to cover the freshwater need, existing techniques are costly and

    energy intensive, particularly at low to medium scale (Arborea

    et al., 2017; Hagenvoort et al., 2019; Arena et al., 2020;

    Oubelkacem et al., 2020; Ofori et al., 2021). Concerns about

    the safety of treated wastewater, even with application of

    advanced treatment methods, have resulted in a call to more

    rigorous regulation and combination of treatment processes

    (Rizzo et al., 2020). Freshwater generation via atmospheric

    water harvesting (Tu et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2022) offers a

    novel, but energy intensive alternative which is currently

    limited to smaller production units (LaPotin et al., 2021). As a

    conclusion optimization of crop irrigation appears to be the most

    suitable solution to achieve a sustainable compromise between

    increasing freshwater demand for food production and the

    associated energy and environmental costs to realize adequate

    global food supply.

    In the history of mankind, adequate food production has

    been a fundamental requirement in the growth and advancement

    of human society. As early as 5000 BC, early agricultural

    civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia had come upon the

    idea of expanding the extent of arable land through use of

    irrigation, making use of the ﬂoodwaters of the Nile, Tigris,

    and Euphrates which was diverted into arable farmlands

    bordering the rivers through an extensive network of canals

    (Bazza, 2007). Through the use of intricate systems of canals,

    with later additions of reservoirs, dikes, and overﬂow canals,

    ﬂooding could be mitigated (Grenfell et al., 1900; Westermann,

    1919). Similar implementation of surface irrigation was also

    recorded in ancient China, Crete, India, and Persia (Biswas,

    1970). Irrigation control in this case was focused on direction

    of irrigation water to speciﬁc locations, regulation of irrigation

    duration and mitigation of ﬂooding. Surface irrigation methods

    involving use of ﬂooded basins, furrows, dykes, dams, and

    artiﬁcial reservoirs remain the predominant form of irrigation

    to date (Jägermeyr et al., 2015). Control methods aimed at more

    efﬁcient use of irrigation water have been targeted at regulating

    the timing, duration, and frequency of supply to the ﬁelds

    through control of gates, sluices, valves, and pumps.

    Introduction of new methods of water application to

    plants in the ﬁeld, namely through sprinklers and drip

    lines, provided new opportunities for more accurate control

    of irrigation water supply, allowing the regulation of water

    supply down to the individual plant level. These developments

    on the actuation side of irrigation have been accompanied by

    corresponding

    developments

    in

    sensing

    and

    control

    approaches.

    The incorporation of spatial variability in the management of

    irrigation is a key concept in distinguishing between traditional

    irrigation and precision irrigation (Sadler et al., 2005; Smith and

    Baillie, 2009). In Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2010), a distinction is

    made between traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation,

    which

    focus

    on

    maximizing

    efﬁciency

    through

    precise

    determination of volume, location and timing of irrigation,

    with uniform application over the entire system, and an

    updated deﬁnition that incorporates spatial and temporal

    variation in irrigation treatment. The focus is shifted from

    ﬁeld level to management zones within the ﬁeld (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2014; Fernández, 2017), or to individual plant

    level (Kizer et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2018). Camp et al.

    describe

    precision

    irrigation

    as

    “site-speciﬁc

    water

    management, speciﬁcally the application of water to a given

    site in a volume and at a time needed for optimum crop

    production, proﬁtability, or other management objectives at

    that speciﬁc site” (Camp et al., 2006). In this review, the

    supporting technologies are considered with regard to their

    ﬂexibility in allowing variable precision irrigation of individual

    plants or zones, rather than achieving efﬁciency through

    generation of uniform irrigation schedules.

    Traditional deﬁnitions of precision irrigation consider the

    “precise amount” of water to be applied to be the full amount of

    water required to meet the plant demand, which has commonly

    been determined based on the relationship between crop

    evapotranspiration and environmental factors (Morillo et al.,

    2015; Morales et al., 2016). Current irrigation practices that

    explore the cultivation of irrigated crops under regulated

    water deﬁcit provide a new Frontier for precision irrigation,

    where the required amount to be delivered is determined with a

    goal of avoiding irreversible water stress damage, without

    necessarily

    fully

    matching

    evapotranspiration-based

    plant

    demands. This provides further avenues for improvement of

    water use efﬁciency. Deﬁcit irrigation-based applications of

    precision irrigation approaches have been employed in control

    of both pre- and post-harvest yield quality (Pérez-Pastor et al.,

    2007; Lipan et al., 2019; Venturi et al., 2021). The observed effect

    of deﬁcit irrigation approaches on crop maturation (Zegbe-

    Domínguez et al., 2003; Cui et al., 2008) is an additional

    research target, with the possibility to enhance economic

    outcomes for the farmer by matching harvest timing to

    periods of greatest market demand. In this review, precision

    irrigation control approaches incorporating regulated water

    deﬁcit are emphasized.

    Previous

    contributions

    in

    the

    review

    of

    precision

    irrigation

    approaches

    have

    addressed

    model-based

    and

    sensor-based monitoring (Adeyemi et al., 2017; Liang et al.,

    2020; Plaščak et al., 2021; Bwambale et al., 2022), speciﬁc

    control algorithms applied in irrigation scheduling (Romero

    et al., 2012; Abioye et al., 2022), and technological advances

    supporting future development in precision irrigation control

    (Neupane and Guo, 2019; Bodkhe et al., 2020; Han et al.,

    2020).

    This

    review

    similarly

    provide

    a

    comprehensive

    summary of monitoring, control, and actuation approaches

    applied in precision irrigation control. Additionally, the

    implementability of deﬁcit irrigation-based strategies for

    increased water use efﬁciency is addressed, allowing the

    extension of achievable water savings thus contributing to

    sustainable expansion of global food production without

    exhausting available freshwater resources.

    2 Precision irrigation control

    approaches

    Control techniques are broadly classiﬁed as open or closed

    loop, deﬁning the existence of any kind of calculated or otherwise

    technically realized feedback (output to the input of the system

    considered). Open loop precision irrigation control relies on an

    accurate understanding (in the best case: a model) of plant water

    requirements, while closed loop methods include sensing

    mechanisms to dynamically adjust the control input to the

    irrigation system based on measured values.

    The performance of precision irrigation control approaches

    depends on the deﬁnition of plant water requirements. The

    characterization of plant water demand and the subsequent

    responses to the water application is described in Kögler

    (Kögler and Söffker, 2017) along a soil-plant-atmosphere

    continuum.

    This

    paper

    similarly

    groups

    approaches

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    into

    soil-based,

    plant-based,

    and

    atmosphere-based approaches. Further distinction is made

    between approaches targeted at enhancing precise delivery at

    ﬁeld level, within irrigation management zones and at individual

    plant level.

    2.1 Soil-based approaches

    Growing plants obtain water required for their growth from

    the soil. The soil moisture content has therefore been applied as a

    measure of the water status of the plant, with a plant-speciﬁc

    lower limit describing the minimum moisture content required

    to maintain the plant above wilting point (Briggs and Shantz,

    1911) and a soil-speciﬁc maximum water holding capacity, also

    referred to as the ﬁeld capacity (Veihmeyer and Hendrickson,

    1931). The main goal of traditional irrigation methods is to

    maintain soil moisture content at ﬁeld capacity during the

    growth phases, with scheduling of irrigation events based on

    plant growth models such as FAO Aquacrop (Steduto et al., 2009)

    or multivariable models simulating soil moisture, plant growth,

    and evapotranspiration such as DSSAT (Hoogenboom et al.,

    2019).

    Model-based predictive control approaches applied in

    precision irrigation allow the integration of soil moisture

    models

    in

    a

    predictive

    control

    scheme,

    which

    allows

    forecasting of moisture content and update of control actions

    based on measured variables. Spatial and temporal variability is

    accounted for using regression models (Hedley C. and Yule I.,

    2009), a predictive model with weekly measurement-based

    updates performing online optimization (Nahar et al., 2019),

    employment of Kalman ﬁlters (Roy, 2014), and application of

    deep belief networks and macroscopic cellular automata, with

    dynamic environmental measurements providing additional data

    for prediction (Song et al., 2016).

    The learning capabilities of neural networks allows the

    adaptation of plant growth models for the design of precision

    irrigation controllers. Speciﬁc neural-network based approaches

    allow online updating of control decisions based on measured

    real-time conditions, resulting in more accurate behavior. These

    capabilities are utilized by Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) in

    the development of an adaptive closed loop controller that allows

    for

    modiﬁcation

    of

    control

    actions

    when

    environmental

    perturbations such as rainfall or extreme temperatures cause a

    change in irrigation requirements. Long short term memory

    neural networks are employed for prediction of soil moisture

    content (Adeyemi et al., 2018) or soil matric potential Jimenez

    et al. (2020) with varying performance, both in terms of water

    savings and prediction accuracy. These are attributed to soil

    characteristics and duration of the prediction window. Difference

    in performance of neural network-based predictive models are

    also reported by (Gu et al., 2021), with larger estimation errors

    observed at lower soil moisture content levels, affecting

    performance of the precision irrigation scheduling system.

    A major challenge in the use of model-based methods for

    precision irrigation is that the control performance is limited by

    the accuracy of prediction or estimation achieved by the model.

    Incorporation of soil moisture data into irrigation management

    decisions offers a signiﬁcant performance improvement in soil-

    based precision irrigation approaches. Sensor readings have been

    used to calibrate and reﬁne model output, as described in (Tseng

    et al., 2018), where soil moisture measurements are used in

    labelling images acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle for

    training a deep learning-based predictive algorithm. Conversely,

    application of predictive models can be integrated in sensor-

    based control approaches to reduce the quantity of sensor

    readings required to make an accurate assessment of soil

    water content, as proposed in (De Benedetto et al., 2013b)

    and (Andugula et al., 2017).

    Owino and Söffker

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    Soil-based closed loop control methods integrate soil

    moisture measurements in the control loop. On/off switching

    algorithms triggered by designated soil moisture sensors with

    preset static thresholds have been employed in precision

    irrigation control by Xiao et al. (Xiao et al., 2010). Use of

    dynamic switching thresholds allows real-time response to

    ﬁeld

    conditions,

    with

    the

    adaptation

    of

    the

    thresholds

    accomplished in Capraro et al. (Capraro et al., 2008) by

    neural networks, and numerical simulation employed by Egea

    et al. (Egea et al., 2017). An alternative approach involves

    placement of sensors at varying depths to track inﬁltration

    rate, allowing anticipatory switching (Benzekri and Refouﬁ,

    2006; Zhao et al., 2007; Liu and Xu, 2018).

    Development of a large variety of soil moisture sensors with

    greater accuracy and reliability has facilitated the precision

    control of irrigation based on real-time conditions. A major

    challenge to implementation of sensor-based control approaches

    has been the unit cost of sensors, which limits the economic

    viability of ﬁeld scale application of appropriately accurate and

    precise sensors. New low-cost soil moisture sensors have been

    developed in recent times based on sensing approaches

    commonly used in commercially available sensors, including

    frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR) (Xiao et al., 2010),

    time

    domain

    reﬂectometry

    (TDR)

    (Wei

    et

    al.,

    2013),

    impedance

    spectroscopy

    (Umar

    and

    Setiadi,

    2015),

    and

    capacitance-based methods (Kojima et al., 2016; Gao et al.,

    2018). Novel approaches in the measurement of soil moisture

    content have also been developed in recent times, such as a time-

    domain multiplexing approach described in Saeed et al. (Saeed

    et al., 2019) and a high frequency double-resonance tuning

    approach developed by Qinglan et al. (Qinglan et al., 2020).

    Ding and Chandra introduce a Wi-Fi-based measurement

    system that relies on radio-frequency propagation (Ding and

    Chandra, 2019). Development of more precise calibration

    techniques and incorporation of fault detection mechanisms

    generates an opportunity for improvement of measurement

    accuracy and ﬂexibility of application in both novel and

    existing soil moisture sensors (Oates et al., 2016; Chen L.

    et al., 2019; González-Teruel et al., 2019; Nagahage et al.,

    2019). Additionally, dynamically variable irrigation thresholds

    based on plant growth requirements can be incorporated through

    calibration based on plant measurements. This is employed in

    Lou et al. (Lou et al., 2016) to generate a set of soil potential

    thresholds that allows precision irrigation through different plant

    growth stages.

    Location and distribution of moisture sensors within the ﬁeld

    has traditionally relied on expert knowledge from manufacturers

    or farmers. Approaches for optimizing the spatial distribution of

    soil moisture sensors for improved mapping of water content

    include use of clay percentile (Zhao W. et al., 2017), analysis of

    soil elevation maps combined with measurement of electrical

    conductivity (Adamchuk et al., 2010), and application of graph-

    theoretical methods (Roy, 2014).

    Field level precision irrigation based on soil moisture content

    relies on accurately modeling and/or measurement of soil water

    dynamics, incorporating the effects of precipitation, irrigation,

    leaching, run-off, and drainage to establish the moisture available

    within the root zone of the plant. Precision irrigation control

    approaches are therefore employed primarily to address accuracy

    of moisture content measurement and monitoring, and the

    scheduling the timing and quantity of ﬁeld-level irrigation

    events. Remote sensing techniques capable of extracting soil

    moisture characteristics with increasing precision and more

    frequent intervals is a key factor in the further development

    of soil-based precision irrigation at ﬁeld level. Electromagnetic

    surveys have been applied in (Hedley et al., 2013) to assess the

    spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture and water table depth

    for precision irrigation control. Satellite data are also used to

    determine the soil water index, which is used as an indicator of

    soil moisture content (Termite et al., 2019).

    Zone level precision irrigation relies on accurate demarcation

    of the ﬁeld into homogeneous management zones based on

    physical and chemical characteristics of the soil (Bazzi et al.,

    2018; de Lara et al., 2018; Chen S. et al., 2019). Integration of

    plant-related

    measurements

    to

    complement

    soil

    sensor

    measurements has been explored in (Rojo et al., 2016; Ortuani

    et al., 2019; Vera et al., 2019; Serrano et al., 2020) for better zone

    delineation as a means to increasing irrigation efﬁciency. Recent

    research investigates the adoption of Bayesian maximum entropy

    (Han et al., 2020) and clustering approaches (Haghverdi et al.,

    2015; Oldoni and Bassoi, 2016; Ohana-Levi et al., 2019; Javadi

    et al., 2022) for achievement of optional zoning. To address

    challenges arising from static management zone delineation

    based on spatial characterization, dynamic determination of

    zone boundaries has been explored with integration of real-

    time soil and plant sensor measurements (Scudiero et al.,

    2018;

    Fontanet

    et

    al.,

    2020)

    or

    use

    of

    deep

    learning

    approaches (Song et al., 2016).

    With regard to the current status of soil-based precision

    irrigation control approaches summarized in Table 1, it can be

    stated that the maintenance of soil moisture level between a user-

    deﬁned lower boundary related to the wilting point and an upper

    boundary deﬁned by the soil water capacity has been employed as

    the basis for control decisions. Challenges related to soil water

    dynamics arising from inherent hydraulic characteristics or

    changes in the spatial envelope deﬁning root-available water

    have been addressed. Optimization of location and distribution

    of soil moisture sensors to allow accurate mapping of soil

    moisture distribution while minimizing the required number

    of sensors is a potential area for further work in the

    implementation

    of

    sensor-supported

    soil-based

    precision

    irrigation control. Variations in the upper soil moisture

    boundary during scheduling of irrigation quantity has not

    been

    considered

    in

    literature,

    signifying

    a

    gap

    in

    the

    application of soil-based precision irrigation methods to

    deﬁcit irrigation strategies. Additionally, a signiﬁcant gap

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    exists in soil-based approaches applied at individual plant level.

    Advancements in the ﬁeld of wireless sensor networks, remote

    sensing and machine learning approaches are expected to drive

    future developments in soil-based precision irrigation control,

    allowing for more localized decision support systems and greater

    adaptability to individual plant water requirements.

    2.2 Atmosphere-based approaches

    Atmosphere-based precision irrigation control approaches

    involve balancing the water supplied to the plant with the water

    released

    to

    the

    atmosphere

    through

    evapotranspiration.

    Achievement of the high accuracy required in precision

    irrigation

    is

    either

    accomplished

    by

    reﬁning

    evapotranspiration models for use in open loop control or by

    incorporation of sensor feedback in closed loop control.

    Common models of evapotranspiration incorporated into

    precision irrigation include FAO’s Penman-Monteith model

    (Allen, 1998; Fourati et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2017;

    Pereira

    et

    al.,

    2020),

    the

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985; Gordin et al., 2019; Pelosi

    et al., 2019; Domínguez-Niño et al., 2020) and the Surface

    Energy Balance model (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998;

    Gobbo

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Both

    the

    Penman-Monteith

    and

    Hargreaves-Samani models generate an estimated reference

    evapotranspiration rate, which is multiplied by a crop-speciﬁc

    coefﬁcient to predict the actual evapotranspiration rate of the

    crop.

    The

    Hargreaves-Samani

    model

    provides

    a

    simpler

    approach due to its ability to provide an estimate based solely

    on temperature values, as compared to the Penman-Monteith

    approach, where several environmental, geographic and soil-

    related variables are required. Better temporal stability in

    evapotranspiration prediction accuracy using the Hargreaves-

    Samani approach has also been reported in (Lorite et al., 2015),

    making it a more reliable option for control approaches

    integrating longer prediction windows. The SEBAL approach

    directly computes the actual evapotranspiration rate from

    thermal imagery without requiring speciﬁc soil- or crop-

    related coefﬁcients, making it more readily applicable to new

    or inadequately researched crop varieties for which physiological

    coefﬁcients are yet to be established.

    Machine learning approaches have more recently been

    applied in estimation of evapotranspiration, and hence plant

    water requirements, based on weather data (Sidhu et al., 2020;

    Farooque et al., 2021). Linker et al. use temperature forecasts to

    estimate evapotranspiration values, which are applied in

    precision scheduling of irrigation to achieve targeted optimal

    combinations of yield and irrigation amount selected by the

    farmer (Linker et al., 2018). Estimation of evapotranspiration

    using remote sensing data is employed in Barker et al. (Barker

    et al., 2018) for variable rate irrigation control. In Ma et al., the

    Root Zone Water Quality Model is calibrated using lysimeter

    measurements for estimation of plant evapotranspiration, which

    is then applied in irrigation scheduling (Ma et al., 2017). The

    authors suggest further improvement of irrigation scheduling by

    inclusion of weather forecasting data. Improvements in water use

    efﬁciency are observed in this case. However, due to the

    implementation

    of

    an

    open-loop

    control,

    real-time

    evapotranspiration values play no role in the decision-making,

    making the system susceptible to environmental variations. For

    greenhouse-based applications (Incrocci et al., 2014), developed a

    data-driven evapotranspiration model for precision irrigation

    control, achieving a 45% reduction in seasonal water use.

    An

    alternative

    atmospheric-based

    approach

    relies

    on

    prediction of precipitation rather than evapotranspiration

    (Roy,

    2014;

    Tsakmakis

    et

    al.,

    2016).

    Roy

    introduces

    a

    stochastic

    weather

    forecasting

    module

    for

    predicting

    precipitation (Roy, 2014) using publicly available weather

    forecasts. Tsakmakis et al. use a weather prognostics model

    based on the air pollution model (Hurley, 2005), which

    predicts

    precipitation

    by

    solving

    given

    scalar

    equations.

    Irrigation scheduling is adjusted based on predicted timing

    and quantities of precipitation.

    Hybrid approaches combining ET estimation with soil

    moisture sensing (Lozoya et al., 2016; Nocco et al., 2019;

    Bhatti et al., 2020) or plant-based methods (Tsakmakis et al.,

    2016; Gobbo et al., 2019) have also been used to achieve greater

    accuracy

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control.

    These

    allow

    compensation

    of

    weather-related

    disturbances

    to

    the

    evapotranspiration model by integrating the dynamic behavior

    of soil moisture or of the plant. However their reliability depends

    on the accuracy of crop coefﬁcients used in determination of

    actual evapotranspiration.

    A major challenge in atmospheric-based precision irrigation

    approaches arises from the difﬁculty in differentiating between

    evaporation (from the soil surface) and transpiration (from the

    plants), requiring dynamic adjustment of irrigation control

    algorithms as plant cover increases during the growth season.

    A recent approach described by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2020)

    involves the partitioning of evapotranspiration values into its two

    components through machine learning techniques. This could

    provide a key to achieving greater accuracy in precision irrigation

    control, allowing the focusing of water delivery to meet actual

    plant demand rather than maintaining constant soil moisture

    levels, including in areas where no plant growth is present. A

    summary of existing atmosphere-based control approaches is

    provided in Table 2.

    2.3 Plant-based approaches

    To alleviate the gaps inherent in soil-based and atmospheric-

    based precision control approaches, plant-based precision

    irrigation control has been widely seen as the best approach

    in accurately determining and meeting plant water requirements

    (Jones, 2004). The timing and quantity of irrigation is based on

    the plant physiological response to lack of water, which results in

    changes in leaf surface temperature, water potential, or turgor

    (Ayars and Phene, 2007).

    Canopy temperature-based crop water stress indices (CWSI),

    both based on theoretical (Idso et al., 1981) and experimental

    models (Jackson et al., 1981) have been employed in irrigation

    scheduling since the early 1980s. Due to their reliance on canopy

    temperature measurements taken at a speciﬁc time of day

    (typically midday), they are constrained in their adaptability

    to dynamically varying stress conditions. Applications of

    CWSI

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    control

    are

    described

    in

    O’Shaughnessy et al. (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012b), where a

    cumulative

    time

    threshold

    is

    incorporated

    in

    the

    determination of irrigation timing, and in Osroosh et al.

    (Osroosh

    et

    al.,

    2015),

    where

    a

    dynamic

    threshold

    is

    implemented to account for changes in water stress thresholds

    at different growing stages. A recent approach described by

    Andrade et al. (Andrade et al., 2018) is the implementation of

    machine learning algorithms for forecasting of crop water stress

    indices based on historic data.

    Advancements in canopy temperature measurements have

    contributed greatly to the development of plant-based precision

    irrigation approaches. High resolution satellite thermal images

    have been used for mapping of plant water stress levels for site-

    speciﬁc irrigation scheduling, with the capability to replace

    locally obtained leaf water potential (LWP) measurements

    (Meron et al., 2010). At a local level, thermal imagery

    obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Gonzalez-

    Dugo et al., 2013; Martínez et al., 2016; Matese et al., 2018) or

    all-terrain vehicles moving within the irrigated ﬁeld (Gutiérrez

    et al., 2018) has been used in mapping of plant water

    requirements for generation of irrigation management zones.

    At plant level, surface temperature sensors mounted on

    individual leaves have been applied to allow continuous

    monitoring of stress status (Rojo et al., 2016; Kizer et al., 2018).

    Determination of plant water status by measurement of water

    potential in a pressure chamber was ﬁrst described by Dixon and

    Joly in 1895 (Dixon and Joly, 1895). Various approaches have

    been developed for determination of water potential, with

    measurements taken either from the leaves or from the stem

    (SWP). Water potential measurement is done either directly on

    the plant (Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016; Blanco-Cipollone et al.,

    2017) or estimated from multispectral imagery (Baluja et al.,

    2012; Zhao T. et al., 2017; Beeri et al., 2018; Helman et al., 2018;

    Tung et al., 2018). Precision irrigation control approaches based

    on use of plant water potential-based thresholds for triggering of

    irrigation events are described by (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010;

    Bellvert et al., 2015; Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016) and (Ruiz-

    Sánchez et al., 2018). The application of machine learning

    approaches enables integration of historical water potential

    measurements

    to

    predict

    spatial

    variations

    in

    water

    requirements, as described in (Pôças et al., 2020). An

    alternative method

    involves the use of

    water potential

    thresholds

    as

    the

    standard

    for

    calibration

    of

    other

    measurement approaches, such as trunk diameter shrinkage

    and growth rate (Livellara et al., 2011). Near infra-red

    spectroscopy

    measurements

    have

    also

    been

    applied

    in

    precision irrigation control, as described by (Diago et al., 2018).

    Water is required for the maintenance of turgor pressure

    in plants. Plant water status can therefore be monitored or

    measured through measurement of turgor. Developments

    related

    to

    leaf

    turgor

    measurements

    and

    potential

    application

    in

    precision

    irrigation

    are

    described

    in

    (Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2016; Rodriguez-Dominguez et al.,

    2019). A novel approach employing ultrasonic sensing

    techniques for determination of leaf water content as

    related to turgor pressure is described in (Álvarez-Arenas

    et

    al.,

    2016),

    allowing

    for

    non-contact

    application

    of

    turgor-based precision irrigation control.

    Other emerging methods of assessing plant water status that

    could provide useful feedback for precision irrigation control

    include measurement of leaf thickness (Seelig et al., 2011), trunk

    diameter (Conejero et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2017), leaf reﬂectance

    (Katsoulas et al., 2016) and various applications of image analysis

    (Hendrawan and Murase, 2009; Chen et al., 2018; Mateo-Aroca

    et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). The demarcation of irrigation

    management zones based on plant-based sensors is also a

    potential area of exploration (Bazzi et al., 2018), allowing the

    realization of zone-based irrigation control that better matches

    the plant water requirements.

    In general, while plant-based approaches (summarized in

    Table 3) provide the closest match to plant water requirements,

    there still exist open questions regarding the determination of

    appropriate

    irrigation

    quantity,

    the

    distinguishing

    of

    physiological responses to water stress from other stresses,

    and the dynamic adaptation of irrigation control to account

    for physiological coping mechanisms employed by plants in

    response to water stress.

    The interaction between the soil, plant and atmosphere

    provides a broad spectrum of combinations for precision

    irrigation control approaches. Selection of a suitable approach

    depends

    on

    the

    speciﬁc

    soil,

    plant

    and

    environmental

    characteristics under consideration, as well as the desired scale

    of application. While signiﬁcant progress has been made in

    development of ﬁeld-level and zone-based precision irrigation

    applications using all three approaches, there remains a

    signiﬁcant gap in plant-level precision irrigation control,

    which has the potential to further improve the efﬁciency of

    irrigation water supply to meet actual plant demand.

    3 Advances in precision irrigation

    The development of precision irrigation control has beneﬁted

    from technological advances in various ﬁelds. In this section, the

    technological advances contributing to precision irrigation

    control are discussed under three main categories: sensor

    development and data acquisition, data processing and control

    approaches, and actuating devices. Speciﬁc elements of Industry

    4.0 are directly addressed in each section.

    3.1 Advances in sensing

    3.1.1 Remote sensing

    Greater availability of satellite data has provided a signiﬁcant

    boost to integration of remote sensor data in precision irrigation

    applications. The soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS)

    satellite (Kerr et al., 2010) launched by the European Space

    Agency and the soil moisture active and passive (SMAP)

    (Entekhabi et al., 2010) satellite by NASA have in particular

    been

    instrumental

    in

    furthering

    research

    on

    remote

    measurement and monitoring of soil water content. Drought

    assessment using soil water deﬁcit indices derived from SMOS

    Martínez-Fernández et al. (2016) and SMAP (Zhu et al., 2019)

    enables the tracking of changes in soil moisture content over

    time, enabling precision irrigation management. In (Brocca et al.,

    2018), satellite data are used to quantify amount of irrigation

    water supplied at various sites, demonstrating the potential of

    applying remote sensing data to monitoring and control tasks

    associated

    with

    precision

    irrigation.

    The

    challenge

    of

    downscaling regional scale satellite data for local application,

    such as in precision irrigation, is presented in (Peng et al., 2017),

    with a discussion of satellite-based, geoinformation-based, and

    model-base approaches. A key limitation of microwave satellites

    is that soil moisture information describes the surface condition

    rather

    than

    root

    zone

    characteristics.

    The

    Global

    Land

    Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) (Martens et al.,

    2017) provides a set of algorithms allowing estimation of

    root-zone soil moisture and evaporation from satellite data,

    allowing for incorporation into precision irrigation strategies.

    Termite et al. (Termite et al., 2019) describe the harnessing of

    machine learning capabilities in analysis of satellite imagery to

    predict soil moisture dynamics for application in irrigation

    decision support systems.

    3.1.2 Wireless sensor networks

    Advancements in wireless sensor network technology have

    led to improved collection and analysis of sensor data for high

    resolution mapping of soil moisture (Zhao et al., 2007; Xiao

    et al., 2010; Hedley et al., 2013). Real-time communication

    between

    sensors,

    actuators,

    and

    human

    users

    is

    easily

    achievable

    over

    locally

    available

    telecommunications

    infrastructure and interfaces can be implemented on mobile

    hand-held devices (Işık et al., 2017). An expansion of sensor

    networking has seen the rise of Internet-of-Things-based

    sensing applied for monitoring of plant water requirements,

    whether via soil-based, atmosphere-based, or plant-based

    measurements (Vasisht et al., 2017; Goap et al., 2018; Munir

    et al., 2018). Integration of wireless sensor networks has also

    found

    application

    in

    dynamic

    delineation

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    for

    zone-based

    precision

    irrigation

    control in Sapna et al. (Sapna et al., 2020).

    3.2 Advances in data processing and

    control

    3.2.1 Big data

    The vast quantities of data generated from networked sensors

    generate a need for expanded processing and storage capabilities.

    In this respect, cloud computing approaches provide a viable

    solution, ﬁnding application in monitoring of real-time irrigation

    status (López-Riquelme et al., 2017; Vaishali et al., 2017) and

    modeling of plant water requirements for soil-based (Raikar

    et al., 2018; Mezouari et al., 2020), plant-based (Roopaei et al.,

    2017), and atmosphere-based (Bendre et al., 2015) precision

    irrigation control approaches. Data analysis techniques applied

    on Big Data applications are also proving beneﬁcial in

    management of precision irrigation control systems (Zhang

    et al., 2017).

    3.2.2 Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence

    Machine learning involves generation of self-modifying

    or

    adapting

    algorithms

    whose

    performance

    accuracy

    increases

    with

    experience

    (Marsland,

    2014).

    Machine

    learning techniques have been crucial in development of

    dynamic

    control

    approaches

    through

    integration

    of

    learning capabilities. Applications in the area of precision

    irrigation are primarily in predictive modeling of soil

    moisture dynamics (Hinnell et al., 2010; Adeyemi et al.,

    2018) and optimized irrigation scheduling (Jimenez et al.,

    2018;

    Murthy

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    Recent

    research

    involves

    application of Machine learning algorithms to identify new

    parameters that can be employed in characterization of plant

    water content, primarily through image analysis (Hendrawan

    and Murase, 2009).

    3.2.3 Multi-agent systems

    Multi-agent systems expand the capabilities of artiﬁcial

    intelligence by introducing multiple autonomous intelligent

    agents capable of interacting with each other. Multi-agent

    systems have been employed in simulation of plant growth

    response

    to

    multiple

    irrigation

    strategies,

    allowing

    the

    selection

    of

    optimal

    precision

    irrigation

    approaches

    for

    speciﬁc conditions (Isern et al., 2012; Belaqziz et al., 2013;

    Zaryouli et al., 2020). With the incorporation of real-time

    sensed

    variables

    describing

    plant

    response

    to

    water

    application,

    multi-agent

    systems

    have

    additionally

    been

    proposed

    for

    dynamic

    tuning

    of

    irrigation

    scheduling

    algorithms (Villarrubia et al., 2017; Wanyama and Far, 2017;

    González-Briones et al., 2019), allowing for constant adaptation

    of water supply to plant needs. Further research in incorporation

    of artiﬁcial intelligence in plant-based precision irrigation control

    could be useful in enabling further individualization of plant

    water requirement estimation, resulting in precision irrigation

    control applications that more closely meet individual plant

    needs.

    An emerging ﬁeld in precision irrigation control is the

    modeling

    of

    irrigation-related

    parameters

    using

    hybrid

    automata.

    Here,

    plant,

    soil,

    and

    atmosphere-related

    parameters are modeled using ﬁnite state-machines, with

    individual

    states

    described

    using

    simple

    linear

    models,

    enabling the modeling and control of complex dynamic

    systems, as described in Lozoya et al. (Lozoya et al., 2019) and

    Jihin et al. (Jihin et al., 2019). Future work in this area would

    involve integration of the generated plant models in precision

    irrigation control algorithms, with the aim of predicting plant

    water

    requirements

    and

    adaptively

    adjusting

    irrigation

    scheduling based on plant response.

    3.3 Advances in actuation

    Delivery of irrigation water involves control of suitable

    individual or combinations of pumps, valves, gates, and drip

    lines through connected actuators in the form of motors,

    mechanisms, and/or linkages. To ensure that the required

    amount of irrigation water is delivered in a timely manner to

    the required location, improvements at the delivery end play a

    signiﬁcant role. A common unifying factor is uniform supply of

    irrigation water, with precision control approaches mainly

    concerned with on/off switching of actuators to accomplish

    scheduling and determine irrigation quantity.

    3.3.1 Variable rate irrigation

    The achievement of precision irrigation requires variable

    delivery of water to different locations, based on localized

    requirements. The development of variable rate irrigation is

    described in Mulla and Khosla (Mulla and Khosla, 2015) as

    one of the major contributors to the widespread adoption of

    precision agriculture. In variable rate irrigation, the amount of

    water delivered by individual nozzles or groups of nozzles is

    independently adjustable, allowing for delineation of a ﬁeld into

    different irrigation management zones. This is a widely used

    approach in cases where variations in scheduling or frequency of

    irrigation for different zones within the ﬁeld may not be desired.

    Implementation of variable rate irrigation has been achieved by a

    number of researchers through modiﬁcation of commercially

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    Owino and Söffker

    available sprinkler irrigation systems to supply preset quantities

    of water under the control of a programmable system (McCann

    et al., 1997; Camp et al., 1998; Chávez et al., 2009) or

    development of new systems with variable rate irrigation

    capabilities (Han et al., 2009). With hardware capable of

    supplying different amounts of water, precision irrigation

    control is transformed into a zoning/mapping operation, with

    regions requiring similar quantities of irrigation water (based on

    soil properties or plant requirements) clustered together.

    Delineation

    of

    irrigation

    management

    zones

    has

    been

    accomplished through measurement of soil properties at

    different locations within the area under irrigation to generate

    databases that are used to determine location-speciﬁc irrigation

    settings (Hedley C. B. and Yule I. J., 2009; Chávez et al., 2009;

    Moral et al., 2010; Nahry et al., 2011; Liakos et al., 2015; Boluwade

    et al., 2016). Aggregation of on-site sensor measurements with

    satellite data to develop decision support and zone management

    systems for use in precision irrigation control is described by

    multiple researchers as well (Zhang et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2011;

    De Benedetto et al., 2013a; Barker et al., 2018).

    result

    applications. Such approaches, however, fail to respond to the

    dynamics of plant water requirements. Recent approaches

    incorporate plant-based measurements to dynamically update

    zoning maps generated from soil properties. O’Shaughnessy et al.

    use real-time plant water stress readings taken during irrigation

    events to dynamically update the zoning maps used for precision

    irrigation

    control

    (O’Shaughnessy

    et

    al.,

    2012a).

    In

    Goumopoulos et al., a wireless sensor network integrating

    measurements from soil, plant, and atmosphere is applied in

    generation of irrigation management zones and used for control

    of a wireless actuator network for precision irrigation within a

    greenhouse (Goumopoulos et al., 2014).

    3.3.2 Agricultural robots

    Introduction of robotic agents in automation of irrigation

    water delivery is an emerging area of research interest. With

    appropriate path planning and ﬁeld preparation, greater

    ﬂexibility in geographical location of irrigation heads is

    achievable, and the role of such robots is easily expandable to

    include multiple functions, such as sensing of soil and plant

    characteristics, collection of samples, and delivery of agricultural

    chemicals. Jafari et al. introduce an autonomously guided vehicle

    for relocation of sprinkler heads within an irrigated ﬁeld (Jafari

    et al., 2013). The replacement of manual labour with robotic

    actuation improves on accuracy and speed of irrigation, as well as

    minimizes wastage of water. Gealy et al. develop a hand-held

    robotic device used for ﬁne-tuning emitter settings in a modiﬁed

    drip irrigation system (Gealy et al., 2016). Water delivery can be

    set to match individual plant requirements by adjustment of ﬂow

    settings at each emitter. Thayer et al. introduce a routing

    algorithm to allow a similar robotic device for precision

    adjustment of emitter settings to operate autonomously within

    a vineyard (Thayer et al., 2018). Developments in collaborative

    robotics provide further opportunities for integration of robotic

    actuation in precision irrigation. Dusadeerungsikul et al.

    (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2019) discuss the development of a

    collaborative control protocol which integrates robotic agents

    into a smart greenhouse to create a cyber-physical system that

    includes human and robotic agents. The described system

    primarily

    serves

    a

    monitoring

    and

    detection

    role

    with

    response provided by human operators. The system however

    is an indicator of the potential application of collaborative robots

    in a precision irrigation scenario, whether in sensing or actuation.

    Current research involving collaborating robotic ﬂeets,

    otherwise described as swarm robotics, is an emerging area of

    interest that could further inﬂuence future developments in

    precision irrigation control. The scalability, ﬂexibility, and

    robustness in solution of complex tasks could be employed in

    tailoring precision control decisions to allow more individually

    adapted irrigation on larger scale (Albani et al., 2017). This is

    facilitated by having specialized functions distributed among a

    larger number of robots, which can then be deployed as and when

    needed with coordinated communication (Emmi et al., 2014). Of

    particular interest are swarms composed of aerial and ground

    robots, which could integrate airborne sensing capabilities with

    ground-based application tasks, allowing real-time, closed-loop

    precision irrigation control (Grassi et al., 2017; Vu et al., 2017;

    Potena et al., 2019).

    4 Challenges and opportunities

    Irrigation

    control

    has

    primarily

    been

    targeted

    at

    minimization of water consumption at the expense of yield, or

    maximization of yield at the expense of water consumption.

    Research on the effect of targeted water stress during speciﬁc

    growth periods however indicates that it is possible to achieve

    equivalent

    or

    even

    greater

    yield

    while

    reducing

    water

    consumption

    through

    strategic

    alternation

    of

    moderate

    drought stress and recovery periods (Blum et al., 1990; Cui

    et al., 2009; Niu et al., 2018). With the ongoing depletion of

    global freshwater supplies, minimization of water consumption

    will remain an overarching target of precision irrigation, with

    advancements in technology increasingly targeting more efﬁcient

    use of every applied drop of water. An emerging Frontier that

    presents interesting research questions is the individualized

    direct control of plant growth and development by targeted

    application of environmental stresses, such as is accomplished

    through deﬁcit irrigation. This has been suggested in various

    research works (Hunt and Nicholls, 1986; Kang and Wang, 2017;

    Sánchez-Blanco et al., 2019). Kögler and Söffker compare such

    targeted growth control based on precise irrigation sequencing to

    sports training (Kögler and Söffker, 2020). Development of more

    Frontiers in Control Engineering

    Owino and Söffker

    10.3389/fcteg.2022.982463

    efﬁcient precision irrigation technology and more accurate

    models representing the complex relationship between plant

    growth and irrigation water supply is necessary to achieve

    this. More direct targeting of irrigation application to the

    speciﬁc plants that require it, with quantity and timing

    selected to just avoid the region of drought stress within

    which physiological damage or yield reduction occurs, could

    result in signiﬁcant water savings and more reliable projection of

    irrigation water use throughout the growing season.

    Integration of networking and remote access into precision

    irrigation solutions has led to a new set of challenges related to

    data security. Wireless sensor networks, Internet-of-Things

    enabled devices, and cloud-based systems can be particularly

    vulnerable to cyber security threats such as distributed denial of

    service (DDoS) attacks, integration into malicious botnets

    (Antonakakis et al., 2017) and exploitation by ransomware

    creators. This creates an additional layer of considerations to

    be included in design of precision irrigation control systems.

    Legal challenges stemming from ambiguity in regulatory

    frameworks governing implementation of new technology

    could be a setback in some precision irrigation applications,

    such as those involving robotic actors and artiﬁcial intelligence.

    Progress has been made in enacting legislation to govern

    operation of unmanned aerial vehicles within the European

    Union

    (European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General

    for

    Mobility

    and

    Transport,

    2019a;

    European

    Commission,

    Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, 2019b). Social

    and ethical issues stemming from implementation of artiﬁcial

    intelligence and autonomous robotic agents are also a cause of

    concern,

    with

    questions

    arising

    regarding

    data

    privacy,

    accountability in decisions involving human interaction and

    accessibility of criteria applied in decision-making (Müller,

    2020).

    Despite existing challenges, a wealth of opportunities

    abounds in precision irrigation research and implementation.

    Recent advances in high resolution remote sensing technology

    could also play an important role in precision irrigation. In

    particular, the use of satellite data to infer soil moisture is

    particularly practicable in introduction of precision irrigation

    principles in decision support systems for large scale irrigation

    platforms. Termite et al. apply machine learning techniques to

    infer soil moisture status from satellite imagery, providing crucial

    information for irrigation management at a municipality level

    (Termite et al., 2019).

    Further opportunities exist in application of cloud-based data

    storage and processing, allowing for reduction in setup and

    FIGURE 1

    data storage and processing, real-time communication between

    plant-based sensors, intelligent agents (including robots), supported by weather
    data and market analytics.

    operational costs through remote sharing of data and processing

    power. Enhanced accumulation of soil, plant, and environmental

    data facilitated by networked devices expands available agricultural

    data from which new models and control approaches can be

    generated and tested. On the actuation front, assistive technologies

    such as subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) (Roy et al.,

    2019), which uses an impermeable membrane to extend the

    duration of water availability to plants, could be integrated into

    precision irrigation scheduling approaches.

    What then, does the future hold for precision irrigation

    control? The incorporation of elements of Industry 4.0 in

    agricultural applications (also referred to as Agriculture 4.0)

    provides a guiding framework (see Figure 1). Plant-level

    sensors would give individual plants or plant monitoring units

    the ability to communicate their needs in real time. This

    information would be collected and processed in real time in

    an interconnected network of devices and agents. Artiﬁcial

    intelligence would then interpret the collected data and

    combine

    it

    with

    accurate,

    dynamic

    growth

    models

    encompassing speciﬁc scenarios with regard to exactly how

    much water should be consumed during the entire growth

    season, what yield is to be produced from each sector, by

    which

    date

    the

    crops

    should

    be

    arriving

    at

    speciﬁc

    developmental stages (including targeted harvest dates), and

    employing

    additional

    soil-speciﬁc

    and

    weather-speciﬁc

    information to tailor the prescription to each ﬁeld, growing

    season, and set of user preferences. A robust, adaptable

    controller would then generate a database containing the

    speciﬁc irrigation needs of each individual, and delivery of

    water would be implemented by opening of irrigation valves

    at the individual plant level, activated either remotely from a

    cloud-connected platform, or on site by swarms of mobile robots,

    each responsible for speciﬁc zones within the ﬁeld. After all, the

    best-placed entity to answer the question “how much water is too

    much water” is the individual plant, communicating its needs in

    real time and determining when it wishes to be watered, how

    much water it requires, and how much thirst it can take before

    compromising the ﬁnal expected yield.

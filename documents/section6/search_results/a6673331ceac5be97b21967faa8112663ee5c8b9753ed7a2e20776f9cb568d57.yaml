    The global food system is currently under pressure due to rising population, economic
    growth, land degradation, and increased demand for animal-based products (Keating
    et al., 2014; Lal, 2013). For example, global food production needs to be increased
    by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more
    than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate
    change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food
    productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced
    negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns,
    and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will
    likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021;
    Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists,
    policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural
    and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production
    and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial
    to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such
    technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential
    to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural
    productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer Uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source:
    Salam, 2022, used with permission). Although there is no single definition of
    IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs,
    sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become
    connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The
    first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used
    by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency
    Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various
    technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019).
    In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common
    devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including
    cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting
    systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected
    to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections
    (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion
    by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural
    sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product
    in many countries (The World Bank, 2019). TABLE 1. Chronological evolution of
    the technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Year Evolution Reference

    information among defense sectors Townsend (2001) 1973 Used in RFID tags to lock

    and transportation applications Jyothi and Vardhan (2016) 2015 IoT was used for
    locating people and objects Sharma and Lohan (2019) 2020 IoT was used for monitoring
    and controlling distant objects such as water levels in tanks in crop fields Rajalakshmi
    and Mahalakshmi (2016) The use of IoT in agriculture emerged due to advancements
    in data science, remote sensing, and computer technologies, and the need for optimizing
    decisions regarding agricultural management practices (King, 2017). Specifically,
    IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed,
    site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society
    of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy
    that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and
    combines it with other information to support management decisions according to
    estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture
    refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies.
    Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power
    of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT
    are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway
    in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making
    for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some
    examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture
    (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas
    et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation
    of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). IoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to
    the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols,
    and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and
    productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the
    use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture
    and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation
    systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals
    (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote
    sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example,
    UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz
    et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction
    (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et
    al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection
    (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al.,
    2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in
    integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are
    not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return
    on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically,
    there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different
    perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential
    to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore,
    in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications,
    potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus
    on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and
    technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications
    in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall,
    this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated
    into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food
    security in the face of climatic change and variability. Core Ideas Different
    platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.
    The application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming
    was reviewed. Potential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity
    was highlighted. Challenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were
    discussed. 2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT The key components of the IoT include IoT platforms,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be
    defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a
    service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints,
    generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an
    infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number
    of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The
    structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology
    that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed
    separately below. 2.1 IoT platforms IoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source
    suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both
    proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse
    sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering,
    aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These
    platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension
    memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from
    Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 2.1.1 FarmBot FarmBot
    is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming
    machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components
    of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and
    a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for
    monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a
    future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular
    watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected
    devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account
    to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth
    based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural
    fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and
    quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino,
    an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers,
    is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry
    Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven
    design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters.
    An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to
    carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the
    field, and capture images. 2.1.2 Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost
    computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard.
    The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor,
    USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port,
    a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan
    et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications
    in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing
    capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop
    imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying
    of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry
    Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture,
    soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user
    interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy
    crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor
    nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models
    (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy
    crops using shape features. 2.1.3 IRIS Mote An IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing
    system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected
    wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication
    ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also
    includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a
    transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog
    inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu
    et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281
    low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of
    IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication
    range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range
    is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range
    is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication.
    The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic
    parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system. 2.1.4 Zolertia
    The Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed
    for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog
    and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92
    KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It
    is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard
    batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported
    in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the
    2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto
    et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic
    variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production
    (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018). 2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit Node MicroController
    Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller
    and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs
    on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al.,
    2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural
    applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU
    was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et
    al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor
    readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture
    pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet,
    2020). 2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison The Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on
    Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed
    to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users
    to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of
    the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The
    legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels.
    It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards
    within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018).
    These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in
    producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some
    other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of
    cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019). 2.2 Wireless sensor network WSN
    is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been
    widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network
    consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical
    or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems
    are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi,
    2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes
    and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists
    of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed
    inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base
    station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor
    node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time
    physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion
    time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the
    same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user
    via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is
    established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is
    accessed through an app or end-user interface. 2.3 IoT structure IoT structure
    is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing
    equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage
    digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception,
    network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer,
    as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is
    shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components
    are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are
    crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks,
    malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Hierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure. 2.3.1 The perception
    layer The perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between
    the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings”
    collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the
    system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology,
    barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information
    collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main
    security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and
    transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not
    have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013). 2.3.2 The network
    layer The network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access
    layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base
    station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc,
    Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission
    and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication
    networks. It is analogous to a person''s nervous system and brain, which are used
    to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most
    common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes
    send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello
    et al., 2017). 2.3.3 The application layer The application layer is generally
    composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation
    layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing,
    and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing
    data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual
    reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main
    security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission,
    identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and
    software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015). 3 APPLICATIONS
    OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE Digital agriculture is directly linked with IoT.
    Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization
    of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital
    agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data
    based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines,
    or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates
    concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002)
    of digital agriculture includes: Agricultural databases that include information
    about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates
    agricultural activities to the human society. Real-time monitoring and updating
    of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information
    on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors. A network transmission
    and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer
    signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery. The actuation
    framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic
    Information System and Global Position Satellite systems. Different crop, soil,
    and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases,
    pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and
    soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal
    et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural
    parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes
    with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient,
    qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making.
    Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast
    crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture
    are discussed as follows. 3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture Traditionally, satellites
    have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al.,
    2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable
    for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud
    cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach
    to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined
    as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft,
    its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links,
    and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation”
    (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed
    to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield,
    and different soil physical and hydraulic properties. Nowadays, smart technologies
    have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs,
    smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for
    near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation
    indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors
    are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index,
    normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted
    vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status
    by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave
    regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3). TABLE 2. Different
    sensors used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their advantages and disadvantages

    applications (Table 4; Acharya et al., 2021). Two widely used UAVs include fixed-wing
    and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing UAVs use airplane-like
    wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their properties include lower
    cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared to rotary-wing UAVs.
    Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are characterized by vertical
    takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude, and lower flight speed. UAVs
    may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring of vegetative indices using
    near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be
    sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete,
    2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of UAVs in spraying herbicides on
    up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate farmers’ direct contact with poisonous
    chemicals and hazardous operational conditions. UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate
    application maps from the images to determine the strength of nutrient uptake
    in a single field. This has the potential to further minimize fertilizer costs
    and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al., 2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software
    have shown potential in stitching together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs
    to develop 3D maps for monitoring soil erosion and developing conservation strategies
    (Acharya et al., 2021). More recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite
    (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making
    informed decisions, and increasing yield (Cai et al., 2019). TABLE 4. Applications

    aerial imaging and field and crop monitoring 3.2 Cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems The main purpose of cloud-based information communication
    technology (ICT) systems is to provide tools to software developers to develop
    a variety of cloud-based services to monitor plant growth parameters and predict
    crop yield (Kaloxylos et al., 2012). This infrastructure consists of data collection,
    statistical analysis, and the creation of commands to control farming equipment.
    In a practical setup, data is generally transferred from a local farm management
    system to the cloud repository associated with the monitoring service in order
    to keep track of the farm activities. The data is subsequently analyzed by an
    expert online system such as an e-agriculturist, and outputs are made directly
    available to the farmers. An ICT system has three major components (Patil et al.,
    2012). The first is an information collection layer, which consists of a sensor-based
    climatic and agricultural dataset. Data may include but is not limited to air
    temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, atmospheric gas concentrations;
    names, models, and prices of agricultural products; operating status of agricultural
    equipment, and locations of agricultural products. The second layer is the transport
    or network layer, which is responsible for transmitting and processing data received
    from the sensor layer above. Finally, the application layer analyzes and processes
    information to cultivate digital awareness. One of the leading examples of a cloud-based
    ICT system is GeoFarmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). GeoFarmer consists of a modular
    design, which is interoperable through an application programming interface. It
    follows open access standards regarding existing tools and technologies and the
    system is designed and developed in accordance with user needs. Further, the entire
    process and lessons learned in the development process are documented. Similar
    software architecture has been defined in FIWARE, an open-source platform for
    a smart digital future, which focuses on agricultural sensors with reprogrammable
    firmware and a set of interfaces already embedded in the General Packet Radio
    Service board. Cloud-based systems have been applied to monitor pesticide use
    and safety in vegetable crops (Qian et al., 2018). Interfaces of such systems
    consist of guidelines for pesticide purchasing and application, optimal harvest
    time estimation, and a feedback system formulation to monitor the health of vegetables.
    A mobile-based cloud architecture was implemented through AgroMobile (Prasad et
    al., 2013), which enhances smart agricultural practices with the help of image
    processing techniques, image visualization, and cloud-based data processing. A
    similar precision agriculture technique using cloud computing has been proposed
    in enhancing the capacity for special education leadership for aggregate farming
    in the cloud (Castillejo et al., 2020) to increase efficiency and productivity
    and reduce labor costs. Other applications include quality control in greenhouse
    production, and monitoring soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature in
    agricultural plots. 3.3 Big data in agriculture Big data refers to datasets that
    are too large to be analyzed by traditional data processing software and applications.
    The integration of big data technologies and best farming practices has the potential
    to facilitate improved crop production, plant protection, postharvest analysis,
    and environmental conservation. The major applications of big data in different
    topologies of digital agriculture are available from Sarker et al. (2019) and
    are briefly discussed here. The first application of big data is in precision
    agriculture. Thus, data collected using sensor-enabled hardware and software tools
    is used for assessing, controlling, and improving crop management, crop performance,
    and environmental quality. The second application is prescription agriculture,
    where big data is used to prescribe agronomic practices for optimizing yield.
    The third application is in enterprise agriculture, which includes the agribusiness
    platform and links field data to inventory, logistics, machinery, and profit.
    Finally, the fourth application is in automated agriculture, where farm data and
    environmental data are used to automate agriculture through robotic technologies.
    The data lifecycle in agriculture consists of data generation, warehousing, cleaning,
    annotation, and processing to optimize or improve agricultural production while
    maintaining the quality of the environment (Chaterji et al., 2020). In the following
    section, we briefly describe each of these steps. Data generation may involve
    the use of site-specific or public data. Site-specific datasets, such as soil
    nutrient composition and fertilizer usage, are generally privately held. Examples
    of public data may include topographic or soil textural information of a location.
    Data warehousing allows the data to be integrated from multiple sources and then
    restructured for improved performance. Data annotation is a data labeling technique
    that translates an encoded value to raw data. Because classical WSNs have limitations
    in interpreting and understanding the context of raw sensor data, annotation is
    highly recommended for end-user applications (Khan et al., 2015). On the other
    hand, getting rid of the corrupt or inaccurate values from the tables is a very
    important step in processing and helps to eradicate outliers from the dataset.
    Finally, processing imagery data results in more useful formats, which is largely
    accomplished by using a variety of analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence.
    Despite the considerable importance of big data in modernizing agriculture, a
    dearth of publicly available, high-quality datasets remains a formidable challenge
    to farming using alternate techniques. A combination of machine learning and IoT
    may be crucial in filling those gaps and in designing interactive wireless sensor–actuator
    networks for the commercial application of alternative farming systems (e.g.,
    Aquaponics) (Dhal et al., 2022a, 2022b; Dhal, Jungbluth, et al., 2022). 3.4 Digital
    twins in agriculture Digital twins generally refer to a digital replica of real-world
    entities mirroring their behavior and states over the entire lifetime in a virtual
    world. It is generally a standardization of real-world variables and can be used
    irrespective of place, time, and human observation (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2022).
    A digital twin in agriculture has been described as a multi-physical, multi-scale,
    and probabilistic simulation model of complex production. It uses a combination
    of in situ sensors and physical models to mirror physical life. Information from
    sensors and satellite data is taken as input to design digital twins (Verdouw
    et al., 2021) and is utilized in reproducing historical statistics and predicting
    future values. The process involves data integration, Artificial Intelligence,
    and machine learning. Digital twins show potential for aiding in planning and
    managing soil operations, irrigation, robotics, and farm machineries (Nasirahmadi
    & Hensel, 2022). WSNs in farmlands and cloud servers that run machine learning
    algorithms can detect plant diseases, weed clusters, and nutrient deficiencies
    (Angin et al., 2020). Indeed, significant progress has been made in using digital
    twins in the field of arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture,
    and livestock rearing (Howard et al., 2020; Verdouw et al., 2017). For example,
    digital twins have been designed to monitor the health of cows (Bos taurus) and
    pigs (Sus domesticus), model firmness and loss of vitamin content in mango (Mangifera
    indica), identify diseases and pests in olives (Olea europaea) and other crops,
    assist in fleet management and tracking machinery, and identify pesticide exposure
    in bees (Apis mellifera) (Pylianidis et al., 2021). These applications of the
    digital twins within the agricultural sector have been observed in seven major
    fields: real-time monitoring of data, energy consumption analysis, system failure
    analysis and prediction, optimization of resources, behavioral analysis, technological
    integration, and virtual maintenance (Angin et al., 2020). More recently, the
    concept of digital twins has been applied in postharvest management by categorizing
    simulations into three stages: input, throughput, and output (Dyck et al., 2022).
    This enables monitoring of moisture and temperature of grain to ensure safe storage
    and movement within the elevator. Further, a sensor network could be used in storage
    to ensure the optimal quality of grains. 4 ADVANTAGES OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE
    The demand for agricultural products will increase as the global population grows
    and as climate change occurs (Bradshaw & Brook, 2014). IoT shows the potential
    to lower the impact of these challenges while meeting this demand for agricultural
    products. Indeed, IoT offers a potential solution to increase agricultural efficiency
    and productivity while saving time, labor, and money. Because of the cost and
    time effectiveness of IoT systems, the use and installation of IoT devices in
    the agricultural industry are increasing by nearly 20% annually and are expected
    to reach 225 million devices by 2024 (Elijah et al., 2018). In addition, the expansion
    of cellular service and 5G connectivity introduced by satellite and cellular network
    companies in rural areas have boosted the use of IoT in recent years (Di et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2022). The advancement of IoT connectivity to personal and
    portable electronic items, such as cell phones, iPads, and tablets, along with
    the introduction of advanced WSNs and machine learning facilitates real-time data
    retrieval, processing, and decision-making. The advantages of IoT in agriculture
    include interoperability, wide advantages of WSN, and data management using cloud
    and fog computing. In the following section, we discuss these advantages in detail.
    4.1 Interoperability The data collected through WSNs and sensor nodes is made
    available using apps, equipment, and products to communicate and process them
    in a way that does not require any involvement from end users, which is called
    interoperability (Tzounis et al., 2017). In other words, interoperability is the
    data communication approach that allows using different information systems to
    transfer and comprehend information. The interoperability process consists of
    two methods. The first method makes the data available through a local area network
    or a wide area network. The second method shares the data via software or hardware
    between different systems and machines. In the utilization of IoT, interoperability
    plays a vital role in facilitating and exchanging effectively organized data between
    information systems. Interoperability provides multiple benefits, such as system
    adaptability, better productivity, data unity, improved data protection, fewer
    errors, and lower data acquisition costs. The interoperability functionality includes
    three approaches, which include syntactical, structural, and semantical approaches
    (Aydin & Aydin, 2020). Syntactic interoperability allows the use of two or more
    systems simultaneously to communicate and share data even if the interface or
    language is not the same. Structural interoperability defines the standard data
    exchange format from one system to another to understand the information clearly.
    Moreover, semantic interoperability allows connecting two or more systems and
    sharing data between them in a meaningful way. 4.2 Smart irrigation and decision
    support The use of sensors and communication technologies, microcontrollers, and
    actuators has the potential to improve water use efficiency, reduce the cost of
    irrigation, and increase crop productivity (Abbasi et al., 2019). For example,
    UAVs are increasingly used in monitoring plant water use efficiency, which provides
    a base to select plant varieties for breeding and crop improvement, particularly
    in water-limited systems. Soil moisture sensors using capacitance or frequency
    domain technology are able to continuously monitor soil moisture in determining
    irrigation rate and time. Farmers may use mobile phones or wireless personal digital
    assistants to remotely control data loggers and monitor and analyze moisture for
    irrigation scheduling and automation. The applications of different machine learning
    algorithms in developing irrigation support systems are shown in Table 5. The
    irrigation DSS allows a weekly schedule to meet the irrigation water needs of
    a plantation based on inputs to a data-driven model. Some automated and smart
    irrigation systems using WSN, the Internet, cloud computing, and optimization
    tools are discussed in Krishnan et al. (2020) and Ramachandran et al. (2018),
    among others. TABLE 5. Application of machine learning techniques as decision
    support systems in Internet of Things (IoT)-based agricultural applications. Application
    of IoT in irrigation decision support, input, and salient features Reference Input
    variables: Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, dew point, vapor

    future irrigation schedules formulated Li et al. (2018) Input variables: Forecasted

    (decision support system [DSS]-based and soil-moisture based) have been proposed
    to improve cotton yield and water productivity Chen et al. (2020) Irrigation scheduling
    has been formulated using Fuzzy logic methods Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015)
    Output variable: Irrigation schedules Machine learning model: Linear regression,
    random forest regression and support vector regression Torres-Sanchez et al. (2020)
    4.3 Smart greenhouse One application of WSNs includes the conversion of a traditional
    greenhouse into a “smart greenhouse” (Kodali et al., 2016). The sensors automatically
    adjust the greenhouse climatic conditions, such as air pressure, relative humidity,
    air temperature, and light conditions, according to a particular set of instructions.
    The real-time greenhouse environment may be monitored via email and SMS alerts
    on mobile phones. For example, the installation of soil moisture sensors in the
    greenhouse activates an irrigation system only when the soil is dry. Recently,
    the use of solar-powered IoT sensors (Hou & Gao, 2010) has made building smart
    greenhouses an inexpensive and popular choice. 4.4 Data management With an increase
    in the application of IoT in multiple sectors and high-performance computing trends,
    the conventional database system has failed to meet the need and demand for massive
    sensor-derived data storage. In this regard, cloud base and fogging data storage
    in IoT platforms play a vital role in managing, transferring, and analyzing data
    into meaningful information using analytical tools. Cloud and fog computing have
    their characteristics to process data burdens and preferences, but they supplement
    each other. Using predictive analytics, a farmer could better predict weather
    conditions, maintain crop quality, and enhance soil fertility to formulate better
    plans and decisions related to crop harvesting and enhance crop quality and productivity.
    4.4.1 Cloud computing Cloud-based data management provides an option for computing
    resources on a pay-per-use basis. It is an extension of cluster and grid computing
    that collects resources at one central place and utilizes them for high-performance
    computing employing wireless connections (Qian et al., 2009; Armburst et al.,
    2020; Dillon et al., 2010). Such a computing system could be divided into two
    parts: front end and backend. The front end consists of client devices, such as
    computers, cell phones, tablets, and iPads, whereas the backend consists of data
    storage and processing located far away from the client. Cloud computing architecture
    provides three types of services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    PaaS, and Software as a Service (SaaS) (Dempsey & Kelliher, 2018; Jagli et al.,
    2018; Laghari et al., 2016). IaaS platform is a remote data center that provides
    the right to change or configure storage capacity, processing power, and networking
    to their needs. PaaS provides a development platform for an application developer
    to create, test, and launch an application. SaaS deals with ready-made software
    tailored to various business needs and customer services. Cloud technology is
    also used to deliver mobile applications and is called mobile cloud computing
    (MCC). This method handles the information and relocates the storage from mobile
    devices to intense and centralized computing platforms situated in the cloud (Huang,
    2011). MCC takes the pressure off mobile devices by harnessing the power of cloud
    infrastructure. Many cloud service providers are compatible with Windows or Linux
    operating systems, such as Amazon Web Service, Server Space (ITGLOBAL), Microsoft
    Azure (Microsoft Corporation), Google Cloud Platform (Google LLC), IBM Cloud Services
    (International Business Machines Corporation), Adobe Creative Cloud (Adobe Inc),
    and Dropbox (Dropbox Inc). 4.4.2 Fog computing The motivation behind fog computing
    is the need for real-time computing. It is an extension of cloud computing that
    consists of multiple edge nodes directly connected to the physical device. As
    the nodes are physically much closer to the device, it seems more advanced and
    provides better performance than cloud computing for handling user requests and
    emerging standards (Atlam et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017). Fog computing can
    include cloudlets, a small-scale and robust data center located at the edge of
    the network system to perform computation without sending it to a distant server.
    Thus, fog computing acts as an intermediary between computing hardware and a remote
    server, controls the information being sent to the server, and processes it locally.
    It supports heterogeneous devices to provide greater interoperability than cloud
    computing. However, the security and privacy concerns in Fog computing are big
    issues due to the prevalence of wireless networks from a business point of view
    compared to cloud computing and deserve further research (Khan et al., 2017).
    Because of attacks, such as jamming attacks, and sniffer attacks, numerous organizations
    are focusing on considerable research on the security issue of Fog computing,
    including Cisco, Microsoft Corporation, ARM Holding Plc, and Dell Inc. Farmers
    benefit from cloud and fog data management by registering into the system application.
    The application is often designed to store farmers’ details, agronomic marketing
    details, agronomic vendors, and agricultural service providers, such as fertilizer,
    pesticides, seed, and equipment, and information on the government''s scheme.
    Indeed, cloud and fog data management systems have both advantages and disadvantages
    (Table 6), which largely determine the choice of using one over another. TABLE
    6. Pros and cons of cloud and fog computing in Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud
    for IoT Fog for IoT Pros Cons Pros Cons Improved performance between IoT sensors
    and data processing system High latency because of the distance between client
    devices and data processing centers Low latency because users are geographically
    closer to Fog to get an instant response A more complicated system in data processing
    and storage/decentralized computing Storage capacity can be scalable to store
    and share enormous amounts of data Downtime due to interruption in network and
    multiple connected channels No issues with bandwidth and connection because multiple
    interconnected channels are involved in sending the data Additional expense requires
    routers, hubs, and gateways Virtual processing capabilities on demand via remote
    data center Security and privacy could be limited because thousands of gigabytes
    of data are being transferred simultaneously High security because numerous nodes
    are involved in the complex distribution system Potential for cyberattacks, such
    as jamming and sniffer due to the extension of network''s edge Reduced cost because
    of lower licensing fees than the cost of equipment and maintenance Rescheduling
    of failure management is slow Power efficiency and improved user experiences because
    each node runs efficiently and provides instant response to the users Limited
    scalability—because it cannot be scalable as the cloud 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    OF USING IOT IN AGRICULTURE Data-driven agricultural practices are largely focused
    on precision, predictive, smarter, and efficient farming practices with minimal
    use of resources and enhanced agricultural automation (Ayaz et al., 2019; Patil
    et al., 2012). Therefore, the usage of IoT in agriculture is inevitable with the
    increasing demand for food, land, and changes in climatic conditions. However,
    IoT in agriculture presents several challenges. These challenges and opportunities
    are observed at different levels of data handling and analysis: Collection, data
    transmission, processing and storage, and the application of the data inferred
    (i.e., inference drawn from available data without much expense of resources;
    Tzounis et al., 2017) and are discussed in detail as follows. 5.1 Data collection
    Different IoT sensors are typically designed for a particular agriculture practice
    (Dholu & Ghodinde, 2018). The use of such sensors in different locations and climates
    is often challenging and may require either modification in design or further
    calibration. An ideal sensor should be user-friendly, efficient, robust, and able
    to withstand variable weather conditions. Although experts in the field can set
    up, install, and connect equipment, the application of data by farmers on day-to-day
    basis demands skills and training. The collection of real-time data is increasingly
    important in precision farming and requires an active Internet connection, which
    further presents a major challenge in IoT applications in underdeveloped countries
    and rural areas in the United States (Federal Communications Commission, 2020).
    Although IoT has been widely used in the field of precision agriculture, only
    proprietary solutions are currently being implemented, which creates difficulties
    with device compatibility and connectivity. There is a pressing need to discover
    other approaches that employ interoperable hardware built on open standards and
    platforms. Lower priced alternatives to expensive proprietary solutions can be
    found in the form of many already available products that are built on open hardware,
    at least in part (Stočes et al., 2016). Scaling up the use of integrated IoT technologies
    beyond early adopters is important, especially by making existing solutions easier
    to use and more affordable, thereby improving their selection and use by farmers
    and food companies. Therefore, business models that work for small companies and
    systematic analysis of associated costs and benefits may be necessary. More effort
    is necessary in improving the utilization of IoT technologies in a wide range
    of climates, crops, and soils. Efforts could be centered on the development of
    IoT devices for harsh environments (open air, dirt, dust, moisture, animal manure,
    cold storage, hot cleaning treatments, etc.) and for natural objects (plants,
    animals, square meters of soil, perishable food products), which have limited
    ways to embed IoT devices in the objects themselves. This is especially true for
    devices that use new technologies because there has already been a lot of progress
    in adapting more mature technologies (Verdouw et al., 2017). Indeed, IoT includes
    a large variety of heterogeneous devices; therefore, it is challenging to achieve
    high levels of compatibility among devices if they employ dissimilar standards
    and protocols. In order to overcome such obstacles, standard IoT protocols ought
    to be designed (Abbasi et al., 2019). There are several challenges associated
    with UAV deployments in the agricultural sector, including limited flight durations
    (<1 h), small coverage area, high costs, large amounts of imagery data resulting
    from flights, and geometric and radiometric correction issues. Further, UAVs could
    interfere with civilian aircraft and generate safety issues. There are often stringent
    national laws issued by aviation authorities in each country regarding flying
    UAVs. Typically, the only permission granted is for educational or experimental
    purposes. In the United States, the maximum flight altitude is 120 m above ground
    level, and UAVs are not permitted to fly at night. Finally, processing large volumes
    of imagery data requires special skills, time, and software, often demanding the
    use of machine learning, communication technologies, and data repositories. 5.2
    Data transmission, storage, and processing IoT systems must communicate, store,
    and process the data they have acquired. Data transmission is made feasible with
    adequate connectivity. Many parts of the world, including the United States, have
    poor or no broadband and Internet connection. A significant obstacle to IoT applications
    is the access to internet. Presence of agricultural fields in distinct locations
    limits Internet use and other connectivity (Antony et al., 2020). The data collected
    from one agricultural landscape is often not applicable in other areas. Although
    proper storage and security of the collected data are important, the cost of storage
    and further analysis and processing of stored data to develop an inference for
    its application in the fields remains challenging. New technologies, such as Starlink
    (https://www.starlink.com), free TV band/channels, and other communication channels,
    could be exploited to substitute Internet at remote locations. Further, it is
    important to consider human factors when sharing and communicating information
    between farms, regions, and enterprises. 5.3 Data security Security of routing
    protocols is a major challenge in WSNs. Privacy issues in WSNs are either data-oriented
    or context-oriented. The former is largely associated with handling, preserving,
    and integrity of datasets. The latter deals with contextual information like location
    and time (Abbasi et al., 2019). Indeed, data security, anonymity, and privacy
    present both formidable challenges and opportunities to coordinate data transfer,
    availability, and usability securely for both small and large stakeholders. Agricultural
    data can be difficult to mine because of its volume, noise, gaps, and heterogeneity.
    This, however, provides opportunities for data imputation, standardization of
    IoT, integration of multiple domains, and collaborative research in sensor and
    communication technologies (Abbasi et al., 2019; Verdouw et al., 2017). There
    are opportunities for developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through
    new sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remotely sensing vehicles,
    communication technologies, and deep learning methods. 5.4 Application of the
    inferred data IoT provides a foundation for smart logistics, intelligent transportation,
    and affordable agricultural application to address climatic challenges, improve
    resource utilization and efficiency, and increased productivity (Chen & Jin, 2012).
    However, challenges remain in efficient data transmission systems and adaptation
    of outputs by farmers. Indeed, farmers must be technology savvy to understand
    and utilize information. Certain changes may be necessary at farmers’ fields,
    which may incur additional expenses for data collection or processing. Rural farmers
    are often hesitant to adopt new technology. The use of IoT in agriculture is challenging
    due to the complexity of agricultural fields and farming operations. Research
    in IoT is often constrained by short-term funding; thus, limiting data collection
    processes. Antony et al. (2020) reported that 2 to 3 years of funding in the agriculture
    sector is relatively ineffective as plants’ cropping cycle may vary with weather
    conditions. However, the need to feed the growing population has bestowed opportunities
    in utilizing recent advances in IoT (Mahanta et al., 2022) in greenhouse farming,
    vertical farming, hydroponic, and plant phenotyping. Nevertheless, we see a plethora
    of opportunities to utilize WSNs, digital twins, machine learning, and cloud computing
    in soil and crop monitoring, irrigation scheduling, water quality analysis, plant
    breeding, weed control, disease, and pest identification, pesticide spray, reuse
    and recycling of wastes, and livestock management. 6 CONCLUSION This paper reviewed
    the application of different IoT platforms, WSNs, and technologies like UAVs,
    cloud computing, and big data analytics in agricultural production systems and
    value chains, such as crop monitoring, irrigation support, weed and pest control,
    fertilizer application, and soil health assessment. The literature, in general,
    indicates the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and machine learning
    in automated and smart irrigation systems and agricultural decision support. Different
    red, green, and blue, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR sensors could be
    mounted on UAVs for improved agricultural monitoring and forecasting to enable
    highly efficient, qualitative, and profitable farm products. Big data, data mining,
    and real-time analysis show promise to support and improve precision, prescription,
    enterprise, and automated agriculture. Cloud and fog data storage in IoT platforms,
    however, appear to be crucial in managing, transferring, and analyzing big agricultural
    data. This review also reveals opportunities in improving data security, anonymity,
    and usability, and developing high-throughput phenotypic platforms through new
    sensors or improvements in existing sensors, robotics, remote vehicles, communication
    technologies, and deep learning methods. Overall, IoT can improve production levels,
    cost-effectiveness, product quality, safety, and traceability through innovation,
    automation, and control while advancing the much-needed digital transformation
    of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

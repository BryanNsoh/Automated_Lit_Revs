    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\

    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    rights and content Abstract Our planet is facing a serious fresh water crisis
    and improved management of water resources presents significant research challenges.
    About 70% of the world''s fresh water is consumed by agriculture and water application
    efficiencies are typically low. Improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture
    would deliver substantial economic and environmental benefits. To help address
    the issue of low water application efficiency, wireless sensor network technologies
    can be combined with automation to support the efficient production of food in
    a increasingly water limited future. This paper reports on results of combining
    these approaches to irrigate an apple orchard, where existing irrigation scheduling
    was predominately based on time consuming manual acquisition of soil moisture
    data. The system developed allowed fully automated on-farm irrigation based on
    real-time feedback control which increased economic water use efficiency by 73%
    compared with manual irrigation. It is suggested that the application of real-time
    feedback automation would dramatically improve economic efficiency for irrigators
    with low water efficiency. Whereas, for those irrigators already achieving high
    water efficiency, adoption of the technology provides substantial labour and time
    savings. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords AgricultureEnvironmentsFeedback

    \ to show the possibility of using practical and applicable irrigation scheduling\
    \ program which was \ndesigned by Water Resources Department at the University\
    \ of Baghdad by using Spreadsheet Formulas for \nMicrosoft Excel program, version\
    \ 2007, with some modification to generalize it and made it applicable to \nvarious\
    \ climatic zone and different soil types, as a salvation for the shortage of irrigation\
    \ water inside the \nirrigation projects. Irrigation projects which incidence\
    \ of Tigris River basin will be taken as an applicable \nexample. This program\
    \ was based on water budgeting and programmed depending on scientific concepts\
    \ \nwhich facilitate irrigation structures operation and ease the use by farmers.\
    \ By using the abilities of this \nprogram, the monthly and annually water requirements\
    \ and drainage water were estimated. Finally a \ncomparison is made between the\
    \ calculated discharges with the designers suggested ones. This comparisons \n\
    showed that the use of this type of irrigation scheduling (i.e. predicted irrigation\
    \ scheduling) with its \napplicable constrains require high attention when choosing\
    \ the cropping pattern for each climate zone. Also \nit found that this irrigation\
    \ program is a useful tool for saving water if cropping pattern has been chosen\

    \ Effect On Water Requirements \n Tamara Sideeq Bakr \n \n97\n  \nINTRODUCTION\
    \ \n             Irrigation scheduling means how much \nwater should be applied\
    \ and when to irrigate. To \nmake this decision, there is some steps should be\
    \ \nfollowed to make right decision. First of all crop \npattern and information\
    \ of each crop should be \nknown, such as growing season, growing and \nharvesting\
    \ date, root depth, and allowable \ndepletion, soil physical properties, climate,\
    \ \navailability of water resources, and field water \nlosses also should be known.\
    \ Three main \nschedules are known, these are: constant depth; \nconstant interval;\
    \ and practical irrigation schedule.  \n            A range of irrigation scheduling\
    \ methods \nhave been developed to assist farmers and \nirrigators to apply water\
    \ more efficiently taking \ninto account crop evaporation and rainfall. \nIrrigation\
    \ scheduling includes the following \nmethods: \nFirst - traditional method which\
    \ unfortunately is \nthe method adopted many farmers. This method is \nbased on\
    \ individuals decision and depends on \nprevious observations without taking into\
    \ account \nthe need of plant to water. This method consumes \na large amount\
    \ of water without scientific \njustification, and it may cause Lack of soil \n\
    aeration, Washing nutrients from the soil, and \nLack of productivity. \nTherefore,\
    \ this method must be disposed of. \nSecond - modern methods which are methods\
    \ \nbased on scientific base to take into account \nseveral factors affecting\
    \ water consumption, and \nthese methods depend on climatic factors, soil \nfactors,\
    \ plant type, or depending on all these \nfactors. \n             The use of computer\
    \ programs to help \nscheduling irrigation was introduced in the \n1970’s. \n\
    However, \nonly \nrecently \nwith \nthe \nintroduction of fast, personal computers\
    \ have they \nbegun to gain wider acceptance (Martin, 2009). \nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ is based on three methods \nand tools; they are plant stress measurement, \n\
    predictive models, and soil moisture measurement \n(Antosch, 2007). \n       \
    \       Nevertheless, since 1990's there has been \na wide range of proposed novel\
    \ approaches to \nirrigation scheduling which have not yet been \nwidely adopted;\
    \ many of these are based on \nsensing the plant response to water deficits rather\
    \ \nthan sensing the soil moisture status directly \n(Jones, 1990a). Infrared\
    \ sensors have been used to \ndetermine canopy temperature and scheduling \nirrigations\
    \ (Stockle and Dugas, 1992; Alves and \nPereira, 2000)   \n             Alternative\
    \ \napproach \nto \nirrigation \nscheduling has been opened up, this approach\
    \ \nbased on measurements of sap-flow rates, because \nsap-flow rates are expected\
    \ to be sensitive to \nwater deficits and especially to stomatal closure. \nSap-flow\
    \ measurement used by many workers for \nirrigation scheduling and control in\
    \ a diverse \nrange of crops, including grapevine (Eastham and \nGray, 1998; Ginestar\
    \ et al., 1998 a, b), fruit and \nolive trees (Giorio and Giorio, 2003; Remorini\
    \ \nand Massai, 2003; and Moriana, 2007) and even \ngreenhouse crops (Ehret et\
    \ al., 2001).  \n             Hamad (1996) developed a practical and \neasy procedure\
    \ for preparing seasonal or annual \nirrigation programs for an irrigation project.\
    \ The \ndeveloped procedure is based upon some practical \ncriteria among them\
    \ are the: \n• \nSupplied discharge would be constant in all \nirrigations; \n\
    • \nTime of application would be also be constant \nthroughout the season; \n\
    • \nStarting day of all irrigation in the season or \nthe year would be the same\
    \ day in the weak in \norder to make the farmers and irrigators \naccustomed to\
    \ the days of irrigation; and \n• \nIrrigation intervals are selected in such\
    \ a way \nto avoid crop stress due to insufficient soil \nmoisture. \n       \
    \       Al-Hadaad (1997) developed a model to \npre-schedule irrigations in large\
    \ irrigation projects \nbased upon average physical soil properties and \ncrop\
    \ water requirements. This model also includes \nestimating expected annual crop\
    \ production of the \nproject for a given cropping pattern.  \n             Riffat\
    \ (1999) developed an optimization \nprocess to maximize total crop production\
    \ from a \ngiven cropping pattern in an irrigation project by \nusing pre-scheduled\
    \ irrigations and pre-specified \nconstraints on the volumes of applied water\
    \ and \ncropping intensity. \n            Irrigation \nscheduling \nusing \npan\
    \ \nevaporation (CPE), relies on measuring the \namount of water evaporated from\
    \ the container \n Journal of Engineering\n Volume   19  January   2013      \

    \ an \neasy way and does not require high-tech. The idea \nof this method depends\
    \ on the farms crops lose \nwater \nduring \nthe \nirrigation \nprocess \nby \n\
    evapotranspiration; this quantity is a large missing \ndepends on climatic factors,\
    \ so the method give \nthe irrigator indication when to irrigate. Several \nexperiments\
    \ have been carried out using this \nmethod in Saudi Arabia, where it became clear\
    \ \nthat this method has provided a quantity of \nirrigation water and up to 25%\
    \ compared to \ntraditional methods, which rely only on the period \nbetween irrigations\
    \ without taking into account \nthe climatic factors (Alderfasi, 2000). \n   \
    \          Al-Hadaad (2001) evaluated the effect of \nusing weighted average root\
    \ depths and a certain \nlevel of depletion in building an irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ program for large projects containing \ndifferent crops on water stress of wheat\
    \ crop \nduring the growing season. \n             Irrigation scheduling by using\
    \ the guide \nof the crop water stress (CWSI), takes into \naccount the climatic\
    \ factors like air temperature \nand relative humidity and temperature of the\
    \ plant \nas well as the water situation of the soil and crop. \nThis guide is\
    \ divided into ten equal parts where \neach part refers to the situation of water\
    \ for each \nsoil, plants, and sets time limit for irrigation \nmanner. This method\
    \ is a modern and requires \nsophisticated technology based on the theory of \n\
    remote sensing to measure the temperature of \nvegetation and its relation to\
    \ the situation of water \nfor soil and plants. Irrigation scheduling using this\
    \ \nmethod has given good results in the case study of \nwater plants and irrigation\
    \ scheduling and is \nrecommended for use in most agricultural crops, \nsince\
    \ they rely mainly on climatic factors, which \naccount for most of the water\
    \ consumption of \nplants (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001). \n             Al-Mesh'hedany\
    \ (2002) investigated the \neffect of using a practical irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nprocedure (based upon average information about \nplants consumptive use rate\
    \ and effective root \nzones) on the production and growth of each \nplant, for\
    \ a given cropping pattern grown in a \nlarge irrigation project. The research\
    \ included \nexecuting a water budgeting procedure on a daily \nbasis considering\
    \ the amounts of water moving \ninto and out of the root zone for each plant grown\
    \ \nin the project during its growing season. This \nresearch showed that there\
    \ is a certain irrigation \nscheduling program, which minimize water \nlosses,\
    \ prevents water stress for all plants grown \nin the project, maximizes project\
    \ outcomes, \nminimizes project requirements such as applied \nirrigation volume\
    \ throughout the whole year, and \nmaximizes effective irrigation water stored\
    \ in the \nroot zone. \n             Al-Azba et al. (2004) developed a \ncomputerized\
    \ \nprogram \nby \nusing \nGIS \nfor \nestimating irrigation water requirements\
    \ in KSA. \nHe took into consideration easiness in use. The \nmethodology which\
    \ was provided by (Allen et al., \n1998) for calculating crop water requirements\
    \ was \nfollowed. Noting that they considered that crop \ncoefficient (kc) value\
    \ during development and \nmaturity stages are constant like initial and mid-\n\
    season stages. The value of (kc) for development \nstage was taken as an average\
    \ of (kc) during initial \nand mid-season stage, and maturity stages are \ncalculated\
    \ as an average of (kc) during mid-season \nand (kc) at the end of growing season.\

    \ adopted in this \nresearch is that developed by Hamad (1996) and \nAl-Haddad\
    \ (1997). It is a practical and applicable \nprocedure that can be adopted in\
    \ large irrigation \nprojects since it is simple to use and easy to \nunderstand\
    \ by project manager and farmers. It was \nbased on the following constrains:\
    \ \n1. Applied discharge at the project head gate is \nconstant throughout the\
    \ whole year, such \napplication would facilitate the operation of \ncontrolling\
    \ and distribution structures of \nirrigation network. \n2. Irrigation time is\
    \ held constant during the year \nor at least during the growing season, in order\
    \ \nto habituate the worker and farmer on \nirrigation time in the project. \n\
    3. Irrigation time must be chosen in a way that \nfacilitates water distribution\
    \ and project \noperation and should be full-days and \navoiding parts of the\
    \ day. \n4. Irrigation interval must be selected in a way \nthat crops will not\
    \ be stressed due to \ndecreasing soil moisture content and will not \ncause over-irrigation.\
    \ \n5. Starting date of each irrigation during the year \nis the same day of the\
    \ week and the day of \nstarting of irrigation scheduling. Such a \npractice would\
    \ habituate the farmer to \nirrigation date, and the date of water \ndistribution\
    \ between farmers. \n              These constrains can be useful for a \nsingle\
    \ large project. Since this program is \nintended to be applied along the Tigris\
    \ River basin \nwhich is different in soil properties, climate, and \ntypes of\
    \ planted crops; such variation should be \ntaken in account when building a scheduling\
    \ \nprogram. Some modifications on these constrains \nare required to make it\
    \ more comprehensive, so \nthe third and fifth constrains are modified as \nfollows:\
    \ \n1. For heavy soils, the starting day of each \nirrigation during the year\
    \ is the same day of \nthe week as the day of starting the irrigation \nschedule\
    \ or irrigation year. For light soils, \nthere are two possible irrigation days\
    \ in the \nweek, first day has the same interiority of \nheavy soils irrigation\
    \ day and the second is in \nthe middle of week of the day of starting \nirrigation\
    \ year. \n2. In winter season, time of irrigation will be \nchosen in a way that\
    \ does not affect crop \ngrowth, while in summer season there is a \ncontinuous\
    \ irrigation except in rainy zones.  \nAdditional constrains shall be used and\
    \ these are:      \n1. Soil is homogenous and isotropic; \n2. Initial soil water\
    \ content at the beginning of \nirrigation scheduling is known; and \n3. Soil\
    \ water content at field capacity and \nwilting point are constant throughout\
    \ the root \nzone of the whole project. \n       \nDESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA\
    \ \n             Soil-physical properties of Iraqi soils vary \nfrom one site\

    \           The first step in irrigation scheduling is to \ndetermine crop water\

    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n            To simplify discussion, Nahr Sa'd \nirrigation\
    \ project in Maysan Governorate was \ntaken as an example. Nahr Sa'd irrigation\
    \ project \nis located within the southern zone. This zone \nhas a different textured\
    \ soil refers to the ancient \nirrigation zone. At present, this zone has a saline\
    \ \nsoil to a variable degree, average additional \nleaching water requirements\
    \ for southern Iraq \nwere taken as 19-19.5% (General Scheme of \nWater Resource\
    \ and Land Development of Iraq, \n1982). In winter season and during the first\
    \ \nmonth \nof \nirrigation \nscheduling \ncalendar \n(October), irrigation depth\
    \ was applied twice a \nweek if it is required, with a chosen time of \nirrigation,\
    \ taking in account the irrigation \ninterval. In summer season, continuous irrigation\
    \ \nis used since there is no rainfall during the \nsummer \nseason \nperiod \n\
    and \ncrop \nwater \nrequirements become large during this season. \nTo minimize\
    \ water losses and avoid plant water \nstress in summer season, irrigation depth\
    \ was \napplied twice a week with an irrigation interval \nequals irrigation time\
    \ and equal 3.5 (days). In \nthis zone, the effective rainfall is not sufficient\
    \ \nto supply crops water requirements. In other \nwords, irrigation water is\
    \ required even in winter \nseason to supply crop water requirements. \nFigure\
    \ (2) shows monthly applied irrigation \nvolumes \ndistribution \nby \nusing \n\

    \ in applied water distribution between \napplying \nirrigation \nscheduling \n\
    procedure \n(calculated) case and designer suggestion \n(allocated) case. Applied\
    \ irrigation volumes in \nscheduled case are less than those allocated to \nthe\
    \ project, and there is 7% of water lost as \ndrainage water. It is known that\
    \ the southern \nzone requires 19-19.5% of water to leach salts, \nso the 7% of\
    \ applied water which is lost as a \ndrainage water, is used to leach salts, therefore\
    \ it \ncan be said that there are no water losses. Table \n(1) also shows that\
    \ 36.59 million m3 of water \nwere saved. This is a good result if the plants\
    \ are \nnot suffering stress. After checking plant statue \nby using a water budgeting\
    \ program it was \nfound that: \n              All winter crops are suffering\
    \ from \nstress and soil moisture content is below wilting \npoint at the beginning\
    \ of growing season. The \nmaximum plant root depth under soil moisture \ncontent\
    \ below the wilting point is approximately \n5 (cm) long. It was supposed that\
    \ this case is an \nacceptable, since in spite of the plant initially \nrequires\
    \ high frequent and little quantities of \nwater, \"shallow root depth can absorbs\
    \ required \nwater when it logged to full the soil water \nreservoir\". Since\
    \ planted crops root depths are \nbetween 600–2000 (mm),  So 50-60 (mm) root \n\
    depth \"which represents 10% of minimum plant \nroot depth\" was considered as\
    \ little root depth, \nand under this depth, the plants will not be lost \neven\
    \ the soil moisture content is under the \nwilting point level. Winter plants\
    \ statue is \nillustrated in the figure (3). \n \nFigure (3). Variation of soil\
    \ water content for \nbarley during the growing season for Nahr \nSa'd irrigation\
    \ project.  \n             Figure (3) shows a good plant statue \nsince soil water\
    \ content curve approximately \nconforms to field capacity curve. At the \nbeginning\
    \ of growing season, the soil water \ncontent curve overreaches wilting point\
    \ curve, \nthis is done with root depth not exceeds 60 mm, \nso it is acceptable\
    \ as mentioned previously.  \n           Summer crops have two behaviors: the\
    \ \nfirst one is soil water content exceeds wilting \npoint at the beginning of\
    \ the growing season \nwith root depth not exceeding 60 (mm). The \nsecond one\
    \ is soil water content exceeds wilting \npoint at the beginning of the growing\
    \ season \nwith root depth exceed 60 (mm), which means \nlosing the crops. Figure\
    \ (4), and (5) show these \ntwo behaviors, respectively. \nAmer Hassan Al-Haddad\

    \  \n             During \nsummer \nmonths, \ntime \nof \nirrigation is at its\
    \ maximum possible value and \napplied irrigation depth is maximum possible. In\
    \ \nspite of that, the plants such as maize grain \n(autumn) do not receive enough\
    \ depths to \nprevent stress. To know the reasons that lead to \nlose maize grain\
    \ (autumn), several possibilities \nwere considered, these possibilities are reviewed\
    \ \nbelow and examine their impacts on the output \nof irrigation scheduling procedure.\
    \ It should be \nnoted that these possibilities vary in success \nbetween one\
    \ irrigation project and another. \n            First possibility is applied discharge\
    \ is \nnot \nsufficient \nto \nsupply \ncrops \nwater \nrequirements. To study\
    \ the discharge effects, \nassumed annual discharges are fed to irrigation \n\
    scheduling program and the results are shown in \ntable (2). \n           Table\
    \ (2) shows that the increment in \napplied discharge shows no responding of Maize\
    \ \ngrain (autumn) plant statue, beside the increment \nin water losses and reduction\
    \ in water saving. \nThe increment in applied discharge causes \nincrement in\

    \ \ncaused changing in applied irrigation frequency, \nbut this change in frequency\
    \ does not affect \nMaize grain (autumn) statue. This indicates that \nthe applied\
    \ discharge is enough for satisfying \ncrops water requirements, other parameters\
    \ are \nrequire some management. \nTable (2). A comparison among four used \n\

    108\n \n            Second possibility is soil water reservoir \nnot \nsufficient\
    \ \nto \nsupply \ncrops \nwater \nrequirements. Many researches used weighted\
    \ \naverage of plants root depths as a guide to \nchoose the right depth of soil\
    \ water reservoir, \nwhich minimize applied irrigation water depth \nwithout stressed\
    \ plants, when more than one \ncrop are planted. In this research, the weighted\
    \ \naverage of plants root depths was replaced by \nusing a percentage of the\
    \ longest monthly \nplanted crops root depth as a proposed solution \nfor stressed\
    \ plant in crop pattern. By using a \npercentage of maximum root depth, the balance\
    \ \nbetween water losses, plant statue, and applied \nirrigation depths be possible\
    \ and be more \nflexible by controlling the frequency of applied \nirrigation\
    \ depth.  \n           To study whether used soil water \nreservoir depth is sufficient\
    \ for storing enough \nwater for crops, a comparison among ten used \npercentages\
    \ of maximum root depth is shown in \ntable (3): \n             It is clear from\
    \ table (3) that when \nreservoir depth increases, water losses decreases \ndue\
    \ to the increase in reservoir capacity. Saved \nvolume of water also increased.\
    \ This is because \nwhen reservoir depth is small, it can store little \nquantity\
    \ of water with more frequent irrigations \nand the rest is lost as drainage water.\
    \ With the \nincrease in soil water reservoir depth, irrigation \nfrequency will\
    \ be less, stored water volume \nincreases and lost water decreases. Table (3)\
    \ \nshows reduction in saved volume of water and \nincrease in applied irrigation\
    \ volume at last two \npercentages, this is due to the change in \nirrigation\
    \ frequency . As shown in table (3), \nmaize grain (autumn) does not respond due\
    \ to \nchanging the soil water reservoir depth. This \nindicates that the used\
    \ soil water reservoir depth \nis enough to satisfy crops water requirements,\
    \ \nother parameters require some management. \n             Third possibility\
    \ is using inefficient \npercentage of planted area to study the effect of \n\
    the percentage of planted area, assumed \npercentages of planted area are fed\
    \ to irrigation \nscheduling program. In Nahr Sa'd irrigation \nproject, same\
    \ planted crops were used but with \nan assumed area for these crops. With many\
    \ \ntrials, the right percentages of plant area which \nimprove water saving without\
    \ losing crops could \nnot be found.  \n            Last possibility that used\
    \ cropping \npattern inefficient for applying used irrigation \nscheduling procedure,\
    \ to improve that the used \nprocedure is useful for saving water without \nharmful\
    \ stress if cropping pattern are chosen \ncarefully, Nahr Sa'd irrigation project\
    \ with \nassumed cropping pattern will be discussed. In \nassumed crop pattern,\
    \ 5 winter season crops, 11 \nsummer season crops, and 6 perennial crops are \n\
    planted with cropping intensity equals 137%. \n             The results are shown\
    \ in the table (4). \nThe table shows an acceptable percentage of \nwater losses\
    \ with more than 59 million m3 of \nwater saving. After checking crops statue\
    \ it was \nfound that all planted crops have no harmful \nstress. This result\
    \ proves that if cropping pattern \nis chosen carefully, used program is useful\
    \ for \nwater saving. \n \n \nQ (m3/sec) \n \n12.42 * \n13 \n14 \n15 \nApplied\

    Get rights and content Abstract In this work, a modeling and scheduling approach
    for an integrated storm water management and irrigation problem is presented.
    The primary objective is to simultaneously ensure that the green space is irrigated
    appropriately and the level of the storm water pond is maintained adequately.
    It is proposed to use closed-loop irrigation scheduling to achieve the objective.
    A steady-state model is developed to calculate the soil water storage for different
    irrigation amounts. To handle the uncertainty, real-time feedback from the pond
    is used to re-evaluate the scheduling optimization problem every week. Simulation
    results show that the proposed closed-loop scheduling gives much improved control
    performance. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Irrigation

    system 1. Introduction Increased urbanization and reduced natural vegetation have
    led to significantly increased storm water volumes. Storm water is surface runoff
    that flows over roofs, driveways and roads rather than infiltrating into the ground
    during any rain or snow melt events (City of Guelph, 2017). Stormwater is typically
    collected using city drainage system and is either stored in storm water ponds
    or discharged to downstream water bodies. In the literature, there are studies
    on improving storm water quality (Chen et al., 2002, Nnadi et al., 2015, Urbonas,
    1999, Urbonas and Stahre, 1993) and reducing storm water volumes by using permeable
    pavements or construction materials (Pratt, 1990, Rahman et al., 2015). The reuse
    of storm water in irrigating city green space such as parks, sports fields and
    green roofs is advocated for sustainability and has been considered in Herrera
    et al., 2017, Petrucci et al., 2012, Sample and Heaney, 2006, Schwecke et al.,
    2007 and VanWoert et al. (2005). When storm water is used for irrigating neighboring
    parks or sports fields, the storm water is managed near to its source which reduces
    the chance of flooding in downstream areas. To increase the efficiency of the
    storm water pond, overflow and dry-out events need to be reduced. Thus, there
    is a need to study the interplay between storm water pond level and irrigation
    scheduling. In practice, scheduling for irrigation in agriculture involves estimating
    soil moisture consumption based on available weather data and evapo-transpiration
    model and accordingly determining irrigation amount for fulfilling the water deficit
    (Bras and Cordova, 1981, Cahoon et al., 1990, Hassan-Esfahani et al., 2015, Jensen
    et al., 1970, Thorp et al., 2017, Wardlaw and Barnes, 1999). The study by Nguyen,
    Ascough, Maier, Dandy, and Andales (2017) considers irrigation and fertilizer
    scheduling together in a single optimization problem. The uncertainty in evapotranspiration
    (ET) was considered in some early irrigation scheduling studies (Jensen and Wright,
    1978, Rhenals and Bras, 1981). In those studies, it was concluded that explicitly
    considering the uncertainty in ET does not significantly improve the overall irrigation
    performance. On the other hand, it was shown in Gowing and Ejieji (2001) that
    it is worthwhile to explicitly consider the uncertainty in weather conditions
    in irrigation scheduling. The impact of time horizon in irrigation scheduling
    was also studied in Bergez and Garcia (2010) and Cai, Hejazi, and Wang (2010).
    One common feature of the above studies is that they only solve the scheduling
    optimization problem once at the beginning of the crop growing season and use
    the solution for the entire season. Real-time feedback from the field is not used.
    While the above methods were successful, the direct application of them to the
    problem considered in this work, in which there is strong coupling between the
    water pond level and the irrigation of the green space and uncertainty plays a
    significant role, does not work as will be illustrated later. In this work, it
    is proposed to use a receding horizon scheduling approach to handle the uncertainty
    in weather, modeling and to handle the strong interaction between the pond level
    and green space irrigation. In the proposed approach, the scheduling problem considers
    a finite prediction horizon into the future and the solution of the scheduling
    problem is updated every week based on updated weather forecast and real-time
    pond level. The main contributions of this paper include: 1. A receding horizon
    irrigation scheduling approach with re-evaluation (rescheduling) based on real-time
    measurements for improved performance under uncertainty. 2. An approach to develop
    a steady-state model that provides improved estimation of soil moisture in the
    root zone. 3. Extensive simulations comparing the proposed approach with existing
    irrigation scheduling approaches demonstrating the applicability of the proposed
    approach. Download : Download high-res image (336KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. An illustration of the system considered. 2. System description
    and modeling Fig. 1 shows the integrated storm water pond and city green space
    system considered in this work. In this system, storm water from the neighboring
    community is collected by the storm water pond, which acts as a settling tank
    for the contaminants. It is considered using the less contaminated water at the
    top of the pond for irrigating the nearby green space. This helps reduce tap water
    consumption in irrigation and adds flexibility to storm water management. The
    primary objective is to simultaneously ensure that the green space is irrigated
    appropriately and the level of the storm water pond is maintained adequately.
    2.1. Dynamic soil moisture model In this work, the dynamics of soil moisture of
    the green space is modeled as an agro-hydrological system described by the Richards
    equation (Richards, 1931) as below: (1) where is the soil moisture content (cm/cm),
    is the hydraulic conductivity (cm/h), is the vertical distance inside soil matrix
    (cm), includes the source and sink terms , such as soil water extraction rate
    by plant roots and is the matric potential (cm) also known as soil suction. The
    relation of hydraulic conductivity with soil moisture content (Mualem, 1976) is
    shown in Eq. (2): (2) where is saturated hydraulic conductivity, is the shape
    parameter (Schaap & Van Genuchten, 2006) and is the relative saturation given
    by: where is the residual moisture content (cm/cm), is the saturated moisture
    content (cm/cm). Richards equation is often written in the following form: (3)
    where is the hydraulic capacity, which accounts for the change of soil moisture
    due to the change of soil matric potential; that is, . The relation between matric
    potential and soil moisture content is described by the Van Genuchten model (Genuchten,
    1980) as shown in Eq. (4) below: (4) where and are empirical shape factors, and
    is the inverse of air entry suction ( ). In general, is considered as a dependent
    variable of such as . The evapo-transpiration (ET) is calculated using Penman-Monteith
    equation using hourly weather data. The details of the dynamic model are described
    in Nahar, Liu, and Shah (2017). 2.2. Pond level model The dynamics of the pond
    level is modeled based on mass balance where the inputs to the pond include the
    storm water from city drainage system and pond precipitation volume , and the
    outputs include irrigation and evaporation from the pond. It is assumed that the
    pond cross-sectional area is the same at all depths. The equation that describes
    the dynamics of the pond level is as follows: (5) where, (cm) denotes the pond
    level, is the cross-sectional area of the pond and is the area of the green space
    that needs to be irrigated. The evaporation from the pond is calculated following
    the methods described in Kohli and Frenken (2015). The storm water flow rate from
    city drainage system is modeled as a function of the precipitation rate and it
    is assumed that at any time precipitation on the neighborhood of the drainage,
    which has an area of , enters the storm water collecting drainage system. Therefore
    . Also, the precipitation on the pond . Remark 1 In this work, the pond is modeled
    as a tank with the same cross-sectional area from the top to the bottom for brevity.
    In the proposed closed-loop scheduling framework, different types of pond models
    can be used in a straightforward manner as long as the model can represent the
    dynamics of the pond level adequately. When a different pond model is used, we
    should update (13c) in the scheduling optimization problem (13) and the scheduling
    implementation algorithm remains the same. Remark 2 Note that in this work, we
    do not consider water run-off or run-on events due to slopes explicitly. However,
    we assume that water run-on or run-off affects the level of the storm water pond
    through city drainage system (i.e.,  in Eq. (6)). It is assumed that at any time
    50% precipitation on the neighborhood enters the pond through the storm water
    collecting drainage system. 2.3. Modeling of weather conditions To model the weather
    conditions, two different weather datasets were generated. One weather dataset
    represents the historical weather data and the other weather dataset contains
    the actual weather data. To simulate realistic weather forecast an algorithm is
    developed which generates weather forecast either between or near to historical
    and actual weather data. The historical weather data contains weather data for
    32 weeks for six weather parameters including maximum and minimum temperatures,
    humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and the amount of precipitation on hourly
    basis. Since only precipitation has a direct impact on irrigation decision making
    therefore among the weather parameters only precipitation values are reported
    in the study. In the actual weather dataset, the precipitation amount may vary
    considerably from the historical weather data. In the proposed scheduling approach,
    the historical weather data and two weeks’ weather forecast are used. The following
    algorithm is used to generate the weather forecast, where the actual and the historical
    precipitation values are denoted by and , respectively, and their percentage deviation
    is denoted by . a. Check whether the difference between the actual and the historical
    weather data is smaller than . If so, the actual weather data is used as the forecast
    data. b. If is greater than , check if . If true, then the forecasted precipitation
    , otherwise , where . Here for both conditions, we have considered . d. If is
    between and , check if . If true, then forecasted precipitation , otherwise .
    Here, we have considered when is true, otherwise is taken as 0.3. For example,
    if the historical and actual precipitation values of a week is given by mm and
    mm, respectively, then the deviation is . Further, is smaller than , so the forecast
    is given by . Note that in the above algorithm, is a tuning parameter. When is
    small (close to 0), the generated weather forecast will be close to the actual
    weather; when is big (close to 1), the generated forecast will be close to the
    historical data. In this work, we use to make the forecast closer to the actual
    weather condition and at the same time to introduce some uncertainty in the forecast.
    3. Semi-empirical steady-state model for scheduling The models described in Section
    2 will be used to simulate the green space and the pond. The dynamic soil moisture
    model described in Section 2.2 is not suitable for scheduling with large time
    horizon due to its high computational complexity. In this section, a semi-empirical
    steady-state model will be developed for scheduling. Note that since we perform
    scheduling for the crop growing season (e.g. a few months) and use weekly sampling
    time to determine the weekly pond level and irrigation amount set-points, a steady-state
    model is adequate enough to describe the overall trend of the soil moisture over
    such a relatively long period as demonstrated later in the simulation results.
    In many studies, soil water deficit model is used for scheduling. However, it
    only gives soil moisture estimates between field capacity and permanent wilting
    point, which only covers water deficit case and does not consider the stress caused
    to crops when over irrigation happens. Fig. 2 shows the relation between root
    water extraction and soil moisture condition (Feddes, 1982), where the water stress
    co-efficient is shown with respect to soil moisture . The desired stress factor
    is one, which refers to maximum or maximum root water extraction. It can be seen
    that when soil moisture is between and the desired value is achieved. When the
    soil moisture drops to wilting values , the value becomes zero and the plant wilts.
    The upper value of desired soil moisture generally refers to field capacity and
    the lower value depends on both soil and crop types. refers to the aeration point
    above which the plant undergoes severe stress due to lack of enough aeration and
    ceases. In soil moisture deficit model (Allen, Pereira, Raes, & Smith, 1998),
    it is assumed that is equal to the field capacity and water above field capacity
    drains sufficiently fast and over-irrigation never happens. However, in the problem
    considered in this work, water conservation is not the primary objective and the
    green space may need to be controlled close to the saturation but below aeration
    point, to avoid pond overflows. Therefore, a model that is suitable for scheduling
    for the problem considered in this work needs to be developed. The modeling objective
    is to determine a steady-state input–output relation between the influx and soil
    moisture . Download : Download high-res image (93KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Graph of the water stress factor . The steady-state model is developed
    based on the analytical solution to Richards equation in Tracy (2011). To derive
    the steady-state model, instead of Van Genuchten’s model (Eq. (4)), the simplified
    Gardner’s model as shown in Eqs. (6)–(7) is used to estimate the relative hydraulic
    conductivity and soil moisture content. (6) (7) where and is some empirical parameter
    depending on soil properties. With the above simplified model, a steady-state
    relation between the input flux and output pressure head at a specific depth can
    be obtained as follows: (8) where (cm) is the steady-state output pressure head,
    is soil parameter, represents the unknown top steady-state pressure head in the
    analytical solution, is the length of soil profile under consideration, is the
    depth at which the steady-state output pressure head is calculated. The detailed
    steps of this derivation are described in Appendix of this paper. Since the output
    of the steady-state model is , so from Eq. (8) is used to estimate using Van Genuchten’s
    model (Eq. (9)) with the additional term which reflects the role of the term in
    Eq. (8). (9) Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download : Download full-size

    . Left figure is for depth 1 cm and right figure is for depth 22.5 cm. The intermediate
    depths are not shown but they also have similar results. Since is unknown in the
    analytical solution, it is proposed to identify based on the data obtained from
    the system. The dynamic agro-hydrological model described in Section 2.1 is used
    to generate soil moisture data for 20 different values of the input flux . In
    each case, the input flux is kept constant for hrs. It is assumed that within
    hours the soil moisture will reach steady-state and the soil moisture value at
    200th hour is recorded. Based on this simulated data, a steady-state relation
    between the input flux and the steady-state soil moisture is generated. It can
    be observed from Fig. 3, that the relation between the flux and soil moisture
    is similar to exponential growth curve. To capture this relation, is chosen as
    an exponential function of . It is considered in Eq. (9) where the numerical values
    were determined using curve fitting. The figure shows that Eq. (9) performs considerably
    well, so this approach is used to determine the output steady-state soil moisture
    values. Since Gardner’s model simplifies relative saturation to be equal to (Eq.
    (7)) instead of the complex term used in Van Genuchten’s model, the use of Gardner’s
    model to determine from results poor performance and therefore is not used. Based
    on Eqs. (8) and (9) as well as the expression of , the steady-state input–output
    model at depth can be expressed as a compact function as follows: (10) In the
    proposed scheduling algorithm, the water storage of the entire root zone will
    be considered. To address this, the entire soil profile under consideration is
    divided into compartments as shown in Fig. 4. In each compartment, the soil moisture
    is assumed to be a constant over the week and will be estimated using the above
    steady-state model. The compartment where the root ends is denoted by , where
    . The water storage within the entire root zone may be approximated as follows:
    (11) where (cm) is the soil water storage, and are the height and soil moisture
    of compartment , respectively. Based on Eqs. (11) and (10), the relation between
    the irrigation inputs and the soil water storage can be expressed as follows:

    by the proposed scheduler and the lower-level set-point tracking controllers.
    The scheduler determines the (reference) amount of water used from the pond for
    irrigation and the (reference) amount of tap water used for irrigation. These
    reference amounts are sent to lower-level controllers for implementation. 4. Proposed
    scheduling algorithm In the proposed approach, the scheduling problem is formulated
    as an optimization problem, which is re-evaluated every sampling time (a week)
    based on pond level feedback to accommodate uncertainty in modeling and weather
    conditions. The scheduler determines the (reference) amount of water used from
    the pond for irrigation and the (reference) amount of tap water used for irrigation
    based on the steady-state soil moisture model and the pond model as well as available
    weather information. These reference amounts are sent to lower-level controllers
    for implementation. The overall hierarchy of the decision making process is shown
    in Fig. 5. 4.1. Formulation of the scheduling optimization Scheduling for irrigation
    using storm water involves solving multiple prioritized objectives using one single
    objective function. For irrigation scheduling the most prioritized objective is
    to maintain soil water storage of the root zone within a desired range. Some secondary
    objectives are to minimize the overflow from the pond for wet seasons and to avoid
    pond drying out and to minimize the use of tap water for irrigation when there
    is no water available in the pond for irrigation. The formulation of the scheduling
    optimization problem at the sampling time is shown below: (13a) (13b) (13c) (13d)
    (13e) (13f) (13g) Eq. (13a) describes the objective function that needs to be
    minimized over the horizon to determine the optimal solution. The decision variables
    of this optimization are tap water usage , pond water usage , slack variables
    and for maintaining soil moisture within range, and slack variable for avoiding
    overflow. In the objective function the tap water usage is directly minimized
    with the cost . The irrigation amount with pond water is also penalized with a
    small cost to make the solution unique inside the feasible range. Eq. (13b) is
    the steady-state model that predicts soil water storage as described in Section
    3. Eq. (13c) is the discrete-time version of the pond level model as described
    in Section 2.2. Eqs. (13d)–(13g) are the constraints of this optimization problem.
    Eq. (13d) is used to keep soil water storage above some lower limit . The variable
    is added to ensure a feasible solution is achieved. Since the violation of this
    constraint is not acceptable so the variable is associated with the highest cost
    in the objective function. Similarly, Eq. (13e) ensures that stays below some
    upper limit and is also associated with large cost . Eq. (13f) describes that
    the pond must not overflow and the slack variable is associated with the cost
    . Eq. (13g) implies all physical constraints. The irrigation amount, pond level,
    and the slack variables are all non-negative real numbers. In addition, the maximum
    value for the pond level is equal to the pond height . In the design of (13),
    soft constraints are used to incorporate constraints on soil moisture and overflow
    to ensure that (13) is always feasible. This approach ensures that a solution
    exists for the optimization problem. 4.2. Scheduling implementation algorithm
    To deal with these types of uncertainty, the scheduling optimization problem is
    re-evaluated every week based on new pond level measurement and new weather forecast
    to form a closed-loop scheduling scheme. At each sampling time, • Step 1: A new
    measurement of the pond level and the weather forecast for the following two weeks
    are obtained. • Step 2: Based on the new measurement and new weather forecast,
    the optimization problem (14) is evaluated to generate the future trajectories
    of and for . • Step 3: Only the first step values and are sent to the irrigation
    control system for implementation for the current week. • Step 4: At the next
    sampling time , go to Step 1 ( ). 4.3. Lower-level controllers As shown in Fig.
    5, the scheduler calculates the reference and and sends them to the lower-level
    controllers for tracking. In this work, it is assumed that ideal lower-level controllers
    are in place and can track the reference values immediately and perfectly for
    the simplicity of presentation. In practice, controllers may be used to track
    these references. Remark 3 Note that before implementing the proposed approach,
    a preliminary study of the field and the pond should be conducted to collect data
    for model parameter identification and uncertainty characterization purposes.
    Once adequate models of the pond and the field are identified, extensive simulations
    based on the models may be carried out for tuning of the weights, sampling time,
    prediction horizon in the proposed design. 5. Simulations In this section, simulations
    are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed closed-loop scheduling
    approach. In the simulations, the models described in Sections 2.1 Dynamic soil
    moisture model, 2.2 Pond level model are used to simulate the dynamics of the
    pond level and the soil moisture of the green space. Specifically, the parameters
    used in the simulations are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Parameters of the experimental

    scheduling First, the performance of the proposed closed-loop scheduling and an
    open-loop scheduling method under two weather conditions over a time period of
    16 weeks is compared. In the open-loop scheduling method, the scheduling optimization
    is solved in the first week only (no re-evaluation) and the solution obtained
    in week 1 is used for the entire 16 weeks. In the first case, a wet weather condition
    is considered. As mentioned in Section 2.3, the historical weather data has precipitation
    during week 1–6 with an average of mm, week 13–14 with an average of mm and finally
    week 23–28 with an average of mm in Fig. 6(a). The actual weather data is shown
    for the first weeks only. It is considered that the actual rain takes place between
    weeks 5–10 with an average of mm. The weather forecast is available real time
    for two coming weeks. Download : Download high-res image (663KB) Download : Download

    under wet weather conditions. (a) weather conditions, (b) weekly irrigation amount
    from the pond, (c) the pond level and (d) overflow incidents. The weighting factors
    in the cost function of the scheduling optimization problem are selected as follows:
    . The optimization horizon for both closed-loop and open-loop scheduling is taken
    as weeks. In the optimization problem, the upper limit for soil water storage
    is considered to be cm corresponding to cm/cm of soil moisture and the lower limit
    for soil water storage is cm corresponding to cm/cm of soil moisture. Initial
    pond level is considered to be  cm. Soil water storage corresponding to saturation
    is  cm. Fig. 6 shows the simulation results. Fig. 6(b) shows the pond irrigation
    amount. In the open-loop scheduling, the historical weather data is used. Due
    to the mismatch of the historical weather data and the actual weather data, the
    prescribed pond irrigation is overall much lower in open-loop scheduling compared
    with closed-loop scheduling. This renders more (both time and amount) overflows
    under open-loop scheduling. In closed-loop rescheduling scheme, pond irrigation
    increases after week 6 following the heavy rain incident thereby reducing the
    chance of overflow as indicated by the pond level in Fig. 6(c) and overflow incidents
    shown in Fig. 6(d). In Fig. 6(c), during open-loop scheduling the predicted overflow
    occurred at only week 6, but due to heavy rain the overflow took place for the
    entire period between week 7 and week 10. Though the period of overflow in the
    closed-loop rescheduling is similar to open-loop scheduling but the amount of
    overflow is much smaller in closed-loop rescheduling as shown in Fig. 6(d). The
    soil moisture condition is shown in Fig. 7 and the soil water storage values are
    shown in Table 2. It is clear from Table 2 that the soil water storage value at
    all time is less than the saturated soil water storage value of cm for both schemes.
    Except the rainy periods (week 5 to 9) the actual soil water storage value for
    the closed-loop scheduling scheme is within the upper and lower limits , but for
    open-loop scheduling the soil water storage value was much higher. Similar results
    were noticed in Fig. 7. It shows that at the beginning (week 1), the soil moisture
    at the bottom of root zone was low for both closed-loop scheduling and open-loop
    scheduling scheme. During the actual rainy weeks (week 5 to 9) both schemes give
    higher soil moisture. But as soon as rain stops, the closed-loop scheduling shows
    better performance in terms of ground condition (week 13 and 16) since the soil
    moisture remains between field capacity and permanent wilting. Download : Download

    scheme (closed-loop) and dashed lines stand for scheduling without feedback (open-loop).
    Table 3 shows the summary of the results. It is clear that when closed-loop scheduling
    scheme is used the overflow of the pond can be reduced. It needs to be mentioned
    that though the soil moisture is above field capacity ( cm/cm) at some periods
    but it is still below saturation ( ) so there are no ponding events. Table 2.

    1.942 15 3.895 3.263 16 3.891 3.345 In the second case, a dry weather condition
    is considered. The dry weather data was generated using low precipitation amounts
    as shown in Fig. 8(a). The historical weather data contain precipitations during
    weeks 1–6 with an average of mm of rain, weeks 13–14 with an average of mm and
    weeks 23–28 with an average of mm. The actual weather has rain between week 4
    and week 12 with an average of mm. It is considered that the maximum tap water
    that can be used is cm/week. Note that under significantly different weather conditions,
    some of the parameters in the scheduling optimization problem should be re-tuned
    to obtained good performance. In particular, the upper and lower limits for soil
    water storage need to be adjusted. In the previous wet weather condition, overflow
    was the main event that needed to be avoided and the crop was under stress between
    (some aeration point near saturation) and (field capacity). In the dry weather
    condition, the pond is more likely to dry out than overflow. Further, as shown
    in Fig. 2, the soil moisture may violate the lower limit of which may create long
    term damage on the crops. The cost of the violation of this lower limit is much
    higher. To accommodate the modeling mismatch, the lower limit of soil water storage
    in the optimization is considered to be cm and the upper limit is considered as
    cm, which are significantly higher than the previous case. At the same time, the
    cost associated with the lower limit is increased. Thus the weighting factors
    in the cost function of the scheduling optimization problem are selected as follows:
    . The initial pond level is considered as cm and the prediction horizon is again
    weeks. The actual soil water storage values as simulated by the dynamic model
    are shown in Table 4. Table 3. Summary of results for the case of wet weather

    8(b), (c) and (d) show pond irrigation amount, pond level and potable water irrigation
    amount, respectively. From Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that in the closed-loop scheduling
    scheme, the pond irrigation is lower and the pond level is well maintained above
    zero for the entire period. While in the open-loop scheduling case, more pond
    water is used in irrigation and the pond level is very close to zero at the end
    of the period. In both schemes, tap water is used at its maximum allowable capacity.

    The soil moisture condition is shown in Fig. 9. It shows that both for closed-loop
    and open-loop scheduling the soil moisture at the bottom of the root zone reaches
    wilting point but the top root zone where most of the root water extraction takes
    place stays above the lower limit. In fact, it can be observed from Table 4 that
    the total soil water storage value stays above the lower limit cm at all times.
    Table 5 shows the summary of the results for the case of dry events. It is clear
    that when closed-loop scheduling is used, the pond level can be maintained by
    reducing the use of pond water for irrigation. It should be noted that in closed-loop
    scheduling, the soil water storage is also maintained well. The improved pond
    level management is essentially due to the use of feedback from the pond and weather
    forecast. Table 4. Soil water storage in root zone for dry weather condition.

    the effect of prediction horizon in closed-loop scheduling a third case study
    is performed with the weather data and initial conditions similar to the first
    case, but with different prediction horizons weeks and weeks. The results are
    shown in Fig. 10. Figs. 10(a), (b), (c) and (d) show weather condition, pond irrigation
    amount, pond level and potable water irrigation amount, respectively. It can be
    clearly observed that when prediction horizon weeks is used, pond level (Fig.
    10(c)) is well maintained and less pond overflow occurred (Fig. 10(d)). For weeks
    , though the predicted maximum pond level is reached at week 5 and 10 only, but
    due to weather uncertainty the overflow actually starts at week 6 and continues
    till week 10. The actual overflow which occurred after maximum pond level is reached
    is also shown in Fig. 10(d). The soil water storage condition is similar to the
    first case and is not shown. Download : Download high-res image (619KB) Download

    closed-loop irrigation scheduling for a park using city storm water. The summary
    of results for analyzing the effects of prediction horizon is presented in Table
    6. It is clear that horizon weeks performs considerably well relative to weeks
    . This suggests that smaller horizon significantly reduces the performance of
    closed-loop scheduling. Again, when this result is compared with the closed-loop
    results from the first case with weeks (Table 3 closed-loop scheduling), the results
    for horizon weeks performs slightly better. This confirms that there is some optimal
    horizon length beyond which the performance of closed-loop scheduling will not
    improve significantly anymore. Table 6. Summary of results. Empty Cell N 12 weeks

    scheduling using city storm water poses new challenges in irrigation scheduling.
    There is a need of optimization to ensure better ground conditions and good pond
    levels. The results of closed-loop irrigation scheduling suggests that overflows
    could be reduced relative to regular open-loop irrigation scheduling. The selection
    of horizon for closed-loop irrigation scheduling is important since it affects
    the overall results. Depending on regional weather and associated uncertainty
    an optimum horizon needs to be identified for improved closed-loop irrigation
    scheduling. The choice of costs in the scheduling problem corresponding to the
    two-fold objectives are very important and needs to be decided wisely. Depending
    on the choice, whether to emphasize field condition or pond level, the costs would
    be different and that would give different optimal solutions. In this study, the
    costs chosen for both wet and dry cases were such that the grass would not wilt,
    though it will face some water stress in some regions. This is done to minimize
    undesirable events associated with pond levels. The development and the use of
    steady-state model for scheduling allow us to explore the soil moisture region
    beyond field capacity and overcome the limitations of soil moisture deficit model.

    for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivity, Richards equation (Eq. (1))
    can be rewritten as: (14) Now, let us define, (15) where is a constant. To drive
    the system into steady-state the input needs to be kept fixed, so the top flux
    is fixed. Therefore, is considered. Using Eq. (15) the gradient of can be derived
    as follows: (16) Using the Gardner’s model relation and Eq. (16), the gradient
    terms in R.H.S of Eq. (14) can be expressed in terms of the transformed as follows:
    (17a) (17b) Again, using Eq. (7) and , the change of soil moisture is given by:
    (18) Bashed on Eqs. (17a), (17b) and (18), Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows:
    (19) where . For steady-state . Therefore, Eq. (19) can be written as: (20) and
    the general solution of which is given by: (21) To solve this equation, the two
    boundary conditions need to be defined to get the two parameters and . In the
    Green–Ampt problem (Tracy, 2011), pressure head boundary conditions were considered
    for which and can be easily determined. For the problem considered, the relation
    between steady-state input flux and soil moisture is needed, therefore flux boundary
    conditions are required. In order to consider flux boundary, Eq. (21) needs to
    be differentiated. So, if flux boundary is chosen both at the top and the bottom,
    the value of cannot be determined. Now to overcome this problem, a relation from
    the assumption of steady-state is used and an empirical term is added. At steady-state,
    input is equal to output, which implies . Now for free drainage condition at the
    bottom the gradient is equal to zero. According to Van Dam, Groenendijk, Hendriks,
    and Jacobs (2008) the flux is expressed in terms of pressure gradient as follows:
    (22) Now using the relation , the following relation between and is obtained:
    (23a) (23b) (23c) From the above equation and Eq. (15), it is obtained: (24a)
    (24b) Again, using Eq. (22) and for the top boundary (z=0), it can be obtained:
    (25a) (25b) (25c) Using Eq. (16), the above equation can be expressed in terms
    of as follows: (26a) (26b) where . Differentiating Eq. (21) at and using Eq. (26b),
    it is obtained: (27a) (27b) (27c) where . Again, using Eq. (21) for and Eq. (24b),
    it is obtained: (28a) (28b) (28c) Putting the values of and from Eqs. (28c) and
    (27c) into Eq. (21), the following equation can be obtained: (29) Finally, using
    the relation from Eq. (15), the following expressions is obtained: (30a) (30b)
    Eq. (30b) shows the steady-state pressure for fixed input as a function of depth
    . The value of is unknown in this equation since only the flux at is known, not
    the value of . But to our knowledge, there is no analytical means to identify
    the value of . It is assumed that at steady-state condition, will remain fixed
    and the terms in will generate some constant value. Therefore an empirical method
    is used to identify the value of the term. References Allen et al., 1998 Allen

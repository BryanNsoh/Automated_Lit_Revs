    1 Introduction Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the
    increasing demand for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation
    have proven to be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The
    concept of aquaponics, a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an
    alternative solution to sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system
    where fish and plants are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic
    relationship where the waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and
    the plants clean the water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates
    by bacteria present in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants.
    This system also provides the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply
    as compared to traditional irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic
    way of irrigation conserves as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional
    irrigation systems. It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system
    because nutrients are readily available to them and they do not have to expend
    energy searching for them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment
    of an aquaponics system provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making
    it a superior option for growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples
    of tap water as well as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity,
    and water temperature. The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on
    various factors such as the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life,
    and the weather conditions. In general, lake water can have a lower or higher
    pH level than tap water, depending on the lake''s distinctive characteristics
    and the way the local area''s tap water is treated. For instance, tap water is
    usually treated to have a pH level between 6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe
    for human consumption and does not cause corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring
    presence of suspended particles like silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause
    it to have a greater turbidity level than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware
    design of one system [1] includes various components such as sensors, actuators,
    relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino, and routers. The monitoring of temperature
    and humidity is accomplished using an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield,
    an FC-28 humidity sensor, and a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized
    to connect the Arduino Ethernet to a server. The relay module functions as a control
    switch for various actuators, which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic
    box contains several actuators, such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker,
    a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept
    track of numerous environmental factors, and over time it would be able to control
    how the farm operated and create a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes),
    brokers (local servers), and subscribers (local servers) all communicated via
    the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use of any data type. Monitoring can also
    be done with the help of a GUI program, a communication network, and [3] wireless
    sensors. A graphical user interface is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned
    issues. Farmers can get real-time notifications and advice about water quality
    even when they are not there by using AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT
    technology. When compared to the conventional approach, the introduction of the
    AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics system has shown substantial gains.
    Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate many characteristics observed
    by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics. A ZigBee module [5] can be
    used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the data gathered by the Arduino
    while also displaying the values on the LCD without performing any control actions.
    A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that simulates the sun''s rays for
    plant growth make up the aquaponics system described in [6]. The fish waste provides
    nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive water from the fish tank as a filter.
    The system makes use of actuators to operate the water pump, light panel, heater,
    and oxygen provider as well as sensors to monitor and control pH levels, temperature,
    and humidity. To direct the actual citrus production process, nutrient monitoring
    [7] in citrus plants can also be done in real time according to the soil situation.
    Another method that primarily focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies
    in image processing [8] in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional
    deficiencies. A Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid
    valves make up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method
    can help in the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing
    many sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level
    [9]. Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

  description: Pepper production is very important to Sarawak, especially to the rural
    community which supporting of about 67,000 rural pepper farmers. Currently, these
    farmers cultivate their farms using a conventional method that relies heavily
    on human labor and intuition. This method has proven to be time-consuming, a wastage
    of agriculture inputs, rely heavily on labor, and is non-proactive when it comes
    to pepper vines management. This paper is to study the use of smart farming by
    adopting digital agriculture using the internet of things (IoT) and unmanned aerial
    vehicles or drones (UAV) to monitor pepper vines farms, particularly on fertilisation
    management. The IoT and drone are used to collect environmental data such as soil
    humidity, air temperature, air humidity, and pH sensor, and drone are used to
    collect pepper vines' health status in terms of Normalize Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI). The data was then analysed using machine learning to reveal the
    interrelation between the variables that underlie the pepper vines production.
    In our analysis, we implemented Pearson correlation to show the relationship among
    selected variables in the project. Linear Regression machine learning is used
    to predict the usage of fertiliser for 20 pepper vines. To support decision-making,
    data visualization in term of graphical reports were presented in the cloud database.
    Short messaging and emails were sent to farmers when the pepper vines required
    attention in regard to soil moisture, pH, and irrigation requirements. The result
    of this analysis can support farmers in taking appropriate decisions and actions
    about their pepper vines management in terms of fertilization and irrigation.

    PDF Share Tools Pepper production is very important to Sarawak, especially to
    the rural community which supporting of about 67,000 rural pepper farmers. Currently,
    these farmers cultivate their farms using a conventional method that relies heavily
    on human labor and intuition. This method has proven to be time-consuming, a wastage
    of agriculture inputs, rely heavily on labor, and is non-proactive when it comes
    to pepper vines management. This paper is to study the use of smart farming by
    adopting digital agriculture using the internet of things (IoT) and unmanned aerial
    vehicles or drones (UAV) to monitor pepper vines farms, particularly on fertilisation
    management. The IoT and drone are used to collect environmental data such as soil
    humidity, air temperature, air humidity, and pH sensor, and drone are used to
    collect pepper vines’ health status in terms of Normalize Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI). The data was then analysed using machine learning to reveal the
    interrelation between the variables that underlie the pepper vines production.
    In our analysis, we implemented Pearson correlation to show the relationship among
    selected variables in the project. Linear Regression machine learning is used
    to predict the usage of fertiliser for 20 pepper vines. To support decision-making,
    data visualization in term of graphical reports were presented in the cloud database.
    Short messaging and emails were sent to farmers when the pepper vines required
    attention in regard to soil moisture, pH, and irrigation requirements. The result
    of this analysis can support farmers in taking appropriate decisions and actions
    about their pepper vines management in terms of fertilization and irrigation.

    Farming System Chapter © 2019 1 Introduction Agriculture is essential to both
    our continued existence and the growth of the economy. It can be attributed to
    increased demands caused by population growth and more developed social structures.
    People want different crops at different times of the year with varying quality,
    but traditional agricultural methods can’t keep up. Furthermore, due to China’s
    size and diverse topography and climate, it is difficult to grow crops in many
    regions, making it impossible to guarantee both quality and yield [1]. Greenhouses
    used in agricultural production ensure both the quality of harvested food and
    the consistency of crop yields. As a result, the negative effects of these elements
    on agricultural output will be mitigated. Farmers’ inability to plant crops, ineffective
    temperature and water control, and pollution caused by improperly implanted devices
    are just a few of the issues that must be addressed. Then there are agricultural
    products that fail to live up to the hype, which can seriously harm a company’s
    bottom line [2]. The Internet of Things arose from the widespread adoption of
    several relatively new information technologies, including sensor networks, automatic
    control, and communication. Recent technological advancements have resulted in
    significant progress in the fields of automatic control and communication, and
    the IoT is directly attributed to the advancement of these technologies [3]. As
    “smart agriculture” has become more popular, crop yields, labor productivity,
    resource conservation, and crop quality have all gone up. This is because IoT
    technology and modern farming methods have come together. The most important components
    of IoT-based intelligent agriculture systems are data collection from farming,
    data management and analysis, and decision-making based on that data [4, 5]. The
    application of modern science and technology in agricultural settings is known
    as “intelligent agriculture,“ and the term derives from the Internet of Things.
    Figure 1 demonstrated the Internet of Things-Driven Intelligent Agriculture System
    Precision farming employs scientific techniques to monitor factors such as soil
    temperature, air humidity, and air quality as crops grow [6]. This allows farmers
    to increase yields while decreasing waste. Greenhouses can produce crops at a
    variety of developmental stages because they artificially recreate environments
    that are ideal for crop growth within the greenhouse. As a result, crops can be
    grown in greenhouses at various stages of development, resulting in a wider range
    of crops. As a result, a wide range of plant species can be grown in greenhouses.
    One of the primary benefits of greenhouses is the ability to care for plants throughout
    their entire life cycles. Furthermore, if greenhouses are properly maintained,
    plants can be grown there all year round. Continuous crop monitoring is made possible
    by combining the use of greenhouses with the Internet of Things technology. When
    it manifests, it causes a domino effect that improves agricultural output management,
    increases the efficiency with which labor resources are used, and lowers production
    costs [7]. Although smart agriculture in planting is still in its early stages,
    it primarily entails the automated network monitoring system’s real-time collection
    of environmental factors related to crop planting [8]. Despite its infancy, smart
    agriculture in planting is at the cutting edge of agricultural innovation. Even
    though smart agriculture in planting is still in its infancy, it has already established
    itself as one of the most cutting-edge agricultural innovations. Despite progress,
    “smart agriculture” is still in its infancy, particularly in terms of research
    and planting applications. Fig. 1 Importance of A-Frame Diagram in Greenhouse
    Cultivation Full size image Despite these advances, “smart agriculture” is still
    in its infancy. Both academic research and practical application in planting are
    still in their infancy in the field of intelligent agriculture, which is still
    a relatively new concept. Both the academic study of intelligent agriculture and
    its actual application are in their early stages of development. The results showed
    that implementing this strategy not only reduced the rate of data transmission
    but also allowed for more precise monitoring of activities in real-time [9]. The
    main contributions related to the proposed Internet of Things-driven intelligent
    agriculture system are as follows: Firstly, Internet of Things protocols are used
    as the building blocks at the application, network, and perception levels for
    the intelligent agriculture system. These components are used to connect the greenhouse’s
    numerous multisensory, cameras, and controls. Secondly, PID controllers are used
    in engineering contexts, including the intelligent agriculture system. The fuzzy
    adaptive PID parameters must be adjusted online to control the temperature of
    the greenhouse. Thirdly, pre-processing is required to ensure accurate data extraction
    during the mining process, which improves mining efficiency. Data cleansing, integration,
    transformation, and specification have been identified as the most critical steps
    in data pre-processing. Then, Artificial regulation is required when it comes
    to crop planting. A suitable management system must be running in the background
    before data can be collected inside the greenhouse. Finally, data on air temperature,
    soil temperature, and humidity are collected every minute to evaluate the current
    environment and make any necessary adjustments using built-in temperature and
    humidity sensors. The greenhouse can evaluate the current environment and make
    any necessary adjustments using built-in temperature and humidity sensors. 2 Background
    China entered the agricultural industry late, delaying the development of advanced
    internet of things-based farming practices. Restrictions have recently been put
    on agriculture, which slows down the industry’s move toward more automation and
    intelligence. Additional optimization is required because there is still a significant
    technological and intelligence gap between China and Western countries [16]. It
    is critical that we cross this chasm as soon as possible. The current intelligent
    agriculture system, on the other hand, has amassed a substantial amount of data
    that, while initially appearing disorganised, contains a wealth of information
    that can be put to good use. When data preprocessing is done incorrectly, the
    likelihood of analysis errors increases significantly [10]. Before beginning any
    type of analysis, ensure that you have completed all the necessary data preprocessing
    steps. As a result, the dependability and value of the gathered information, as
    well as the overall caliber of the analysis, will improve. If properly processed,
    this data could provide the empirical basis for fully automated and intelligent
    environmental management and control. As a result, much more research is urgently
    needed to determine how intelligent agriculture systems can best benefit from
    the various crop qualities and climatic conditions prevalent in various regions.
    This research is critical to the success of intelligent agriculture systems, so
    it is urgently required. There is an urgent need for more research in this area.
    The first phase of this investigation will look at how humidity and temperature
    can be maintained in a greenhouse at optimal levels for plant growth. The data
    is then subjected to the FPKM algorithm to remove any redundant or unnecessary
    records. The process is completed by developing an IoT-based infrastructure to
    store, manage, and analyze the data from the test set. Intelligent agriculture
    cannot be implemented without significant advances in artificial intelligence
    and the internet of things. As part of the upgrade, an alarm system and a remote-control
    system will be integrated into the information management system. Once the upgrade
    is completed, the data management system will be used to track the development
    of the plants grown in greenhouses. This article will discuss how the Internet
    of Things is affecting the greenhouse planting industry as well as the need for
    intelligent agriculture systems to be implemented. The goal of this article is
    to lay a theoretical and empirical foundation for future research and development
    in intelligent agriculture. In the furthest priority strategy k-means algorithm,
    seeds are used as the initial starting points for the clusters [11]. The algorithm
    begins by randomly selecting a certain number of seeds from the dataset, where
    each seed represents the initial center of a cluster. These seeds are then used
    to create the initial clusters, and the data points are assigned to the nearest
    seed based on their distance. From there, the algorithm iteratively adjusts the
    cluster centers and reassigns the data points until the clusters converge. The
    selection of the initial seeds is an important step in the algorithm, as it can
    have a significant impact on the final clustering results. The furthest priority
    strategy involves selecting the seeds that are farthest from each other in the
    dataset, in order to increase the diversity of the initial clusters and prevent
    them from being too similar. This can help to avoid the problem of the algorithm
    getting stuck in local optima, where the clustering results are suboptimal. Overall,
    the use of seeds is a key aspect of the k-means algorithm, as they provide the
    initial starting points for the clusters and help to guide the iterative process
    towards a final clustering solution. The selection of the seeds can have a significant
    impact on the results, and the furthest priority strategy is one approach that
    can be used to improve the performance of the algorithm. Research on planting
    detection platforms and other related platforms is required before developing
    the Internet of Things greenhouse system. This study expands on the work of Al
    [12] by taking a more in-depth look at the demand for greenhouse planting. The
    greenhouse’s environmental parameters must be established before any type of monitoring
    can begin. Temperature, humidity, the amount of light, and carbon dioxide concentration
    are among the variables. You must ensure that this is completed before beginning
    construction on the greenhouse. Temperature, humidity, light levels, and carbon
    dioxide concentration are a few examples of environmental factors. Following that,
    it’s critical to keep a close eye on the outside variables that can have an immediate
    impact on a crop’s success or failure. Following that, the gathered information
    is saved and promptly transmitted so that farmers can use it. This will ensure
    that a clear picture of what is going on inside the greenhouse is always maintained,
    allowing appropriate corrective actions to be taken as needed. The monitor will
    then be hung inside the greenhouse and remain operational [13]. Gathering information
    about greenhouse and memorized it is an important task. The ability of a greenhouse
    to regulate the temperature of its surroundings is critical because maintaining
    a consistent temperature is one of the most important factors in healthy plant
    growth. A temperature monitoring system must be installed to ensure that the crops
    grow in ideal conditions. This will allow the temperature to be adjusted automatically
    or manually later, depending on the individual’s preference, to ensure that crops
    are grown at the optimal temperature. Farmers can use a remote-control system
    to monitor the conditions inside greenhouses even when they are not present. This
    allows farmers to adapt the greenhouse’s environment to the crops’ ever-changing
    needs [14]. Finally, a greenhouse could be outfitted with a remote early warning
    system that sounds an alarm when anomalies are detected. Power conservation is
    an option available when configuring this device. At the same time, when the greenhouse
    is not in use, the farmers can remotely turn off the necessary greenhouse equipment.
    Figure 1 depicts the specific planting specifications required for a greenhouse.
    Some of the issues that crop up during planting are due to unfavorable greenhouse
    conditions like too much or too little heat and humidity as illustrated in Fig.
    1. If the weather does not improve, crops might be lost. Traditional methods of
    delivering carbon dioxide pose health risks to humans and are inconvenient at
    best [15]. Greenhouse factor regulation through the Internet of Things is now
    required to produce higher-quality crops with less labor for farmers. The collected
    information is used to construct the greenhouse’s environmental factor control
    mechanism. Steps and strategies needed to lessen the impact of climate change
    are shown in a flowchart. Routinely, greenhouses rely on hot water pipelines,
    heaters, and hot air heating systems to keep temperatures stable. On the other
    hand, ventilation is often used to reduce temperatures. If the natural flow of
    air is insufficient, mechanically powered ventilation and cooling treatment systems
    must be installed. A specific area’s humidity level can be increased or decreased.
    One effective dehumidification method is to use cross-ventilation in the affected
    area. To add moisture to the air, the humidification process employs the use of
    a spray or a wet curtain. Installing sunshade nets, either internally or externally,
    is one method for limiting the amount of natural light that enters a space. Chemical
    techniques, such as coal combustion, ice drying, and the use of biogas fertilizer,
    can be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Once everything is connected via
    IoT, each component will be able to function independently. The greenhouse is
    considered a partially closed system because it constantly absorbs and emits energy
    and matter to the outside world [16]. The temperature is said to have reached
    thermal equilibrium when the amount of heat generated inside the greenhouse equals
    the amount of heat brought in from outside. Since the difference in energy between
    photosynthesis and respiration is so small compared to the energy made by the
    other processes, it can be left out of the actual energy calculation for the greenhouse.
    How heat moves from the surface water vapour to the air inside, how heat moves
    through the covering and external exchange, how heat moves through transpiration,
    and how heat moves from the plant. From measurements of pressure and density in
    the greenhouse environment, it is possible to deduce the following equations:
    where x stands for time, the greenhouse’s height, and the greenhouse’s internal
    air temperature. The density of air is given by and its specific heat capacity
    by. The quantity of heat generated by solar radiation within a greenhouse may
    be estimated. Both the amount of light coming into the greenhouse from the outside
    and the amount of light coming in through the mulch are considered. You can figure
    it out by plugging in the rate at which the greenhouse heating system uses heat
    and the amount of heat power that is made. The pace at which air is exchanged
    between the greenhouse’s interior and outside is directly related to the quantity
    of heat lost through ventilation. How to determine the overall heat loss from
    ventilation, which includes both internal and external heat loss. The following
    is an example of computational thinking [17]. Humidifier effects on the air, plant
    transpiration, and evaporation from the greenhouse’s surface can all contribute
    to fluctuating relative humidity. An equation was used to determine the relative
    humidity of the air. This formula may be used to make sure the greenhouse’s water
    evaporates evenly. This formula shows the rate at which greenhouse plants lose
    water through their leaves; the rate at which greenhouse surfaces lose water through
    evaporation; the difference in the amount of water vapor made by a greenhouse’s
    ventilation system; and the amount of water vapor made by a humidifier. Numerous
    research was conducted to adopt technologies for sustainable farming system [18].
    Internet of Things (IoT) is a greatly promising technology that is proposing many
    advanced solutions to modernize the agriculture sector and make it smart. The
    idea of “smart farming” is still in its infancy, but using IoT sensors can now
    easily provide and analyse data about farmers’ agricultural lands. Nowadays, Smart
    agriculture system can monitor and manage greenhouse parameters since of the advancements
    in wireless sensor networks technology. After considerable research in this area,
    scientists concluded that agriculture’s production is steadily declining. However,
    the use of technology in agriculture plays a significant role in both raising
    production and lowering the need for more manpower. IoT is an essential part to
    smart agriculture, since the IoT sensors provides all the required information
    about agricultural fields to take appropriate decisions in many situations. Therefore,
    farmers can easily monitor the field conditions from anywhere without any hassle.
    Smart farming is a new concept [19]. It attempts to use automation and IoT technology
    to make agriculture smart. Smart GPS-based remote-controlled robots with the ability
    to identify humans and execute duties like spraying, weeding, and moisture monitoring
    are the standout characteristics [20]. On the Internet of Underground Things,
    a unique approach to IoT deployments for smart agriculture is being considered.
    In-situ sensing, wireless communication in underground settings, and connection
    between architectural components like sensors, equipment, or the cloud are among
    the features listed by the authors. Two essential technologies utilized in smart
    farming are the internet of things and data analytics. The adoption of these 2
    technologies will determine whether smart agricultural systems are successful
    or unsuccessful in significant part. It is necessary to choose an appropriate
    and suitable strategy for smart farming since IoT and data analytics can be applied
    in various ways. Several of the methods covered in the literature are discussed
    in this section. A detailed breakdown of Smart Agriculture System techniques is
    provided in Table 1. The authors name, important details, suggested techniques,
    and advantages of the application are described in Table 1 below. Table 1 The
    comparative analysis of smart agricultural system Full size table 3 Methodology
    The Internet of Things protocols is the building blocks at the application, network,
    and perception levels [26]. The data-gathering control layer is layered beneath
    the perception layer’s module for continuously monitoring visual signals. These
    components are used to connect the greenhouse’s numerous multisensory, cameras,
    and controls. Sensors for light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, soil,
    and pH are all involved. Sensor data is gathered. A networking abstraction layer
    handles the delivery of requests to and receipt of requests by a cloud-hosted
    web server. Controller relays are the electrical components in charge of controlling
    the greenhouse’s temperature and humidity levels. These controller relays are
    referred to by their technical names. The network layer oversees these responsibilities,
    sensors thoughtfully placed at various locations throughout the greenhouse provide
    this information. A higher-level command is required for the controller to communicate
    with the awareness layer. Users of this cloud-based platform have access to a
    plethora of features. These features include the deployment of applications and
    the visualization of data. A web server, a database, and a cloud service are the
    three most common elements in an application’s presentation layer. This is since
    this layer houses the application’s user interface. PID controllers are used in
    engineering contexts more than any other controller design [27]. This rate outnumbers
    the use of any other controller design. The PID controller almost always uses
    the difference between the values set as the target and the values that the system
    is currently measuring as input. This difference is the difference between what
    the system is measuring now and what the target values are. Typically, a fuzzy
    controller has three output variables and two input variables. To control the
    temperature of the greenhouse, the controller’s fuzzy adaptive PID parameters
    must be adjusted online. By checking these values, we can confirm that they are
    suitable for temperature regulation. Duplicates and inconsistencies, as well as
    missing, abnormal, and redundant data, are common issues in the original data.
    If adequate pre-processing is not performed, the likelihood of the data mining
    attempt failing is significantly increased. Pre-processing must be completed before
    beginning the data mining process. This is necessary to ensure accurate data extraction
    during the mining process, which improves mining efficiency. Data cleansing, integration,
    transformation, and specification have been identified as the most critical steps
    in data pre-processing [28]. Intelligent agriculture systems can discover information,
    but it must first be retrieved and processed before it can be used. Intelligent
    agriculture systems can find information. The clustering method compiles related
    pieces of data into a single “cluster,“ and anomalies are isolated and eliminated.
    The -means algorithm has been used for a long time as a distance-based clustering
    algorithm [29]. This is because its position in relation to the initial cluster’s
    epicenter is fixed. Another issue is that the algorithm has difficulty finding
    clusters of objects that are highly similar. As a result, the algorithm can only
    be used in limited situations. It avoids the drawbacks of the algorithm by setting
    a threshold value and using the lowest priority technique to assess whether the
    data includes noise. The technique for determining the cluster’s center uses the
    furthest priority strategy k-means approach. It uses the “least crowded first”
    rule to figure out where the cluster’s center should be. Artificial regulation
    is still required when it comes to crop planting. A suitable management system
    must be running in the background before data can be collected inside the greenhouse.
    At any time, the requirements can be checked, and the system can be changed to
    meet those needs. Crop management is just one of many applications for the Internet
    of Things, and one of them is to enable more precise and effective crop management.
    In the background, there is now a system that provides artificial intelligence-related
    services. Both the management and business platforms are undergoing significant
    development now [30]. A schematic of the data warehouse is shown in Fig. 2. The
    ability of farmers to control the greenhouse from a distance, the speed with which
    the alert system can be turned off, the ease with which greenhouse conditions
    can be seen and understood, and the ability to set thresholds for all conditions
    are key parts of the business platform that makes their use possible. One of the
    most important uses of a management platform is to control who has access to what,
    keep tabs on and control devices in real time, and share data [31]. We’re developing
    a mobile client right now. Farmers will be able to check on and adjust the temperature
    and humidity in their greenhouses from afar. The status of their greenhouses may
    be monitored in real-time. Fig. 2 A Schematic Representation of the entire System
    Full size image Air temperature readings were taken on a regular basis while Flammulina
    velutipes were grown at a facility throughout the months of October 2020 and January
    2021. Data on soil temperature, humidity, and air temperature are included. Each
    of the four categories receives new data every minute. We collect 1,200 sets of
    data about full cycles, 1,000 of which are used for testing and 200 for training.
    The diagram shows how a comprehensive plan is developed to meet the needs of the
    greenhouse. The greenhouse can evaluate the current environment and make any necessary
    adjustments using built-in temperature and humidity sensors. During this time,
    the terminal can record the video and send it back for further processing and
    monitoring. It can also send back information about the weather and other conditions.
    This system gives the farmers complete control of the greenhouse’s automatic irrigation
    and lighting systems, allowing them to monitor them and make changes as needed.
    In a greenhouse, a detection system for Internet-of-Things-enabled devices. China’s
    ability to produce a diverse range of agricultural products, each with a distinct
    physical appearance, is one of its most notable selling points. Agricultural operations
    between the north and south cannot benefit from a unified mode and path selection.
    This is due to the impossibility of doing so. This is due to the significant temperature
    difference between the two regions of the country. The temperature inside the
    greenhouse can be raised in a variety of ways, including the installation of hot
    water pipes, heaters, and hot air vents. To reduce the temperature inside the
    greenhouse, either a sunshade is built, or a spray is applied. The spray was found
    to be significantly more effective than the other methods in lowering greenhouse
    temperatures. The installation of skylights in the greenhouse reduces the relative
    humidity of the environment. With the help of natural ventilation, you should
    be able to achieve your dehumidification goal and reduce relative humidity to
    a manageable level. Throughout the investigation, it became abundantly clear that
    either approach has the potential to be effective in raising the relative humidity
    levels contained within the greenhouse. The farmers believe that by adding a sunshade
    net to both the inside and outside of the greenhouse, they will be able to increase
    the intensity of the ambient light, which will help the plants grow. Evidence
    suggests that this configuration can effectively increase light intensity. On
    cloudy days, this prevents crops from being exposed to potentially harmful ultraviolet
    radiation from the sun while still providing adequate light. If this arrangement
    was not used, crops would be exposed to levels of ultraviolet radiation that could
    be harmful to them. This is not an impossible task because the instrument in question
    can increase the brightness of the light. A device capable of producing carbon
    dioxide gas is installed in the greenhouse to achieve the desired goal of maintaining
    the CO2 concentration at the same level. An automatic control system is used to
    regulate the valve that holds the liquid as sulfuric acid drips slowly into the
    linkage apparatus, which generates carbon dioxide. Now, the valve is also controlled
    by an automatic control system. The diagram depicts how various devices appropriate
    for the greenhouse environment, as well as the internet of things, can be used
    to regulate the temperature and humidity levels inside the structure. This allows
    for more precise maintenance of the conditions that promote plant growth. During
    the planning and preparation phases of the data and operation management hub,
    the farmers’ needs were considered. One of the most important tasks that fall
    under their purview is the overall management of the greenhouse, and as such,
    it is one of the tasks for which they are responsible, in addition to answering
    phones and running computers. The structure’s location is unimportant because
    the regulations apply equally whether the greenhouse is kept indoors or outdoors.
    Following that, a network of wireless sensors and a central processing unit are
    set up to collect and analyse data about the current environment and weather.
    The farmers are given the information after it has been charted, which is the
    very last step in the procedure. Farmers can easily access current information
    thanks to the data module that has been implemented. Users can view the data they’ve
    been tracking, such as time-lapse videos of significant greenhouse events, the
    status of individual greenhouse sections, and the status of equipment at any given
    time. This information is available to mobile device users. A system administrator
    will first make decisions based on the results of a thorough search of the information
    pertaining to farmer harvests. This search will be carried out to gain access
    to all the data. It has been demonstrated that using mobile phone users as clients
    is a viable option. The client is shown controlling the greenhouse with their
    smartphone. Farmers can use their phones to look up historical records about the
    situation. This method can drastically reduce the amount of time, effort, and
    resources required for farming. A precise control system can also increase crop
    yields, and the design can be used by other IoT-enabled agricultural businesses.
    The intelligent agriculture system’s data monitoring module is present, allowing
    real-time readings to be displayed on the screen. Temperature, humidity, carbon
    dioxide concentration, and light intensity were all measured inside the greenhouse.
    These values are as follows: This provides an accurate and detailed representation
    of the environmental conditions present in the greenhouse where the plants are
    grown. Simultaneously, video monitoring images can be used to gain a real-time
    inside look at what’s going on in the greenhouse. 4 Results and discussion In
    our proposed work, we introduce a fuzzy adaptive PID controller and clustering
    algorithm in an IoT-based intelligent greenhouse management system to efficiently
    manage greenhouse temperature and humidity. These technologies improve the accuracy
    of the system and enable increased crop yield and reduced energy usage. Additionally,
    we utilize a cloud-based platform and mobile app for real-time data visualization,
    analysis, and device control, which represents an innovative approach to greenhouse
    management. Traditional IoT-based agriculture monitoring systems often lacked
    efficient management of greenhouse temperature and humidity, which are critical
    factors for crop growth. Furthermore, they did not incorporate fuzzy adaptive
    PID control and clustering algorithms to improve the accuracy of the system. Additionally,
    traditional systems lacked real-time data visualization and device control, making
    it difficult for farmers to respond quickly to changes in the environment. Overall,
    our proposed work addresses the limitations of traditional IoT-based agriculture
    monitoring systems by introducing innovative technologies to improve greenhouse
    management and enable sustainable agriculture. Table 2 Comparison of Proposed
    Method with Traditional IoT-Based Agriculture Monitoring Systems Full size table
    Table 2 provides a comparison of the proposed IoT-based intelligent greenhouse
    management system with traditional IoT-based agriculture monitoring systems based
    on five parameters. The proposed system utilizes a fuzzy adaptive PID controller
    for temperature control, a clustering algorithm for data pre-processing, a cloud-based
    platform for real-time data visualization, and a mobile app for remote control.
    On the other hand, traditional systems utilize a fixed PID controller for temperature
    control and a local server for data visualization. The data in the table shows
    that the proposed system has several advantages over traditional systems. The
    use of a fuzzy adaptive PID controller and clustering algorithm improves the accuracy
    of the system, which is reflected in the increased crop yield. The proposed system
    also consumes less energy, making it more sustainable. Additionally, the system
    provides a cloud-based platform for real-time data visualization, which is more
    convenient than a local server, and a mobile app for remote control, which is
    more user-friendly than a web interface. In terms of cost, the proposed system
    has a moderate cost of implementation compared to traditional systems, which have
    a high cost of implementation. Overall, the proposed IoT-based intelligent greenhouse
    management system outperforms traditional IoT-based agriculture monitoring systems
    in terms of accuracy, energy consumption, crop yield, and user-friendliness, while
    remaining cost-effective. The elimination of noise from the dataset’s data is
    shown in Fig. 3, there are seven incorrect values in the data before the FPKM
    algorithm’s denoising processing is applied to them. After the FPKM algorithm
    has been run, the dataset is checked for weird values, and any that are found
    are taken out. Fig. 3 Improved Data Cleaning through FPKM Method Full size image
    A denoising algorithm’s efficacy is proportional to the number of repetitions
    it undergoes. The algorithm improves with fewer iterations. In Fig. 4, we observe
    how the FPKM method and the k -means fare when subjected to varying seed sizes
    and randomness. It is well known that the FPKM algorithms need considerably different
    amounts of time for every iteration. On the other hand, the FPKM method always
    employs an iteration time that is nearly double the beginning value. The algorithm’s
    number of iterations for determining the mean varies significantly. When utilizing
    partly random seeds, the mean approach takes more iterations than the FPKM technique.
    This implies that the number of times the mean method must be performed is significantly
    affected by the position of the initial clustering center. There is no doubt that
    these changes have made the FPKM algorithm work better. Fig. 4 Iteration Time
    for Each Algorithm with Random Seeds Full size image This market sector would
    not be possible without either of these components. Because of these two things,
    there is a lot of demand for greenhouse-grown plants. We investigated the necessary
    environmental factors in the greenhouse to gather the information required to
    build and then use the model. This enabled us to develop and apply the model.
    Table 3 shows the best cooking temperatures for a variety of vegetables. The figure
    depicts the recommended temperature ranges for cooking various vegetable preparations.
    These price ranges are listed below. As a result, the temperature of the greenhouse
    is adjusted to meet the needs of the various vegetables being grown as well as
    the outside temperature. The ability of various types of vegetables to withstand
    temperatures ranging from cold to semi-cold to warm to hot is one way to distinguish
    between the many different types of vegetables. A frost is more likely to kill
    vegetables that cannot withstand colder temperatures than it is to kill vegetables
    that can. There are numerous vegetable species that can withstand temperatures
    as low as 10 degrees Celsius. Garlic ranks sixth on the list of vegetables with
    the highest resistance to wilting, trailing only leeks, spinach, radicchio, and
    onions. These hardy vegetables do best in temperatures between 17 and 20 degrees
    Celsius, but they can also live for short periods of time in temperatures as low
    as 1 to 3 degrees Celsius. Table 3 Comparative analysis of Proposed system with
    other state of art Full size table Chinese cabbage, radishes, carrots, cabbage,
    peas, and broad beans are among the semi-cold-resistant vegetables that are readily
    available. Warm vegetables can only grow in temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius;
    cold vegetables cannot grow. When temperatures fall below 15 degrees Celsius,
    flowers are easily ripped from their stems. This phenomenon is known as frost
    heave. Temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius will have a negative impact on growth
    and yields. Warm vegetables include eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, beans, and cucumbers,
    to name a few. Plants that can withstand high heat can thrive and bear fruit even
    when temperatures reach 40 degrees Celsius temperatures of around 30 degrees Celsius
    are ideal. Some examples include winter melons, pumpkins, watermelons, cowpeas,
    beans, amaranth, and water spinach, another example is water spinach. Fig. 5 How
    Much Water Various Types of Vegetables Require While Growing Full size image Vegetables
    come in a wide range of varieties, each with its own set of temperature requirements.
    Figure 5 depicts the water demand for vegetable farming, while Fig. 6 depicts
    the water required for the growth of various vegetables. The graph shows the wide
    range of values for transpiration rates and water requirements among vegetable
    species. When using the traditional planting method, the rate of transpiration
    and the amount of water required for vegetable cultivation cannot be precisely
    measured. Fig. 6 Water Efficiency used by Vegetables Full size image This demonstrates
    the critical importance of implementing technology that can aid in detection and
    regulation via the Internet of Things. In the second section, we’ll discuss the
    various strategies that farmers have used in the past to successfully manage their
    businesses. The farmers are responsible for constantly monitoring the temperature,
    humidity, and carbon dioxide levels inside the greenhouses. Figure 6 highlights
    the water efficiency of different vegetables, demonstrating the need for precise
    regulation and detection of water levels. This emphasizes the importance of implementing
    IoT technology in agriculture to achieve optimal water efficiency and prevent
    wastage. Fig. 7 Temperature variance between the interior and exterior of the
    greenhouse Full size image Figure 7 demonstrates the effectiveness of the fuzzy
    adaptive PID algorithm in maintaining stable temperatures inside the greenhouse.
    The algorithm helps in controlling the temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide
    levels inside the greenhouse, thus improving crop yield and reducing energy usage.
    The results show that the proposed system can maintain a consistent temperature
    range, with a deviation of not more than 3 degrees Celsius, ensuring optimal crop
    growth. However, the proposed system has certain limitations that need to be addressed
    before its full potential can be realized. The system relies on a local server,
    limiting its scalability. Additionally, it focuses solely on tomato crops, which
    restricts its applicability to other crops. Furthermore, its accuracy requires
    testing under various environmental conditions to ensure it can perform well in
    different scenarios. Future research should aim to address these limitations and
    achieve the system’s objectives to revolutionize greenhouse management and enable
    sustainable agriculture. Farmers must make any necessary modifications as soon
    as possible. The effectiveness of a fuzzy adaptive PID algorithm used by the greenhouse
    system’s performance controller is investigated and shown in Fig. 7. The greenhouse
    temperature has consistently ranged between 18.0 and 21.0 degrees Celsius, and
    the indoor temperature has never deviated from the desired rate of change by more
    than 3 degrees Celsius. The temperature outside the greenhouse’s shield is steadily
    rising after two hours of observation. The results show that the fuzzy adaptive
    PID algorithm-based greenhouse system controller can keep the greenhouse’s temperature
    stable. Proposed intelligent agriculture monitoring and management system has
    limitations to address before reaching its full potential. These include limited
    scalability due to reliance on a local server. It also focuses solely on tomato
    crops, which restricts its applicability to other crops. Furthermore, its accuracy
    requires testing under various environmental conditions. Future research should
    aim to address these limitations and achieve the system’s objectives. 5 Conclusion
    The integration of IoT technologies and the development of intelligent agriculture
    systems have brought about significant advancements in the agriculture industry.
    The utilization of various components and protocols at different levels, coupled
    with pre-processing techniques, has enabled farmers to collect and analyse data
    in real-time, leading to improved crop yields, reduced water consumption, and
    increased energy efficiency. Moreover, the integration of artificial intelligence-related
    services into the management and business platforms has provided farmers with
    more precise and effective crop management, including the ability to control greenhouse
    environmental conditions remotely. The study conducted an analysis of the agricultural
    sector, evaluating the performance of a proposed real-time agriculture monitoring
    system, denoting the dataset, and identifying optimal temperature ranges and water
    requirements for different types of vegetables. The findings provide valuable
    insights into environmental factors critical to greenhouse farming, enabling farmers
    to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to sustainable and profitable farming
    practices. As the world’s population continues to grow, the demand for food will
    only increase. Therefore, the integration of IoT technologies and the development
    of intelligent agriculture systems will play an increasingly vital role in meeting
    this demand sustainably. By improving efficiency and reducing waste, farmers can
    grow more food with fewer resources. The development of intelligent agriculture
    systems provides hope for a future where food security is achievable, and farming
    practices are sustainable, efficient, and profitable. References Jin, Y. R., &

  description: Soil moisture plays an important role in crop yield estimation, irrigation
    management, etc. Remote sensing technology has potential for large-scale and high
    spatial soil moisture mapping. However, offline remote sensing data processing
    is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and significantly hampers the efficiency
    and timeliness of soil moisture mapping. Due to the high-speed computing capabilities
    of remote sensing cloud platforms, a High Spatial Resolution Soil Moisture Estimation
    Framework (HSRSMEF) based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was developed
    in this study. The functions of the HSRSMEF include research area and input datasets
    customization, radar speckle noise filtering, optical-radar image spatio-temporal
    matching, soil moisture retrieving, soil moisture visualization and exporting.
    This paper tested the performance of HSRSMEF by combining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2
    images and in-situ soil moisture data in the central farmland area of Jilin Province,
    China. Reconstructed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on the
    Savitzky-Golay algorithm conforms to the crop growth cycle, and its correlation
    with the original NDVI is about 0.99 (P < 0.001). The soil moisture accuracy of
    the random forest model (R 2 = 0.942, RMSE = 0.013 m3/m3) is better than that
    of the water cloud model (R 2 = 0.334, RMSE = 0.091 m3/m3). HSRSMEF transfers
    time -consuming offline operations to cloud computing platforms, achieving rapid
    and simplified high spatial resolution soil moisture mapping.

    modellingCrop coefficientSweet basil 1. Introduction Population and economic growth,
    along with increased climate variability puts water resources under pressure.
    Focusing on Europe, annual renewable freshwater resources are generous, amounting
    to a long-term average of 4,560 m3 per capita. For example, Italy is the third
    largest agricultural producer contributing to the highest value-added agriculture
    in the European Union (CREA, 2021) but ranked 84th among 180 countries based on
    internal freshwater resources per capita according to AQUASTAT. Hence, irrigation
    management is to be optimized in soil and soilless cultivation. To improve control
    over the growing environment, we subsequently focus on soilless culture cultivation.
    Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is an annual aromatic herbal plant belonging
    to the family of Lamiaceae. Basil is an aromatic plant commonly used in the Mediterranean
    cuisine (Makri & Kintzios, 2008). Due to its high content of essential oils, phenolic
    compounds, flavonoids (Jayasinghe et al., 2003) and antioxidant activities, basil
    has also many applications in medicine (Puccinelli et al., 2020). However, little
    is known about its water requirements in greenhouse soilless culture (Khater et
    al., 2021). Crop evapotranspiration (ET) is considered as one of the fundamental
    variables for irrigation management. Many models for ET estimation have been developed
    over the last thirty years. These models are commonly classified as either “one-step”
    or “two-step” approach (Shuttleworth, 2006). The first allows direct estimation
    of ET based on the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation (Monteith, 1965). The latter
    is based on defining a reference crop ET and then using an experimental crop coefficient,
    to quantify the difference between the two crops (Allen et al., 1998). Virtues
    and vices of both approaches are evident. The P-M equation is universally accepted
    by the scientific community as the theoretically superior one-step approach. The
    P-M equation depends on aerodynamic and canopy resistances relative to meteorological
    controls which are, however, cumbersome to obtain. Hence, the P-M equation is
    scarcely used, in practice. For applications in greenhouses, (Baille et al., 1994).
    proposed a simplified version of the P-M equation that only depends on the meteorological
    parameters Global Radiation (GR) and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) plus the Leaf
    Area Index (LAI) of the crop. Further simplifications of the P-M equation were
    proposed subsequently (Bacci et al., 2011, Carmassi et al., 2007). Nevertheless,
    all these P-M based equations need to be calibrated before their use. Specifically,
    knowledge of weather-related data, (destructive) LAI and crop ET measurements
    are required during a minimum of two growing cycles, consequently consuming time
    and resources. During validation phase, LAI is then assumed to be known i.e.,
    perfectly estimated, which is the hitch of this approach. The FAO-56 version of
    the P-M ET equation is a practical two-step approach (Allen et al., 1998) comprising
    the reference crop ETo of a well-watered hypothetical grass times an empirical
    single crop-coefficient Kc = Kc(t) curve, incorporating crop characteristics and
    its development stage. During calibration, the former factor can be easily calculated
    from data on temperature, relative humidity, and GR. The latter, behaving similar
    to the LAI over time, can be simply computed as the ratio of actual crop ET to
    the previously obtained reference ETo. Before the previously obtained Kc curve
    is ready for crop ET estimation, however, we must not only identify the time point
    in the respective crop stage but also adjust the Kc curve for climatic conditions,
    limiting the merit of this two-step approach. Some authors (Fernández et al.,
    2011, Gallardo et al., 2013) reviewed application of the FAO-56 method to Mediterranean
    greenhouse conditions. Their study on ETo estimation for perennial grass using
    drainage lysimeter shows that the FAO-56 P-M ET equation underestimates the reference
    ET by 21 %. Simpler methods for estimating ETo, restricting their input variables
    to the daily min/max temperature (Hargreaves & Samani, 1985) or, the daily sum
    of external solar radiation values (Almeria Radiation method), yield similar accuracy.
    Ergo, there is still lack of a simple yet accurate method for fast crop ET estimation,
    especially when it comes to sweet basil. The key to effective model prediction
    is to approximate the complex dynamics of the underlying dynamics as stochastic
    process. The unsupervised machine learns the model autonomously without external
    training data, which is time efficient but hard to achieve. The supervised machine
    builds a statistical model from training data. Once trained, the machine can make
    repeatable predictions. The model parameters are static. They do not change over
    time. Following the latter approach, (Goap et al., 2018) propose the use of support
    vector regression machine for crop ET prediction. Recently, Artificial Neural
    Networks (ANNs) comprising many simple connected nodes dubbed neurons can be used
    to predict parameters related to precision farming (Balducci et al., 2018). Among
    the many types of available ANNs, it is worth pointing out the recurrent neural
    network (RNN). Its feedback structure allows for space–time prediction of system
    parameters such as the LAI (Chen et al., 2015). Though the prediction accuracy
    is promising, these ANNs require large amount of data along with the ground truth
    for training, which requires manual work of experts to be obtained. To overcome
    this drawback, recent research has focused on semi supervised machine learning
    methods. Starting from a few training points, the underlying system model exploits
    forthcoming observations in the same data frame to adjust itself as time passes
    thanks to modern information and communication technology. For example, the dynamic
    Bayesian network in (Kocian et al., 2020a, Kocian et al., 2020b) models the time-series
    of crop ET values as Markov process with the weather-related parameters as (known)
    disturbance. This approach, however, yields good results only when future weather
    events are anticipated correctly. This is not always the case, especially in the
    Mediterranean winter and spring time, characterized by strong variability in the
    climate. With the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), machine learning applications
    for precision farming have been grown rapidly over the past years (Mekonnen et
    al., 2020). IoT senses huge amount of heterogeneous data from smart sensors and
    devices (“things”) related to crop, soil, and weather. The resulting data stream
    is transmitted over the wireless channel to some cloud server for advanced analytics,
    real-time visualizations, and machine learning. The latter feeds the mathematical
    crop water model. An agent, making smarter predictions over time, might return
    control information to the actuators in the greenhouse (Burchi et al., 2018).
    In such a closed-loop system, sensor data might feed in the forward loop a machine
    learning algorithm. The predicted nominal soil moisture from weather forecast
    acts as control information in the feedback loop. The sprinkler starts at a predefined
    minimum soil moisture and stops at the returned nominal value (Goap et al., 2018).
    The controller might also choose one out of many tasks in order to maximize the
    cumulative reward (Bu & Wang, 2019). Clearly, each task (such as the sprinkler)
    in the IoT network must respond within a predefined deadline, on average at least.
    Quality of Service (QoS) in the field of IoT manages system capabilities and its
    resources but has gained only low attention until recently (Brogi & Forti, 2017).
    One way to handle the performance of IoT networks is to model them as synchronous
    data flow (SDF) graph that is transformed into a directed acyclic workflow graph,
    revealing the timing of individual tasks (Kocian & Chessa, 2022) QoS aware IoT
    has not entered as an application in smart farming, yet. In this contribution,
    we follow a dynamic Bayesian approach to modeling a crop coefficient confined
    to radiation and derive a predictor for its a posteriori probability over time.
    Input data from only three Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sensors, measuring
    temperature, global radiation and crop weight, are required. Treating GR as parameter
    rather than a variable, a guess of crop ET can be retrieved directly from the
    predicted time-series by scaling. The result is immune to errors from weather
    forecasting in contrast to common predictors that directly operate on crop ET.
    Neither time consuming training cycles nor destructive LAI measurements are necessary
    for this model to work correctly. For the hardware realization, a few simple sensors,
    measuring temperature, global radiation, and weight balance, are connected to
    a lightweight IoT client, operating in soft real-time. Measurement data is forwarded
    to the IoT cloud where this model is implemented. To get basic insight into the
    end-to-end QoS behavior, we represent the soft real-time IoT network as synchronous
    data flow graph. The performance of our model is tested for sweet basil and compared
    with that of the common (static) Baille technique across climates and different
    data sampling techniques. The performance of our IoT network is assessed by means
    of the QoS metrics response time, jitter, and availability. The results are compared
    with the respective requirements. 2. Evapotranspiration models 2.1. Static standard
    approach We preliminary recap a standard approach to static ET estimation in greenhouse
    horticulture. It is shown in (Carmassi et al., 2007) that the daily average [mm
    d-1] can be approximated by a linear combination of the daily global radiation
    [MJ m−2 d-1], daily LAI [1] and latent heat of water vaporization λ [MJ kg−1],
    (1) Finally, k is the light extinction coefficient of the canopy, which is important
    for an appropriate partitioning of radiant energy between crop canopy and soil
    surfaces. The (static) coefficients a [1] and b [mm d-1] are the regression coefficients
    that are to be computed by means of linear regression analysis during some training
    cycle. On top of that, the expression for in (1) requires knowledge on daily LAI
    of the crop. The evolution of the latter can be obtained by (destructive or non-destructive)
    field measurements or regression models which we follow subsequently. A standard
    approach to LAI modeling requires a nonlinear, typically exponential, logistic,
    or Gaussian, regression with the cumulative Growing Degree Days (GDD) as explanatory
    variables (Thornley & Johnson Ian, 1990), (2) from planting to harvesting. The
    (static) regression coefficients c and d are obtained by measurement during the
    same training cycle. Note that the expression for in (1), dubbed “simplified Baille
    model”, is valid for the calibrated crop type within the training range of temperature
    and global radiation, only. The regression coefficients are static; they do not
    adapt over time. 2.2. Dynamic Bayesian approach Most of current prediction models
    for evapotranspiration consider the crop ET as figure of merit. Following this
    approach, ET can be predicted with high quality if future weather events can be
    anticipated correctly. This is often cumbersome when weather changes quickly,
    especially in the (Mediterranean) winter season. To overcome this shortcoming,
    we consider (3) a (dimensionless) crop coefficient Kr, confined to global radiation
    at time instant t, as figure of merit. From the simplified Baille model in (1),
    it can be readily seen that the Kr resembles the LAI which is related to the growing
    season rather than weather phenomena. The way in which LAI is modeled in (2) suggests
    that the Kr evolves over time according to (4) with the system parameters ν, κ,
    t0, and µ. Note that for leafy plants, such as basil, the evolution of the Kr
    is near-linear (Guerra et al., 2016) i.e., µ 0. Sampling (4) with granularity
    Δ, it follows (5) Slightly rearranging (5), we have (6) Note that above expression
    is solution to a first-order linear difference equation. Let Kr be a time-discrete
    Markov process containing the random variables Kr1 … KrT that cannot be observed
    directly, but only through noisy measurement y =  . Then, the probability of moving
    from state to state is given by (7) t = 1…T. Here, denotes a Gaussian distribution
    of the first argument having mean m and covariance. Moreover, are the system parameters.
    The deterministic (known) control data ut comprises the ambient temperature at
    time instant t. The conditional probability of measuring given state has the form
    (8) t = 1…T. Here, denotes a system parameter. For the distribution of the initial
    state, we have (9) The state-space system (7) - (9) corresponds to a Dynamic Bayesian
    Network. The iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to track
    the posterior state sequence as well as the set of system parameters . Mean and
    covariance of the free running q-step predictor without response are, after a
    few straightforward algebraic operations, (10) respectively. In the derivation
    of (10) we treated missing data at random (Rubin, 1976). The hat operator on the
    respective symbols indicates their estimate at iterative convergence. We modeled
    Kr as stochastic process that account for variations in climate. As these variations
    are small compared to weather variations, we expect that our Kr approach predicts
    crop evapotranspiration with much higher accuracy than the Baille based ET approach
    does. 3. The IoT network Usually crop water models require input data. We could
    measure the parameters manually in the field. This approach, however, has several
    hitches ranging from data storage to security issues. Scheduling of manual measurement
    24/7 itself is a challenge. We therefore follow an automatic approach using IoT
    condition monitoring. Also, our crop water models shall be updated automatically
    at the end of the day. 3.1. Requirements The IoT platform shall meet the following
    requirements: • Autonomy: The IoT network can carry out its tasks alone without
    human interaction. • Consistency: The sensed data must be reproducible. • Economic:
    COTS components shall be used. A standard Lithium-ion Polymer battery (3.7 V DC,
    1800mAh) shall be sufficient to power the IoT client. • Memory: The executable
    must fit in the flash memory of the IoT client, which is about 100kB. • Real-Time:
    Real-time support opens up the possibility of using threads, timers and pre-emptive
    multitasking. • Backup and restore: To recover from failure, the IoT application
    must be able to back up its state during normal operation and restore its last
    state after reboot from error. • Robustness: The IoT application must be able
    to recover autonomously from error. 3.2. System design Following this approach,
    Fig. 1 shows a high-level concept of the system architecture. A few sensors are
    connected to the Particle™ micro-controller with cellular capability, forming
    an embedded IoT client. Once a while, the micro-controller wakes up, reads the
    sensor signals, processes their data and pushes the result to the cloud using
    event driven webhooks, and then goes to sleep again. To ensure data privacy over
    air transmission, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) with Datagram Transport
    Layer Security (DTLS) lets our sensors communicate on the IoT. In the cloud, the
    ThingSpeak™ IoT platform feeds our machine learning algorithm using MATLAB™ functions
    and toolboxes. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. IoT-based system architecture comprising sensors connected
    to a client with cellular connectivity and a cloud platform performing data aggregation,
    analytics, and machine learning. The firmware in the IoT client is subdivided
    into tasks that are scheduled synchronously in a periodic fashion by the real-time
    operating system FreeRTOS, maintaining certain quality-of-service (QoS) functionalities.
    Though FreeRTOS is deterministic, the communication with all the sensors occurs
    asynchronously in separate threads, introducing uncertainty in the tasks’ response
    time. On top of that, delay caused by the wireless channel is inherently stochastic,
    as well. As each task consumes and produces data samples, the concept of Synchronous
    Data Flow (SDF) with random execution times is ideally suited for workflow modelling
    of our application (Kocian & Chessa, 2022). The SDF graph for one period of execution
    is depicted in Fig. 2. Each node in the graph represents one independent task
    an having (stochastic) execution time TEn. Edges in the graph indicate the dependence
    among the nodes. The number on the stem and the arrow on each edge indicate the
    respective incoming and outgoing rates. Download : Download high-res image (101KB)

    connected to one cloud server during one period of execution. Inspecting Fig.
    2, the tasks are to be executed in sequential order {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6} within
    an infinite loop, starting with temperature/humidity (T/H) sensing node. The second
    node senses solar radiation (GR) sensor. The third node senses the crop’s weight
    to compute its daily evapotranspiration (ET). The transmitter (Tx) prepares for
    transmission, and metadata are sent over the wireless channel (Channel) to the
    cloud server where the data is aggregated (Aggregation). In the same order the
    individual nodes’ execution times are to be added, to form the execution profile
    of the entire IoT network. In Section 4, we will use above SDF graph to evaluate
    several QoS metrics related to our IoT network. Note that our mathematical models
    are executed asynchronously at the end of the day and hence, are not part of above
    SDF graph. 3.3. Experimental design Several experiments were conducted in two
    subsequent years (2019 and 2020) at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment
    at the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy (latitude 43°42′ N, longitude 10°24′ E).
    Ventilation in our greenhouses occurred by openings along the roof edges. Sweet
    Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) plants were cultivated in plastic pots (18 cm diameter;
    3 L of volume) filled with perlite-peat mixture (1:1 v/v) at a density of 12 plants
    m−2. Sweet basil seeds (Franchi Seeds, Bergamo, Italy) were sown in 240-cell plug-trays
    filled with rockwool (Grodan®) and vermiculite; the trays were placed in a growth
    chamber at 23–25 °C and 60–70 % of relative humidity for 4–5 days. Basil plants
    were put it the greenhouse at four leaves stage (approximately 20 days). The plants
    were irrigated on daily basis (1–2 min) using drip irrigation with a nutrient
    solution with the following nutrient ion composition expressed as mol m−3: N-NO3-
    10.0, N-NH4+ 0.5, H2PO4- 1.0, K+ 6.0, Mg2+ 2.0, Ca2+ 4.0, Na+ 0.5, SO42− 3.5,
    Cl- 0.5, and as micro-mol m−3 Fe2+ 40, Cu2+ 1.0, Zn2+ 5.0, Mn2+ 10.0, B 25.0,
    Mo3+ 1.0. The Electrical Conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution was 2.30 dS
    m−1, and the pH was adjusted to 5.50 with diluted sulfuric acid. Above experiments
    were conducted in a warm greenhouse (heating threshold 15 °C) between 15th November
    2019 and 23rd March 2020 with four different basil cultivation cycles in four
    different microclimatic environments, labeled as “Cycle 1” to “Cycle 4”., Table
    1 lists the descriptive statistics of the control parameters during the experiments.

    temperature and air humidity; the solar radiation sensor by Netsens, Sesto Fiorentino,
    Tuscany, Italy; and the load cells in form of a Wheatstone bridge, supporting
    20 kg. For the IoT client, we deploy the STM32F205 ARM Cortex M3 micro-controller
    by the Particle™ Electron series. The mathematical models are implemented in Matlab™.
    The number of iterations in the Expectation Maximization algorithm is limited
    to 100. 3.4. Calibration issues 3.4.1. Simplified Baille model The simplified
    Baille model described in Section 2.1 must be calibrated, to determine the regression
    parameters a, b, c and d. To obtain robust parameter estimates that are valid
    for a large range of environmental parameters, we generated two independent training
    datasets apart from the actual test dataset. Trials for model calibration were
    conducted between 1st April 2019 and 14th May 2019 in two different experimental
    environments. Environment 1 (dubbed “ENV 1”) and Environment 2 (dubbed “ENV 2”)
    were a warm greenhouse with a high level of solar radiation and a shaded greenhouse
    with emergency heating, respectively. Specifically, the daily average of cumulative
    global radiation and the air temperature were 11.78 MJ m−2 day−1 and 22.32 °C;
    4.27 MJ m−2 day−1 and 17.21 °C, respectively, in ENV 1 and ENV 2. Table 2 shows
    the descriptive statistics of the control parameters during training. Table 2.

    has been used to determine the leaf area in both environments. Five plants were
    randomly chosen on each of the 0th, 21st and 43rd Growing Day after Transplant
    (GDT). The resulting data samples are shown in Fig. 3, and so is the minimum mean
    square error LAI curve fit with respect to the GDD for a base temperature of 11
    °C (Walters & Currey, 2019). Download : Download high-res image (132KB) Download

    and growing degree days (GDD) for greenhouse basil grown in soilless substrate.
    The plants were cultivated in two different climatic environments. Environments
    ENV 1 (white circle), ENV 2 (black circle). Following this approach, the optimum
    regression coefficients in the linear regression of (2) are c = 0.01281 and d
    = 0.006627 (R2 = 0.98; n = 6). The calibration dataset (n = 86) has then been
    used to compute the regression coefficients a and b of the ET model in (1) using
    the calibrated LAI regression along with a light extinction coefficient k = 0.8
    (Solbach et al., 2021) Following this approach, the optimum regression coefficients
    in the linear regression of (1) result in a = 0.4484 and b = 0.1259 mm d-1. 3.4.2.
    Dynamic Bayesian model The EM algorithm, in contrast, requires only a few training
    data points embedded in the measurement data of the current cultivation cycle.
    However, inappropriate initialization parameters drive the EM to a sub-optimal
    local maximum of the log-likelihood function (Hu et al., 2004), instead. To obtain
    a robust initial estimate, though, let us revisit the (non-linear) system model
    in (4) containing three unknown parameters. Suppose three training points y1,
    y2, and y3 embedded anywhere in the data frame. Inserting these points in (4)
    at EM iteration 0, we have (11) as a possible solution to the regression problem.
    Comparing coefficients between the discrete system model in (6) and the corresponding
    state-space system in (7), (8), (9), it follows (12) The remaining parameters
    are less crucial for the performance of the EM algorithm and hence, are chosen
    simply as C0 = I, . 3.5. Figures of merit In this section, we define figures of
    merit that measure quality of the mathematical models as well as QoS of the IoT
    network. For the mathematical models, the gap between estimated (E) and measured
    (M) data is evaluated by the following standard figures of merit (Loague & Green,
    1991): • Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (13) • Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency
    coefficient (EF) (14) • Coefficient of Residuals Mass (CRM) (15) The estimated
    data corresponds to the measured when RMSE, EF and CRM are zero, one, and zero,
    respectively. For the IoT network, we focus on the QoS metrics average execution
    time µE [s], jitter [s2] and availability in [%]. When the nodes in the graph
    are executed in successive order, it can be readily shown that the execution time
    TE of an IoT application is the sum of the individual execution times. From the
    linearity property of expectation, the application’s expected execution time is
    the sum (16) where denotes the expectation of the argument. Analogously, the application’s
    variance in execution time, the jitter, is given by (17) For the system availability,
    we follow the common definition of uptime to runtime ratio in per cent. 4. Experimental
    results and discussion Given the environmental parameters in Table 1, we observed
    the following agronomic crop parameters during the four experiments. The total
    fresh weight was 225.36 ± 8.96 g plant−1, 325.74 ± 15.96 g plant−1, 340.46 ± 14.52
    g plant−1 and 347.98 ± 21.64 g plant−1 in Cycle 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The
    electric conductivity in the drainage water oscillated between 3.56 and 4.11 dS
    m−1 with a mean value of 3.93 ± 0.15 dS m−1 during all experiments. The measured
    cumulative water consumption was 10.05, 16.58, 13.45, and 12.66 mm day−1 in Cycle
    1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. To get started, we investigate the performance the
    simplified Baille technique in (1). Having trained the regression coefficients
    during two separate training cycles, we are now ready to deploy the model. Fig.
    4 shows the relationship between estimated and measured crop ET for all four cultivation
    cycles. A linear regression represented as solid line has also been added to the
    plot. Download : Download high-res image (219KB) Download : Download full-size

    (ET) for sweet basil grown in substrate culture in different climatic environments
    using the simplified Baille technique. The solid line represents the linear regression
    between estimated and measured ET while the dashed line is the 1:1 relationship;
    n = 96. RMSE, EF, and CRM of the linear regression model are given by 0.20, 0.63
    and −0.15, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.94 (n = 96
    values) with a slope of 1.09 and a point of intercept of 0.0297, indicating a
    negligible bias but slight overestimation of ET. Nevertheless, the simplified
    Baille model overcomes the challenges arising from determination of plant related
    variables such as leaf resistances. Only (destructive) LAI and weather-related
    measurement data are required. Finally, it is worth pointing out that the correlation
    coefficient r between GR and VPD is given by r = 0.69 justifying the missing VPD
    term in the expression for the crop ET in (1). Models that skip some of the parameters
    in the P-M ET equation implicitly assume a correlation among those missing (Katsoulas
    & Stanghellini, 2019). The performance of our state-space system is evaluated
    next. To get started, let us plot the time-series of data samples in Fig. 5 for
    a sampling granularity Δ = 1 day and a prediction length q = 1 day. Starting from
    the planting time, 0 days after planting (DAP = 0), the EM algorithm trains the
    parameters of our state-space system and tracks its states until DAP = 9. The
    re-estimated Kr time-series, dubbed “tracking”, is depicted as dotted curve in
    the graph. Beyond DAP = 9, the Kr predictor in (10) is in action. Its mean value
    is depicted as solid line that is surrounded by shaded confidence intervals of
    68 %. The ET time-series provided by the simplified Baille technique model in
    (1), has been added to the graph as dashed line. The measured crop ET values are
    represented by circle symbols. To be able to compare our Kr predictor with the
    ET estimator by Baille, we scaled Kr by the measured of the respective day and
    added the result to the plot as dash-dotted line dubbed “Predicted ET”. Download

    Comparison between measured (symbols), trained (dotted line), and predicted (solid
    line) values of daily crop evapotranspiration (ET) for the proposed state-space
    system, and the simplified Baille technique (dashed line). Sampling granularity
    Δ = 1 day, prediction length q = 1 day. For all four cultivation cycles, we observe
    a steadily increasing Kr curve of small curvature but with ripples vs time, mainly
    due to the variations in ambient temperature. The difference in Kr value reflects
    the difference in growth state in the respective climatic environment. The predicted
    ET curve matches the measured to a great extent even when the weather conditions
    change drastically from one day to another, especially in “Cycle 3”. The main
    reason for this behavior is that any error in the reconstruction of crop ET has
    no impact on the underlying Kr curve, on which the EM algorithm operates. For
    the simplified Baille curve, we observe that it correctly catches the trend of
    crop ET with slight overestimation in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4. Fig. 6 visualizes the
    predicted vs measured crop ET data with the cultivation cycle as parameter. The
    trendline has a slope of 0.99 and a point of intercept of 0.0023 (R2 = 0.84) indicating
    high average prediction accuracy over the entire time frame for all growing cycles
    representing different climatic environments. The statistical figures of merit
    RMSE, EF, and CRM are equal to 0.108, 0.845, and −0.0019, respectively, for all
    cultivation cycles, indicating a good model efficiency and a near optimum residual
    mass. The proposed state-space model clearly outperforms the simplified Baille
    model. Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download full-size

    system. Parameters: sampling granularity Δ = 1 day, prediction length q = 1 day.
    So far, we investigated the performance during four successive growing cycles
    requiring 96 consecutive days of measurement. It would be interesting to know
    the performance during four (pseudo) parallel sessions. This approach would only
    require one and the same set of measurement equipment for a duration of 26 consecutive
    days of measurement (see Table 1). Note that the longest cycle determines the
    overall duration in a parallel system. Following this approach, we start with
    the same dataset but take only one data sample from each cultivation cycle in
    round robin fashion. This scenario corresponds to a (virtual) sampling period
    of Δ = 4 days with missing samples during 3 consecutive days in between. The first
    three data points of each cycle are used for training so that the EM algorithm
    may start off between DAP = 9 (Cycle 4) and DAP = 12 (Cycle 1). Fig. 7 shows the
    Kr and ET times-series using the same line-style and symbols as Fig. 5 does. For
    comparison purposes, the simplified Baille model from the previous example (ingeniously
    knowing the environmental parameters occurring every day) has also been added
    to the plot. We observe that the reconstructed crop ET values by our state-space
    model (via Kr) still follow the measured ET values, though sensing information
    is missing every time for three days. The main reason for this behavior is that
    weather hardly impacts the shape of the Kr time-series. The statistical figures
    of merit RMSE, EF and CRM are 0.099, 0.59, and 0.032, respectively which are only
    slightly worse than in the previous scenario where data was available each day.

    (solid line) values of daily crop evapotranspiration (ET) for the proposed state-space
    system, and the simplified Baille technique (dashed line). Parameters: sampling
    granularity Δ = 4 days, prediction length q = 4 days. Finally, we test the IoT
    performance. For the IoT client, the firmware resembles the functionality outlined
    in Fig. 2. On top of that, each node in the graph adds a timestamp to its data.
    The result occupies 22,036 Bytes of Flash memory and 3816 Bytes of RAM, satisfying
    the requirements. From the timestamps of the individual nodes in the graph, the
    IoT client’s execution time profile can be readily obtained. The timings’ first
    and second order statistics are summarized in Table 3. The bottleneck in this
    implementation is clearly Node a3 (ET) as well Node a4 (Tx). Sensing from load
    cells and processing its data in the former node takes most of the time while
    transmitting data to the cloud in the latter node has most uncertainty. Table

    1.027 0.015 a4 (Tx) 0.95 0.60 The execution time profile of the entire IoT application
    is shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the distribution is centered around  =
    23 s. The standard deviation  = 1.6 s (jitter  = 2.65 s2), implying that the wireless
    channel adds a few more seconds of delay and some second square of jitter to the
    overall execution time. In any case, almost all data is aggregated in the cloud
    within a window of 25 s. Hence, we set the maximum response time to 25 s, to limit
    power consumption of our (battery powered) IoT client. For the system availability,
    we observed that sometimes the internet networks failed, at other times the Thingspeak™
    cloud was out of order. In total, the system was up 233.2 h out of a window of
    240 h (10 days) running time, corresponding to an availability of 97.2 %. Considering
    that our state-space model is immune to random missing data, this figure is excellent.

    cloud service via Particle™ clout interface. 5. Conclusions Over the last thirty
    years there have been proposed many crop water use models, to predict irrigation
    requirements. Unfortunately, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches “freeze”
    the model parameters during time-consuming training cycles or require destructive
    leaf-area-index measurements. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed to model
    a crop coefficient confined, Kr, to global radiation as Markov process with the
    daily air temperature as (known) disturbance. A state-space system describes the
    time-series of Kr for soilless cultivation. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm
    was used to compute the parameters of the system as well as to track its states.
    Finally, we derived a predictor for the posteriori probability of Kr. It turned
    out that the predicted Kr values are immune to erroneous weather forecasting.
    Treating GR as parameter rather than a variable, a guess of crop ET can be retrieved
    directly from the predicted time-series by scaling (without influencing the underlying
    Kr curve). We executed our model within the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm.
    A lightweight IoT-client from the Particle™ family, operating in soft real-time,
    collected data from a temperature/humidity sensor as well as a weighing scale,
    processed and transmitted the result over the wireless channel which is inherently
    stochastic. The ThingSpeak™ cloud is used to aggregate and visualize the collected
    data via web-interface. Our water crop use model, implemented in Matlab™ interacted
    with the ThingSpeak™ channel at the end of each day. To manage its resources,
    our IoT client was made quality-of-service (QoS) aware. The IoT network was modeled
    as synchronous data flow graph, to easily evaluate the QoS metrics response time,
    jitter and availability. Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) was used to test the
    performance of approach in four different climatic environments and two different
    data sampling strategies: i) sample daily from the same environment in parallel;
    ii) sample daily from one environment and move on to the next in round robin fashion,
    emulating reuse of the same set of measurement equipment. We found that the latter
    strategy is the most economic approach. On top of that, our Kr-based crop ET predictor
    outperforms the competing Baille model, in both cases. The proposed predictor
    is a first step to robust and fully autonomous crop water use anticipation without
    the need of an expert nor manual training cycles in contrast to the renown Baille
    technique. CRediT authorship contribution statement Alexander Kocian: Writing

    Location: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia SECTION I. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic
    in 2020 has already passed, but in 2023, we are faced with a transition towards
    normalization that has the potential to disrupt the availability, stability, and
    access to food crops. About 27 countries are experiencing the threat of a food
    crisis caused by the dependence on food supply chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Although the potential crisis in Indonesia is not as severe as in other countries
    like the Philippines and the Caribbean, this situation still needs to be monitored
    [1]. Apart from the impact of COVID-19, climate change also affects agricultural
    productivity, which leads to a decrease in food security levels. This combination
    of factors highlights the need for innovative solutions to ensure food production
    and security. One such solution is urban farming, which is an activity that utilizes
    land and space to produce agricultural products in urban areas. Urban farming
    presents an opportunity to address food shortages and contribute to local food
    production. One of the methods used in urban farming is through the utilization
    of greenhouses. A greenhouse is a structure designed to manipulate the environmental
    conditions for desired plant growth. By using a greenhouse, plants can thrive
    even in unpredictable weather and climate conditions, thereby minimizing the risk
    of crop failure [2], However, the use of greenhouses is not fully optimized as
    conventional manual techniques are still predominantly employed, such as watering
    plants based on visual observations of dry soil surface and plants, without considering
    the temperature and plant conditions. Similarly, fertilization is usually carried
    out according to predetermined schedules. Research conducted by Smith highlights
    the importance of considering temperature and humidity for optimal plant growth.
    For example, pakchoi plants have an ideal temperature range of 18-24 degrees Celsius,
    while the optimal relative humidity falls within the range of 50-70% [3]. Extreme
    temperatures, whether too low or too high, can impede plant growth and induce
    stress in pakchoi plants. In addition, excessively low or high humidity can lead
    to issues such as diseases and growth disturbances. To address these issues, an
    innovation has been developed by designing a device for monitoring temperature,
    soil moisture and humidity that utilizes Web of Things (WoT) technology. This
    innovation, called WUFARM, provides convenient access and flexible control, even
    from a distance. With the help of WUFARM, urban farmers can monitor and adjust
    the temperature and humidity levels within their greenhouses remotely, ensuring
    optimal growing conditions for their crops. This technology allows families to
    have full control over their own food production, reducing reliance on external
    food supplies and ensuring the availability of fresh and high-quality food. Furthermore,
    urban farming solutions like WUFARM can contribute to post-pandemic environmental
    sustainability by reducing food transportation distances, carbon emissions, and
    negative environmental impacts. By growing food locally within urban areas, the
    need for long-distance transportation is minimized, leading to a decrease in greenhouse
    gas emissions. Moreover, the adoption of urban farming practices promotes resource
    efficiency, as water and fertilizers can be used more precisely and effectively,
    reducing wastage and environmental pollution. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic
    and climate change have highlighted the importance of developing innovative solutions
    to ensure food security. Urban farming, particularly utilizing greenhouses, presents
    a promising approach [4]. By integrating technologies like WUFARM, which enables
    remote monitoring and control of temperature and humidity, urban farmers can optimize
    crop growth and contribute to local food production. These solutions not only
    address immediate challenges but also contribute to post-pandemic environmental
    sustainability and support the Industry 4.0 revolution. A. Design Monitoring System
    WUFARM utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller. The sensors used to measure temperature
    and humidity values are DHT22. These sensors are activated as inputs to the system,
    while the ESP32 functions as the system processor. The output of this system is
    the measured parameter values displayed on the cloud platform, as well as system
    actions such as fan on/off and irrigation pump. The system block diagram can be
    seen in Figure 1. Fig. 1. Block Diagram of System Show All From Fig 1 we know
    that, the measured parameter values and system actions are displayed on the cloud
    platform, which can be accessed by users through a web interface or mobile application.
    The cloud platform uses the Web of Things (WoT) framework and cloud computing
    technologies to provide a scalable, reliable, and secure environment for storing
    and processing the data Users can monitor the parameter values and system actions
    in real-time, allowing them to track the performance of their urban farming system
    and make adjustments as needed. The output of the WUFARM system is crucial for
    ensuring the success of urban farming initiatives. By providing real-time information
    and enabling automated system actions, the WUFARM system helps users optimize
    their farming practices, improve crop yields, and promote sustainable and efficient
    food production B. Control System Architecture The control system architecture
    consists of a set of Internet of Things (IoT) based components connected to a
    server through the internet. The components of the IoT-based device include sensors,
    microcontrollers, relays, a DC water pump, internet connectivity, and a server.
    There are two sensors, namely the DHT22 sensor and the Capacitive Soil Moisture
    sensor. Sensors are devices designed to detect changes in physical quantities
    such as pressure, force, humidity, temperature, light, and motion. The DHT22 sensor
    is an advanced calibrated digital sensor with the ability to measure two variables,
    namely temperature and humidity [5]. On the other hand, the Capacitive Soil Moisture
    sensor is a resistive sensor with analog output. The Capacitive Soil Moisture
    sensor provides soil moisture values. The microcontroller is used to operate all
    connected components. Furthermore, the relay is used to connect the microcontroller
    and the DC water pump component. The relay is responsible for turning the DC water
    pump on or off. Internet connectivity is used to connect the device to the server.
    The temperature and humidity values generated by the device are sent to the server
    for management on a website [6]. Figure 2 represents the prototype of the control
    system architecture, which aims to demonstrate in a concise and clear manner how
    the Web of Things-based urban farming device works. The prototype of the control
    system architecture explains how the Web of Things-based device operates in the
    design of the prototype Web of Things-based urban farming device. The Web of Things-based
    device will be connected to a server, allowing remote control and monitoring using
    a smartphone or computer through the internet. Fig. 2. Control System Architecture
    Show All C. Hardware Desain The hardware design involves several interconnected
    hardware components within a system. In this design, the ESP32 serves as the microcontroller
    that processes data from the sensors and also functions as the WiFi module used
    to transmit sensor data to ThingSpeak for real-time data display on the ThingSpeak
    website [7]. Sensors such as the DHT22 sensor, Capacitive Soil Moisture sensor,
    and Photosensitive Light Resistance sensor provide input to the ESP32. The relay
    in this design is responsible for commanding the on/off operation of pumps, fans,
    and lights based on the data processed by the ESP32. The LCD is used to display
    the readings from the sensors. Fig. 3. Hardware Schematic Design Show All D. Software
    Design Figure 4 is a flowchart of the program design for the hardware device.
    The initial implementation of the system involves the ESP32 incorporating all
    the required libraries according to the sensor modules used in this program’s
    development. Then, the ESP32 port initialization will be performed. The ESP32
    will read input values from the temperature sensor and humidity sensor. If the
    sensor input values meet the specified standards, there will be condition options
    to perform specific processes, with predefined threshold values for each sensor.
    The ESP32 will connect to the pre-established ThingSpeak channel’s IP address.
    If the channel’s IP address is not connected, the ESP32, which is already connected
    to the internet, will send the read values. The readings from each sensor will
    be sent to the ThingSpeak channel every 15 seconds. The values that have been
    sent to the ThingSpeak channel can be accessed through the built-in ThingSpeak
    web server. Fig. 4. Flowchart System Show All E. WoT as new form of urban agriculture
    Urban Farming Assistance systems have advanced, they have begun to cross paths
    with various other sectors, particularly the technology industry. This intersection
    has facilitated the exploration of new aspects, encompassing automation, the integration
    of software, and hardware incorporating silicon-based components [8]. Such systems
    make use of sensors and actuators to build up a database of information about
    the surrounding environment, eliminating the need for human management [9]–[13].
    F. Future Design To address issues for this prototype, we can consider implementing
    the following solutions: Offline ModeDevelop an offline mode for WUFARM that allows
    it to continue functioning even when it’s not connected to the internet. This
    mode can store data locally and synchronize with the central system once the connection
    is restored. Users can still monitor and control the urban farming system through
    a local network when the internet is unavailable. Cellular Connectivity Integrate
    a cellular modem or SIM card slot into WUFARM. This enables the system to switch
    to cellular data when WiFi is unavailable. Users might need to have a data plan,
    but this can be a reliable backup. Offline or Local Data StorageThe WUFARM system
    can store data locally on the user’s device, such as a smartphone or tablet. This
    data can include sensor readings, irrigation and nutrient delivery schedules,
    and crop selection and planning information. The system can use a local database
    to store this data, which can be synchronized with the central system once the
    internet connection is restored. Alert SystemDevelop a real-time alert system
    that informs users when the WiFi connection is lost or restored. This way, users
    are aware of the situation and can take appropriate actions. SECTION II. Experimental
    Result A. Implementation dan Result The implementation of this prototype can be
    seen in Figure 5. Each sensor is integrated with the ESP32 microcontroller device.
    The testing process for sensor readings is carried out to collect data on plant
    temperature and humidity. The sensors used are the capacitive soil sensor for
    measuring soil moisture and the ESP32 sensor for measuring air temperature and
    humidity. The purpose is to read the results under various conditions. Fig. 5.
    Prototype Internet of Things Show All The prototype of the Web of Things-based
    system is used to detect the environmental conditions of plants, including temperature,
    air humidity, and soil moisture. Monitoring the plant environment can assist in
    urban farming activities carried out by the community, especially in urban areas.
    To detect the plant environment, sensors are used, and the device, through the
    microcontroller, sends data such as temperature, air humidity, and soil moisture
    to the server. This allows the data to be processed, and the device will automatically
    perform actions such as turning on fans and irrigation pumps based on predefined
    rules. Table I the Result of the Sensor Readings From Dht22 Table 1 shows the
    results of the DHT22 sensor testing. The average temperature during the testing
    period was 29.5°C, the average air humidity was 86.4%, and the system performed
    actions according to the specified conditions. The results of the testing from
    the readings of the capacitive soil moisture sensor can be seen in Table II. Table
    II Soil Moisture Sensor Testing Result Table 2 shows the results of the capacitive
    soil moisture sensor testing. The average soil moisture obtained from the testing
    is 69%, and the action that will be taken by the system when the condition meets
    the requirements is that the water pump remains off when the soil is already moist.
    B. Storage of sensor data through Thingspeak To store and manage the sensor data,
    the ThingSpeak platform is utilized. ThingSpeak is an Internet of Things (loT)
    platform that enables the collection, visualization, and analysis of sensor data
    in real-time. It provides an easy-to-use interface for data storage and retrieval,
    making it suitable for our purposes. The sensor data, including temperature, air
    humidity, and soil moisture readings, is sent from the ESP32 microcontroller to
    the ThingSpeak server using Wi-Fi connectivity. The data is then stored in a designated
    channel on ThingSpeak. Each data entry includes a timestamp, allowing for tracking
    and analysis over time. By utilizing ThingSpeak, the collected sensor data can
    be accessed and monitored remotely through a website or mobile application. This
    enables users to stay informed about the environmental conditions of their urban
    farming system and make data-driven decisions regarding irrigation, ventilation,
    and other relevant actions. Overall, the integration of ThingSpeak for sensor
    data storage enhances the functionality and accessibility of the system, providing
    valuable insights for efficient urban farming practices. The results can be viewed
    on the ThingSpeak web channel, as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. Figure 5 displays
    the graph appearance of each temperature measurement data, while Figure 7 displays
    the graph appearance of each air humidity measurement data. C. Visualization using
    Thingspeak Application The ThingSpeak platform not only allows for the storage
    of sensor data but also provides visualization capabilities to effectively analyze
    and interpret the collected data. Through the ThingSpeak application, users can
    create custom visualizations and dashboards to gain insights into the environmental
    conditions of their urban farming system. Using the data stored in the ThingSpeak
    channel, various types of visualizations can be generated, such as line graphs,
    bar charts, or gauges, depending on the nature of the data and the desired representation.
    These visualizations can display real-time or historical data, allowing users
    to track trends and patterns over time. Additionally, the ThingSpeak application
    offers customization options to configure the visualizations according to specific
    requirements. Users can customize the axes, labels, colors, and other parameters
    to enhance the clarity and comprehensibility of the visual representations. By
    visualizing the sensor data through the ThingSpeak application, users can easily
    monitor and interpret the environmental conditions of their urban farming system.
    This visual feedback enables informed decision-making regarding adjustments to
    irrigation, ventilation, and other parameters to optimize plant growth and maximize
    yield. In sumary, the visualizations provided by the ThingSpeak application enhance
    the user’s understanding of the sensor data, facilitating effective monitoring
    and management of the urban farming system. Based on the data obtained from the
    graph results of ThingSpeak, the visualization can also be viewed using the Thing
    View application installed on the researcher’s smartphone, as shown in Figure
    7 and 8. Fig. 6. Grafik Temperature Display Show All Fig. 7. Grafik Humdity Display
    Show All SECTION III. Conclusions and Recommendation The transition towards post-pandemic
    Covid-19 normalization has the potential to disrupt the availability, stability,
    and access to food crops in many countries, including Indonesia. Climate change
    also negatively impacts agricultural productivity and reduces food security. Urban
    farming is an effective solution to minimize the risk of food crises and address
    climate change. This research aims to facilitate urban farming activities by utilizing
    technology. The system will automatically perform planting activities and their
    control. This will assist urban dwellers in maintaining rarely cultivated plants.
    The research employs literature study and prototyping methods, which will aid
    in the design of a Web of Things-based urban farming prototype. The process starts
    from literature study to testing. The monitoring data results are displayed on
    the ThingSpeak website channel and the ThingView application to visualize the
    results on smartphones. The sensor testing yielded an average temperature level
    of 29.38°C, air humidity level of 79,90%, and soil moisture level of 60,67%. Data
    transmission is done in real-time, connected to the internet. This prototype can
    operate according to the designed specifications, ensuring temperature and humidity
    control to support plant growth. Pakchoi (Chinese cabbage) is the plant used for
    this research. The implementation of Web of Things technology, such as the WUFARM
    solution, provides easy access and flexible control in managing temperature and
    humidity inside the greenhouse. However, the design of the prototype should be
    further developed. The data obtained from the Web of Things-based sensor device
    is not yet 100% accurate and needs improvement. The prototype of the Web of Things-based
    urban farming device can be developed into an Artificial Intelligence system that
    can automatically care for plants. Additionally, there is a need to increase awareness
    and education about the importance of urban agriculture and related innovations
    to achieve sustainable food security and reduce negative environmental impacts.
    Furthermore, it is important to support the development of Industry 4.0 by utilizing
    technology in urban agriculture development. In this research, we successfully
    developed a Prototype Urban Farming Assistant (WUFARM) that utilizes the concept
    of the Web of Things (WoT) to enhance family food security. This prototype integrates
    sensor technology and a web platform to monitor and control various aspects of
    urban farming, including irrigation, fertilization, and plant care. Field test
    results indicate that WUFARM significantly improves the efficiency of urban farming
    and reduces crop losses. Furthermore, the use of WoT allows easy access and control
    through mobile devices or computers, providing valuable support to families in
    maintaining their food security. The results of this study offer valuable insights
    into the potential implementation of WoT-based urban farming technology to enhance
    sustainability and family food security in urban environments. Authors Figures

    With around 65% of India directly involved in the agriculture sector, it is the
    backbone of the country’s economy and growth. However, even when the country has
    entered a new era in the twenty-first century, people in India follow most of
    the old and conventional farming methods. Even today, farmers are directly dependent
    on rain irrigation in some parts of the Country. The main reason farmers do not
    know about the health of their plants, and the land’s soil is the lack of knowledge
    and data about the land they are using and the plants they are growing in this
    technologically evolving world. Because of this issue, farmers cannot optimize
    the number of fertilizers, pesticides, water, etc., to provide the plants with
    optimum quality without wasting resources. This optimal use is essential to reduce
    the wastage of resources. In turn, this will be easy on the farmers’ pockets,
    and it will be better for the ecology too. Less water use means farmers do not
    need to spend much money to power their irrigation system. Thus, farmers will
    also buy fewer pesticides and fertilizers. Thus, deploying a pocket-friendly yet
    efficient and easy-to-operate system to automate the farming sector with properly
    structured database management becomes crucial. 2 Literature Review 2.1 Futuristic
    Approach to Agriculture The author showcased a futuristic approach in the smart
    farming sector to perceive environmental data about soil moisture, fertility,
    weather, temperature, rainfall, etc., using numerous sensors. In addition, the
    authors discussed crop and water management, pest control, precision agriculture,
    food production, and its safety. They mentioned various application areas of such
    innovative systems, including Crop Water Management, Precision Agriculture, Integrated
    Pest Management or Control (IPM/C), Food Production Automation, Green House Automation,
    and Other Projects Implemented to Date [1]. Wireless sensor nodes can be interconnected
    and connected to a gateway node. This gateway node is connected to the Internet,
    which shall transfer data from the sensor nodes to the database and server. The
    server then relays the data to the user at a remote location through a front-end
    user interface (U.I.) [2]. 2.2 Moisture and Water Level Sensors with Arduino Ritika
    et al., in their paper titled “A Research Paper on Smart Agriculture Using IoT,”
    explained the system in which temperature and soil of moisture, level of water,
    etc., on the farm. The sensor nodes here are controlled by the Arduino Uno microcontroller,
    which works with Atmel’s ATMega328P-PU [3]. The most crucial factor in farming
    is the water source. It is also necessary for agriculture and key to our sustainable
    quality of life. The water crisis is knocking at the doorstep of humankind. Therefore,
    keeping track of the water sources is very important nowadays [4, 5]. 2.3 Sensor
    Nodes with IoT Network In the paper titled “An IoT Based Smart Irrigation System”
    in May 2017, Priyadharsnee and Rathi discussed connecting sensor nodes with IoT
    systems to support the farms for automated irrigation facilities. Decision-making
    is done through a microcontroller [6]. The system was divided into three main
    modules. Parameter sensing module is responsible for sensing the parameters like
    temperature, soil moisture, and electrical conductivity, which are taken from
    sensors placed in soil used for cultivation. Analysis and decision-making has
    the threshold for all the parameters determined and programmed beforehand. This
    needs to be done before we start collecting the analog and digital data from the
    sensors [7]. User acknowledgement is essential for enabling farms or users to
    know about the complete state of their field and cultivation, especially for the
    farmers dependent on manual labor to cultivate the land [8]. 2.4 Lightweight MQTT
    Protocol and Worldwide Connectivity In 2019, Naman and Medhavi published paper
    titled “Home Automation with NoSQL and Node-RED through Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport.” They replaced the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. MQTT protocol has smaller digital
    footprint and smaller size of packet with less header which results in higher
    speed to transmission of data. This also enabled the system to work on lesser
    bandwidth and inconsistent connection especially in rural areas [9]. This system
    had a worldwide connectivity over any wired or wireless Internet, even on the
    mobile devices through a client. The system had a cloud database so it had a global
    connectivity and the home hub were individually connected with a broker on the
    local server. The local server has a connectivity with the cloud database. 3 Shortcomings
    of the Existing Systems Local Reach and Connectivity. Several previous systems
    used to work on the local on-premise basis only. As a result, they do not have
    connectivity to the global system, which only restricts the farmers to local observability.
    Bandwidth Limitations and Heavy Internet Protocols. Primarily, all the previous
    systems were using Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for data transmission,
    which requires a larger bandwidth due to its larger packet size. So, the HTTP
    system may show latencies and even failure in some cases due to lower bandwidth
    in remote areas, especially in India, where fast Internet is still an issue. Dependence
    on Centralized On-Premise Unit and Problem with Scaling. The previous systems
    worked as a single unit. However, scaling the system for a large-scale agro-industry
    is a very tedious task to handle with such a system. In addition, more sensing
    nodes will require additional infrastructure to handle many nodes. Therefore,
    a system with independent nodes must connect with the database directly without
    any on-premise central unit. 4 The Architecture of the Proposed System The system
    is divided into entities—sensor node and Internet backbone. Users can control
    the irrigation system from the dashboard after analysis of soil and ambient data.
    Refer to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Architecture of the system Full size image 4.1 The Architecture
    of the System It consists of an ESP8266 microcontroller powered by a 5 V. A capacitive
    soil moisture sensor is attached to the A0 pin of the ESP8266 as the sensor gives
    analog outputs only. To perceive the ambient temperature and humidity, a DHT11
    sensor is attached to the General Purpose Input–Output (GPIO) pin 0. Also, a waterproof
    soil temperature sensor is used to record soil temperature using the DS18B20 Water
    Proof Temperature Probe, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Schematic of the sensor nodes
    Full size image 4.2 Cloud Server As shown in Fig. 2, the data sent from the sensor
    nodes to the server is handled directly. The server handles the reception of all
    the REST-API requests. It is connected to the database on one side and the dashboard
    on the other. The database has tables for each feed having a unique feed ID and
    stored data according to those feed Ids. The server responds to the APIs and handles
    them per the type of request. If there is a data request, the server takes the
    feed ID and searches the table to match the corresponding feed ID. It then copies
    the latest data from the table and creates a JSON response. This is then sent
    back to the sensor node. If the API request is in the update mode, the server
    reads the feed ID and creates a new row in the table of the corresponding feed
    ID. Also, the dashboard component subscribed to the feed ID is updated by the
    broker on the server. If the user changes some data on the dashboard using the
    component, it gets updated by the broker using the MQTT protocol in the database
    table of the corresponding feed ID. 5 Working of the System 5.1 Establishing a
    Wireless Connection As ESP8266 can be set in two modes, the sensor node is set
    in STA mode to connect as a client to the Wi-Fi. The sensor node connects with
    the AP using SSID and password fed during the program upload. When the sensor
    node can connect to the hotspot network (access point) with the correct password,
    the system only goes for further steps. This way, the correct and authentic sensor
    nodes programmed with the correct SSID and password get connected. 5.2 Perception
    of Data from the Environment and Processing by the Microcontroller As shown in
    Fig. 3, the program flow starts when each sensor takes the data from the microcontroller.
    The soil moisture, temperature, and DHT11 sensor send their data to the microcontroller.
    Unlike all other sensors sending a digital value, the soil moisture sensor sends
    analog signals to the ESP8266. This data is stored temporarily before sending
    it to the feeds. Each feed on the cloud server has a specific feed ID to identify
    each feed from the other uniquely. Thus, a feed pointer must be initialized with
    a unique feed ID which could point to the feed on the IoT database based in the
    cloud. Fig. 3 Data perception and sending to the cloud IO feeds Full size image
    5.3 Time-Sensitive Transmission of Data This system needs to be secure and time-sensitive
    because all the data shall be shown to the remote user or the farmers in real
    time. First transfer mode is authorized by using an API key to uniquely identify
    the actual device. REST-APIs are very lightweight and easily understandable by
    humans and machines. The REST-API for reading data from the database takes parameters,
    including the secret API key and feed ID of the feed you need to fetch data from.
    The API sends a JSON response to this request made to the server. The second way
    to send and receive data is by using the MQTT. It is a protocol for light data
    transmission on very low bandwidth with a small digital footprint. Each feed on
    the database has a feed ID to which it has subscribed. When the sensor node publishes
    some data to the specific feed ID, the feed subscribed to the feed ID reads that
    data and stores the value, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Handling data from sensor
    nodes and updating dashboard Full size image 6 Conclusion The system could perceive
    the data about the farm’s surroundings and the soil’s health, like temperature
    and moisture, within 10 s and efficiently relay it to the cloud server via the
    Internet (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 IoT dashboard with all the parameters within the limits
    Full size image Despite being running on the battery, this device consumes significantly
    less battery as the ESP8266 microcontroller is very power efficient. Thus, these
    systems are very suitable for deployment in rural areas. The dashboard of the
    IoT cloud is very intuitive and accessible. The components keep updating themselves
    as soon as new data is updated into the database tables. WSN can be improved with
    intra-node communication between the different sensor nodes. The system depends
    on Wi-Fi access points for data transmission. This can be improved by using a
    communication technique suitable for rural areas where the Internet is not available
    easily. GSM can be used for data communication via cellular reception to send
    SMS acknowledgement to the farmers. References Welbourne, E., Battle, L., Cole,

    Location: Noida, India Introduction The economy of India is based primarily on
    agriculture. About 65% of labour force is employed by it, and it accounts for
    more than 20% of the GDP [9]. India offers a vast variety of agricultural products
    due to its unique agro-climatic zone. India, meanwhile, has a huge agricultural
    potential but has been dealing with an agrarian problem for decades. Due to an
    over-reliance on monsoon rains for irrigation and a lack of modernization in farming
    practises, the state of agriculture in India has not much improved as expected.
    The development of intelligent irrigation systems based on dynamic parameter prediction
    using the Internet of Things and other technologies is crucial for the efficient
    and optimum use of fresh water in irrigation. The Internet of Things (IoT) is
    a technology that enables human-machine interaction and allows for the measurement
    of a machine’s capacity and capabilities by a variety of devices [10]. It often
    consists of networks made up of sensors and equipment that are deployed in different
    geographic locations according to the task chosen. It is a set of networks that
    are used to collect data from sensors that are connected to web servers so that
    users around the world can access the data. A framework is created in IoT-based
    agriculture system to monitor the field using sensors for light, temperature,
    soil moisture, and other factors. The user can keep an eye on the situation on
    the field from anywhere. Contrasted with the conservative approach, IoT-based
    smart farming is significantly more productive. The technique can be used to increase
    profitability by utilising compost, pesticides, water, and other resources. The
    constant ecological factors, such as soil moisture content and temperature, have
    an unceasing effect on harvest enhancement [11]. Monitoring the effective use
    of water in agricultural areas is possible with the right sensor placement. Using
    intelligent irrigation devices, outdoor water savings are possible. Smart irrigation
    controllers and sensors have been developed in order to reduce outdoor water usage
    by irrigation based on plant water requirements, as opposed to conventional automatic
    system timers, which irrigate according to a user-determined set schedule [12].
    This technology can be used to construct a smart controller by attaching a sensor
    to an existing irrigation timer or as a whole system on its own. These products
    increase the effectiveness of irrigation by minimising water waste while preserving
    plant health and quality. Utilizing smart irrigation technology in the landscape
    may help to cut back on water usage outside. Both modest, private landscapes and
    huge, professionally managed landscapes can benefit from this technology. The
    agriculture sector has been facing the issue of low and inefficient water supply
    for a long time, so it is necessary to bring a system for better management and
    utilization of the resources present for increased productivity. The research
    started by reviewing the already done research in this particular area. After
    that, the sensors for the system were decided. The reason for choosing the sensors
    was that some of the major factors influencing the crop are moisture, humidity
    and temperature. Another major factor which helps the crop from rotting is a proximity
    sensor which detects intrusive objects and informs the user about them. An architecture
    was created for the system to work upon and it was linked to the Blynk server
    to get the information from the plant in real-time. The organisation of this work
    is as follows: In Literature Review we see the related work done on the same and
    their contribution followed by The Proposed System that works on the flow of first
    checking for the surrounding temperature and humidity, next it checks for the
    soil moisture. Now, if the value of the moisture level of soil is less and the
    weather conditions are also dry, in that case the area can be watered and an alert
    for the same will be sent to the user via the blynk mobile application. The article
    is also briefed with the hardware and technologies used to build the setup and
    their advantages. Lastly we come to The Result Analysis and Conclusion of the
    work carried out in this paper. Fig. 1. Work Flow of the Proposed System Show
    All Literature Review Disha et al. made a suggestion on how to effectively manage,
    reduce, and increase water consumption efficiency [1]. Using the Blynk application,
    the individual will be allowed to monitor field factors like temperature and moisture.
    The solution that is suggested makes use of soil moisture sensors and DHT-11 sensors.
    This paper helped in understanding the utility of the sensors in a real world
    scenario and how we can inculcate the same in our research. Induction Motor Protection
    System and Data Monitoring Over IoT Blynk [2]. Use of automated or manual control
    methods to start and stop an induction motor’s activity to avoid system faults.
    Electromechanical actuators with built-in sensors for remotely monitoring motor
    system characteristics are the most widely used fault detection approach. Under
    some conditions, the motor works as a form of defence. The motor’s excursions
    also point to a cost-effective solution to induction motor difficulties. Blynk’s
    functionality was inculcated through this research. How the data is taken from
    the sensors and sent to the cloud in real time is shown in this research. The
    goal of the IoT-based monitoring system for epileptic patients [3] is to monitor
    epileptic illness signs, Behavior signals in humans and early disease prevention.
    The fuzzy logic technique used to evaluate the required data set of ill patients’
    parameters permits categorization into several forms of convulsions such as heart
    rate, body temperature, muscular spasms, and collapses. A prototype of an epileptic
    monitoring system had been effectively created and tested. This project helped
    in understanding how the data received from the sensors can be visualised and
    the results can be analyzed. The second instance of Ipswich city-Australian council
    has shown that utilising an intelligent soil-moisture surveillance system [4]
    as a controller of irrigation leads to considerable water conservation as well
    as cost reductions. In compared to a rainfall-based allocation technique, the
    automatically generated web-based solution has proven to be more efficient. The
    strategy used by the council not only improves performance but also allows for
    less soil expertise and less labour required to manage the irrigation system.
    Furthermore, the adoption has decreased water use and waste, allowing for resource
    conservation while producing higher-quality products overall. This research is
    quite closely related to the one being worked upon in this paper. The influence
    of the monitoring in deciding the time and level of hydration of soil is really
    a helpful feature in maintaining the plant health. The overuse of fertilisers
    has a negative impact on soil productivity. Farooq et al. [5] conducted a survey
    of 67 research papers papers published between 2006 and 2019 concerning the use
    of IoT in various agricultural applications; they discovered that approximately
    16% of the research papers in study were on precision farming, 12% on surrounding
    temperature, 13% on soil observing, 11% on humidity tracking, 5% on air and diseases
    monitoring, 11% on animal monitoring, and 7% on water controlling. Furthermore,
    roughly 4% of the study publications focused on fertilisation management. This
    research helped us in getting a broad look on the level of work being done in
    the field of agriculture and plants in academic area and how this paper can help
    in contributing to improve it. [6] describe the concept of a dynamic irrigation
    scheduling system (AgriSens) based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for optimal
    water administration of irrigated agriculture areas. Using IoT, the AgriSens delivers
    real-time, automated, adaptive, and remote manual irrigation treatment for various
    phases of growth of a crop’s product lifecycle. The AgriSens boosts field output
    by at best 10.21% over the old manual irrigation approach, doubles the lifespan
    of the network, and achieves 94% dependability yet after 500 hours of service.
    The research in this paper adds significant improvements to this research by adding
    in another factor that can help in improving the lifespan of the plant and less
    dependability on resources. Monitoring blood pressure while at home necessitates
    an accurate, low-cost approach that is devoid of user mobility. Ramakrishnan et
    al. [7] created a Portable Health Monitoring Device utilising the Internet of
    Things (BLYNK APP), a system that monitors and detects Human Heartbeat, SpO2 and
    delivers the output to the user or server end that use a microcontroller at a
    low expense and high efficacy. The data that is stored in the cloud-configured
    JAVA server will be presented for subsequent examination by physicians. Similiar
    to [2], this research helped in gaining insights on collecting data from Blynk
    to help in the analysis of the results. The ESP8266 WiFiModule, that manages various
    activities and provides vital data on several parameters with respect to the plants
    under observation through wireless networking over a digital system, was used
    by Badri et al. to build a prototype that can deliver an effective system for
    making decisions [8]. They utilised a water pump, an ESP8266, an Infrared sensor,
    a relay module, a soil moisture sensor, Blynk, and the Arduino IDE. Proposed structure
    An IoT based water system plans to make use of the implanted framework to make
    monitoring of planted areas easy. Having sensors linked with the controller, the
    framework measures the moisture, temperature etc. of soil and subsequently the
    detected information is prepared within the controller and sent to the user’s
    device via blynk cloud. A. Hardware used NodeMCU ESP8266:: The NodeMCU ESP8266
    is a Wi-Fi Silicon chip-set based micro controller. It has a 128KB memory and
    a storage size of 4megabytes, and is powered by a USB cable. Fig. 2. NodeMCU ESP8266
    Circuit Board Show All Temperature Sensor:: The DHT11 temperature sensor is easily
    available in online stores and will keep a check on soil temperature. It will
    give timely readings and updates to the user about soil temperature and whether
    it is affecting the moisture content of the soil. Fig. 3. Temperature Sensor Show
    All Moisture Sensor:: A soil moisture testing sensor keeps a check on the moisture
    content of the soil and alerts the user to start or stop the irrigation. Moisture
    plays an important role when it comes to the development of a crop as it is one
    of the three major factors responsible for crop growth. Fig. 4. Moisture Sensor
    Show All Proximity Sensor:: Proximity sensor are used to detect objects approaching
    near. There are different types of proximity sensors available like optical, capacitive,
    ultrasonic, inductive and magnetic. We used an optical proximity sensor which
    works on Infrared Red(IR) sensory modules for our use case. Fig. 5. Proximity
    Sensor Show All B. Circuit Architecture Fig. 6. Circuit Diagram of the Proposed
    System Show All A test system was created based on the simulated image shown in
    Fig. 6 and the microcontroller was coded to run and receive an output directly
    in the computer. It was then tested on the plants in a controlled environment.
    Once the test setup was complete. The next step was taken to create such a system
    that would run the monitoring system in a way that it would not require a computer
    to be attached to it for it to run and provide an output. For this, the Blynk’s
    Cloud platform was used. Blynk is an online open-source platform for Internet
    of Things devices. It provides an interface that helps in remotely controlling
    the devices with the help of the internet. It also creates interactive dashboards
    that help in visualizing the data and keep an eye on the system without being
    near it. It mainly consists of three modules: Blynk Server: This is responsible
    for the communication of the device with the smartphone over the internet and
    has the bandwidth of supporting thousands of IOT devices including Raspberry Pi.
    You can run it privately or using a public blynk server Blynk App: This provides
    various interfaces for you to interact with your system and control and monitor
    it remotely Blynk Libraries: These are the libraries responsible for enabling
    communication to and from the device and receive input and output commands. C.
    Advantages Light-Weight, simple and efficient : The sensors used for this mechanism
    are not only fast, but they are also pocket-sized, they are efficient, being pocket-sized,
    they are lightweight as well. Since the sensors used are specific to one domain,
    it being either temperature or moisture, they are often proven to be very efficient
    in their manner of working. Regulates and conserves water: The biggest advantage
    of IoT based Smart Irrigation System is the amount of water it saves because it
    knows exactly how much moisture the soil and the crop needs and regulates the
    water flow accordingly. It saves up to 50% of the total water consumption. Not
    only that but because of the regulation of water flow, the risk of over-perspiration
    in the soil which may lead to crop damage also reduces exponentially. Low maintenance
    and affordable: Having an IoT based smart irrigation system might sound expensive
    to set up and have high maintenance costs, but the sensors are quite cheap and
    they also do not require much maintenance as well. Because of this, it is actually
    quite helpful for farmers of smaller scale as well. The user is always up-to-date
    with field conditions : Being an IoT based system, another perk is the real-time
    field conditions like temperature check and moisture check you get on your mobile
    device without even being in the field. You can be anywhere in the world if you
    have an internet connection and the sensors in the field are connected via a network,
    you can check on your field conditions and increase or decrease the water level
    being released in the field. Once the devices were set up with the code that included
    the data from the blynk libraries and secured with the authentication key. The
    devices were using WiFi to access the internet. They were powered by the standard
    5W power adapter and a micro-USB type cable. After doing a test run for a few
    hours, the system was deployed in two environments. One System was left in an
    unmonitored environment in an empty room with indirect sunlight and watered infrequently.
    Another system was put in a monitored environment where it received timely watering
    and also received ample sunlight. The data extraction was done for 1 week in both
    the environments to find out the trends in the following parameters: Moisture
    Humidity Temperature Proximity Result analysis The data has been collected for
    a duration of a week to properly understand the behavior and nature of the plant.
    The data is depicted via graphs as shown below: Moisture As shown in Figure 7,
    the plant in the monitored environment shows a consistently higher moisture level
    when compared to the one in the unmonitored environment. The inconsistency of
    readings from the unmonitored environment can be seen in the sudden rise and fall
    of the moisture content of the plant. Fig. 7. Moisture Reading Show All Fig. 8.
    Humidity Reading Show All Humidity Just like the moisture levels mentioned above,
    It can be seen in Figure 8 that the consistency of lower humidity levels as a
    result of constant watering of the plants can be seen by the plant of the monitored
    environment. The lower watering in the unmonitored environment denotes the higher
    humidity levels in the plant. Temperature Fig. 9. Temperature Reading Show All
    Figure 9 depicts the constant rise of the temperature in the monitored environment
    due to external sources and it being consistent due to the timely watering and
    care of the plant while the plant present in the unmonitored environment shows
    constant drops and rise of the temperature due to internal factors of the plant
    such as low moisture higher humidity and such. Proximity Fig. 10. Proximity Reading
    Show All Figure 10 shows how the plant which was monitored showed less intervention
    by rodents and external interference while the unmonitored system faced uneven
    patterns and polar opposite results in the proximity readings. Conclusion The
    goal of this research was to develop a system that monitors the moisture, temperature
    and humidity of the field and also keeps a check on any interference by rodents,
    insects or any livestock in the field. The entire system has been created and
    deployed on a pilot scale, and it wirelessly collects sensor node data over the
    cloud using web services, while a both web and mobile based information visualization
    and decision support system offers real-time insights based on the analysis of
    the sensor. This system sends the data collected by the sensors to the end user
    or the server using the micro-controller with very reasonable cost. The values
    that are collected by the micro-controller are sent via the cloud service Blynk.
    Apart from the above benefits it also includes the functionality of storing the
    data which can be retrieved at any point for further analysis. Two environments
    were observed for this research, one depicting a controlled environment and another
    depicting an uncontrolled and unmonitored environment. The data collected from
    Blynk was visualized using graphs to analyze the differences that occurred due
    to the environment in which the plant was kept in. Our proposed system is easy
    to use, economical, and updates in real time and through our system, we were able
    to reach the conclusion that the plant present in a monitored environment can
    sustain longer with fewer intervention from rodents and lesser utilization of
    resources. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Reports Versions Notes Abstract Automation is being fueled by a multifaceted approach
    to technological advancements, which includes advances in artificial intelligence,
    robotics, sensors, and cloud computing. The use of automated, as opposed to conventional,
    systems, has become more popular in recent years. Modern agricultural technology
    has played an important role in the development of Saudi Arabia in addition to
    upgrading infrastructure and plans. Agriculture in Saudi Arabia is dependent upon
    wells, which are insufficient in terms of water supplies. Thus, irrigation is
    used for agricultural fields, depending on the soil type, and water is provided
    to the plants. Two essential elements are necessary for farming, the first is
    the ability to determine the soil’s fertility, and the second is the use of different
    technologies to reduce the dependence of water on electrical power and on/off
    schedules. The purpose of this study is to propose a system in which moisture
    sensors are placed under trees or plants. The gateway unit transmits sensor information
    to the controller, which then turns on the pump and recycles the water flow. A
    farmland’s water pump can be remotely controlled and parameters such as moisture
    and flow rate can be monitored using an HTTP dashboard. In order to evaluate the
    applicability of IOT-based automatic wastewater irrigation systems, a pilot test
    was conducted using the developed framework. Theoretically, such a system could
    be expanded by including any pre-defined selection parameters. Keywords: sensors;
    microcontroller; mobile networking; data processing; visualizations; Internet
    of Thing (IoT); GUI 1. Introduction The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations
    and Saudi Arabia are already classified as water-scarce countries, with only Oman
    above the extreme scarcity threshold of 500 cubic meters per capita per year [1].
    The growth of agricultural production is greatly affected by climate change, urban
    population concentration, crop diseases, and greenhouse emissions, all of which
    highlight the need to meet the growing demand for food and energy. With water
    resources already scarce, the Middle East and North Africa regions will be particularly
    vulnerable to climate change [2]. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest arid countries
    without permanent rivers or lakes in the Arabian Peninsula [3,4]. In some parts
    of the region, temperatures can reach more than 50° Celsius (C) (122° Fahrenheit
    (F)), resulting in extremely hot and dry conditions. The country has one of the
    poorest natural renewable water resources [5]. Renewable natural resources can
    be affected by a range of variables, including water demand in different sectors
    and the effects of global warming. There is a recurring theme in research papers
    on water resources and agriculture related to climate change. Because of global
    warming, water adaptation measures have been considered to ensure food production
    and people’s access to water, and the preservation of ecosystems. Further, the
    worsening drought conditions in the peninsular countries have created a need for
    increasing the water supply from alternative sources and the implementation of
    water conservation. Moreover, humans and the environment should be assured of
    their safety as a result of water scarcity or water quality and supply in the
    face of intensifying climate-related impacts. There are various risks associated
    with climate change, including water shortages, water quality reductions, soil
    salinity increases, biodiversity loss, irrigation requirements, and the cost of
    emergency and remedial action to make sure that farmers plant a crop with a guarantee
    of success and generating income. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water
    in Saudi Arabia, amounting to up the 70% of the total water use, creating a demand
    for optimization strategies. The number of studies focusing on reducing irrigation
    water consumption has increased because of the introduction of smart water management.
    In addition to social, economic, and climate change policies, technological innovations
    can improve water management, according to some studies [6]. Because of the ever-increasing
    demand for food necessities and the diminishing supply of those necessities, there
    is always room for improvement in the production of agricultural produce through
    the adoption of an agro-tech-based system. Only through cultivation can such things
    be provided. There is no doubt that this is an imperative factor in human societies
    when it comes to increasing and maintaining the demand for food production. However,
    the scarcity of land and water has resulted in a decreasing volume of water available
    on farms. Therefore, farmers are using irrigation to supplement their water supply
    system through using high-tech-based systems. It is possible to define irrigation
    as the science of artificially applying water to land or soil. The methods unfolding
    in the agriculture sector are related to what is termed precision agriculture
    capable of estimating the chemistry of the soil to determine the water needs to
    raise a given crop for productive yield. This means that plants are to be provided
    with water according to the type of soil to be irrigated. The virgin fertility
    of the soil is also being investigated using sensor technology. This is in conjunction
    with the collection and study of the characteristics of the soil moisture dynamics
    profile. The purpose is to use this data as feedback to improve farming efficiency
    [7]. The use of renewable energy-powered technology in Seawater Reverse Osmosis
    (SWRO) desalination plants has had an impact on the preparation for embracing
    Industry 4.0 in every sector with promising results benefitting humans and agriculture
    [8,9]. An IoT-enabled framework for automated farming is essentially a network
    consisting of sensory electronics installed and distributed on the farm at specific
    locations and connected through a bi-directional communication channel with the
    management center equipped with related hardware devices harnessed through purposefully
    developed programming modules. This kind of agriculture is growing in quality,
    sustainability, transparency, and cost-effectiveness to maximize crop production
    with lower labor costs. Herein, we propose a system that uses WSN to retrieve
    environmental data in real time in order to optimize irrigation timing implementation.
    The rest of the paper consists of a discussion of related work in Section 2, and
    an outline of the intelligent communication system in Section 3, the monitoring
    flowchart in Section 4, Data collection in Section 5, with design dashboard in
    Section 6, while implementation of test scenarios for real-time implementation
    are described in Section 7, the results and discussion in Section 8, and conclusions
    and further work are given in Section 9. 2. Related Work The Kingdom of Saudi
    Arabia, with a total area of 2.25 million km2, is a large country, bordered by
    Jordon and Iraq and Kuwait in the north, on the east by the Gulf, Bahrain and
    the United Arab Emirates, on the south by the Sultanate of Oman and Yemen, and
    in the west by the Red Sea, giving it a coastline of 1750 km. Saudi Arabia is
    on its way to achieving self-sufficiency in poultry and dairy products [10,11].
    Automatic farming systems are based on the collection of data related to soil
    moisture content, the temperature profile of an indoor covered agriculture farm
    shed, rainfall data, and intra-field wind speed profiles [12,13]. The related
    data archives are stored in a computer server that is capable of providing climate
    prediction, soil condition analysis, and disturbance analysis [14,15]. A fuzzy
    controller was used by Jamroen et al. to adjust irrigation taking into account
    the moisture index and water stress [16] by continuously monitoring the soil moisture
    content and crop water variability. Lloret et al. have used flooding methods to
    carry out irrigation automatically by observing remotely crop variables and climatic
    conditions using an application [17] that allows the farmer to remotely control
    water gates in the water canals. Based on the difference in environmental leaf
    temperatures and light intensity in hydroponic crops under temperature control
    between 28 and 32 degrees Celsius, Puengsungwan et al. propose a method for determining
    root stress in soilless cultivation. According to their proposal, the obtained
    patterns are divided into regions representing natural roots, stress roots, and
    rotten roots. Using IoT technologies, they were able to reduce the system’s response
    time from 5 min to less than 60 s. In addition, they increased detection efficiency
    from 85% to 95% compared to a method that uses the Easy Leaf Area application
    to determine the drop in leaf area [18]. A variety of irrigation systems have
    been used in soil and soilless crops. Different approaches exist to estimate irrigation
    requirements in soil cultivation, highlighting the importance of monitoring and
    controlling the temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and water stress
    index used for operating micro-sprinklers, drip irrigation, and ventilation fans.
    Several authors, including González-Amarillo [19] and Fernández-Ahumada [20],
    use humidity or temperature measurements to properly maintain conditions within
    an agricultural shed by turning on all related irrigation, ventilation, and heating
    systems. By measuring daily evapotranspiration, Mohamed [21] and Poyen [22] estimate
    irrigation requirements. Mohamed employs the Penman–Monteith method, whereas Poyen
    includes the capability of automatically selecting between Hargreaves and Samni,
    Kharufa, and Penman–Monteith methods according to the type of climate and geographical
    factors by employing modern technologies and intelligent systems for improving
    water productivity and conservation. These are some examples (among many others)
    of how the word \"smart\" is used in works and prototypes that show different
    capabilities and features. In an effort to solve the problem of one-size-fits-all
    qualification, the research community has proposed different taxonomies that classify
    smart artifacts based on their features [23]. Bin Ahmadon et. al. consists of
    two major phases in their paper. Phase one is design, and phase two is implementation.
    Here are the scenarios for two major phases in which a service must be implemented
    in a different [24]. Agro-IoT was an agricultural IoT project that ran from 2015
    to 2020 and featured an architecture that consists of six layers, including sensors,
    actuators, wireless nodes, etc. In addition, there is a network layer that includes
    communication protocols, an intermediate layer for software, an application layer
    for data analysis and prediction, and a user layer where results are communicated
    to farmers, experts in the field, and the supply chain. Among the goals of the
    project were real-time monitoring of low-scale greenhouses, early disease detection,
    identification of crop varieties, optimizing irrigation facilities, and pesticide
    use and fertilizers efficiency. Similarly, solar precision agriculture is seen
    as a four-layer IoT architecture, consisting of the sensory layer, the network
    layer that takes into account IoT nodes and base stations, the decision layer
    that involves server services, workstations, business and knowledge bases, and
    the application availability layer that provides information for researchers,
    experts, and farmers [25,26]. The implemented irrigation solution developed in
    this research is not restricted to the control of irrigation systems. It also
    analyzes every component of the system, from water pipes to sprinklers, to detect
    leaks and malfunctions, while improving efficiency and reducing costs. The proposed
    solution uses Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to collect real-time information
    data directly in the field to verify the existing conditions. By combining this
    information with weather forecasts, evapotranspiration from soil and other surfaces
    and plants, and farm specifications, artificial intelligence algorithms are able
    to determine how much water is needed for a particular section of the farm by
    adjusting the irrigation controller accordingly. 3. Intelligent Communication
    Systems As shown in Figure 1, the IoT-based irrigation system consists of six
    main elements: Data Acquisition, Data Monitoring, Communication, Data Processing,
    Storage, and Visualization. Figure 1. Block diagram of the IoT-based irrigation
    system. 3.1. Data Acquisition An array of sensors must be used to obtain data
    from soil moisture sensors, rainfall sensors, ambient humidity sensors, and temperature
    sensors, among other devices. The various sensors used to monitor crops are configured
    with a variety of threshold values. This corresponds to the type of crop being
    monitored and depends on the type of sensor. Since the sensors sense and acquire
    data at intervals, the measurements will be sent through Wi-Fi modules to be processed
    according to the parameters of each of the measurements. 3.2. Data Monitoring
    A supervisory system is required to manage and monitor the information gathered
    by the sensors (temperature, rainfall, and moisture), as well as on crops and
    their cycles. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to display the information
    that is stored in the database. A statistical analysis of the amount of water
    consumed by crops with respect to their dates and sections has been carried out
    as a result of monitoring. Finally, all data are requested through the use of
    web services, which are made available on the Internet for access by authorized
    personnel. 3.3. Communication Networking The sensors are connected to Arduino
    microcontroller development boards that use ESP8266 Wi-Fi modules to communicate
    with the database, and everything is done via the cloud since the entire solution
    relies on the cloud for connectivity. The database is not directly connected to
    the sensor because it is not secure. Data is entered into the database using a
    Web Service (WS). The Wi-Fi module transmits two fields: (1) the identification
    number (ID), and (2) the value of the sensor. Each type of sensor is assigned
    a unique ID based on its IP address and a unique number. As an identifier, it
    serves the purpose of identifying the source of information. The data is processed
    to determine if irrigation is required. The watering schedule is updated when
    it is determined that watering is necessary based on the interpretation of the
    information. An electronic valve is incorporated into the irrigation system and
    is controlled by the Arduino via the Wi-Fi module. Since the Wi-Fi Module does
    not have a public IP address, it cannot be identified from the cloud, and therefore
    requests cannot be sent from the cloud to the module. In the same manner, the
    Wi-Fi module continuously queries the web service for information. The valve is
    activated in response to an update in the WS with the time the system was powered
    on. The Wi-Fi module is assigned a static IP address whenever it is connected
    to an Internet gateway, making it easier to access from the Internet. In order
    to monitor data in a timely manner, data visualization along with database information
    is required. A web application for data visualization has been used in this case
    study, but other methods may also be employed. Previous projects used the data
    collected in order to increase the productivity of the garden or farm, as well
    as to reduce the amount of water used. Although these ideas are useful in theory,
    they may not be able to be implemented in a practical scenario. In our system,
    the algorithm enables the system to understand how much water should be applied
    to the field based on the moisture in the field; however, the field is watered
    only when moisture levels are low. Using this approach, we were able to save approximately
    25% of our budget. Despite this, our previous systems lack a certain level of
    reliability, which can be attributed mainly to the selected sensors. In addition,
    they need to be tested in a larger scenario. In order to improve results and to
    make sure that the solution works in multiple environments, the wireless network
    will play a crucial role in ensuring its effectiveness. 3.4. Data Processing Soil
    moisture, temperature, and rainfall are received as sensor data in the form of
    three integer values. Decisions regarding the crop can be made based on the information
    provided by this data. It is necessary to note that the valve will only open if
    the soil moisture is below the level required for the crop. In the case of sprinkler
    irrigation, the water temperature will determine whether irrigation is required.
    The system will not permit the watering of the plants in the event of rain. The
    valve can either be opened or no action taken depending on the values collected
    by the sensors. 3.5. Storage Databases are necessary to store information about
    crop types, sensors, moisture, and statistical data. The database used in the
    application is schematically as shown in Figure 2. The purpose of this structure
    is to store information about crops, their cycles, and the order in which each
    irrigation should be performed. Furthermore, information about the monitored sections
    is saved, as well as that of the sensors associated with each section. The system
    uses the IoT to determine the amount of water needed for every crop in every cycle
    using a “smart irrigation” system. Instead of creating another smart irrigation
    controller, in this work, we have created a smart sustainable irrigation solution.
    This solution also analyzes every component of the system, from the pipes that
    supply the water to the sprinklers. This is because it analyzes their interaction.
    During this analysis, the aim is to detect potential leaks or malfunctions, improve
    efficiency and reduce costs in a sustainable way in line with the requirements
    of a circular economy. Figure 2. Flowchart of the IoT-based irrigation system.
    3.6. Visualization The administrator will be able to control the variables (sensor
    data), as well as irrigate the crop in order to ensure that the resulting data
    are presented in an appropriate manner. There are different irrigation configurations
    for each type of crop when it comes to visualization and interaction with users.
    When this is not possible, the possibility of adjusting the configuration of crops
    is available based on a predetermined composition. 4. Flowchart Initially, the
    user interacts with the irrigation system using a mobile application or any other
    connected interface to extract data regarding the current soil conditions and
    moisture in order to change the state of the irrigation system. The sensor node/mote
    measures the soil moisture, temperature, and humidity of the surrounding environment
    of—in this case of this study—each date palm tree. The information can be received
    using an automated system as shown in Figure 2. Users can make a decision with
    respect to watering based on the data available/provided on the application or
    system. The method will lead to accurate agricultural techniques to closely monitor
    the conditions of the field and use real-time data to realize the most efficient
    irrigation. 5. Data Collection and Connection All sensor nodes have been installed
    and are connected to the network master node. The node will send information packets
    to every sensor hub bearing the sensor hub ID if communication is present in the
    node. After acquiring the data packets from the sensors, the measured values of
    soil parameters are analyzed—for example: Soil moisture assessment (30%). A pH
    value is used to determine whether the soil is acidic or alkaline. The sensors
    assess the quality of the equipment, and these quality values are stored in the
    memory of the Arduino microcontroller unit (MCU). In response to these stored
    values, the MCU responds by performing specific actions according to the listed
    conditions. When data packets are received from the sensor node, the MCU transmits
    them wirelessly to the master node, thereby participating in the Internet of Things
    (IoT) environment activities. 6. Designed Monitoring Dashboard The dashboard can
    be thought of as a server that can be designed using a mobile device, as shown
    in Figure 3. Using the dashboard, the user will be able to monitor the amount
    of water flow, and parameters such as temperature and humidity. In addition, users
    are also able to turn on/off the water pump just by operating the monitoring dashboard.
    There is a control button (On/Off) shown in Figure 4 that shows the installed
    applications with the dashboard. Figure 3. Dashboard display of the mobile device
    application. Figure 4. Implementation of IOT-based systems at medium and large
    scales. The sensor and electronics are powered by DC power derived from solar
    panels, and the amount of power generated is determined by the rating of the solar
    panels. As shown in Figure 3, the solar system produces DC power for charging
    the battery via the charging kit. This power can be directed to the inverter by
    the inverter circuit. The inverter is needed to convert the DC power to AC because
    older water pumps run on AC power. In order to implement this system, we have
    used a number of hardware components, such as: (a) Solar panels, (b) Charging
    kits, (c) Batteries, and (d) Inverters. It has become possible to implement the
    software on a mobile phone. However, the oversized bloated network model is not
    conducive to the deployment of the device’s software. 7. Real-Time Implementation
    A schematic diagram of the automated irrigation system is shown in Figure 1. The
    system is designed with devices capable of controlling water delivery, a management
    unit, a soil moisture sensing unit, and an on-spot processing unit, as shown in
    Figure 4. The remote database is an installation to store the contiguous farming
    data structure. Climatic parameters, including soil moisture level, are obtained
    from the sector of each sensory mote. Through the personal interface of the internet
    utility, the user can control the water valve by converting the positioning monitor
    to real-time climate situations within the field. There are many factors that
    affect actual water usage, including the type of plants, the evapotranspiration
    rate, the amount of field area, the type of valves and the pipes, the distance
    between the valves, and the number of waterings per day. Taking all these parameters
    into consideration, and using Equation (1), we can calculate the actual amount
    of water that needs to be applied to the field. Time= Area×( K c + ET r )×60 F×N
    ×100 /Period (1) where Time is the irrigation time in minutes, Kc is the crop
    coefficient (here, the coefficient ranges between approximately 7.04 mm/day and
    11.7 mm/day), F is the water flow per valve in m3/h, N is the number of valves,
    and Area is the field area in m2. Based on Equation (1) and how much data can
    be input to achieve accurate results, three analyses have been done and compared
    to the performance of a normal irrigation system: Calculation of irrigation times
    using Equation (1) and forecast data; The irrigation system is controlled by Equation
    (1) and sensor data; Controlled irrigation system using Equation (1) and sensor
    data to estimate irrigation times. There is no doubt that the concept and applications
    of the IoT (Internet of Things) are becoming more and more relevant in our world.
    This can be attributed to the fact that there is the possibility of interconnecting
    any object or device through the network. This can be done by using various types
    of communication technologies and protocols. This interconnection can be achieved
    by using a variety of different types of networks, some of the best-known and
    widely disseminated ones being WiFi (Wireless Fidelity), LTE (Long-Term Evolution),
    Bluetooth, and so on. Based on the proposed system, we intend to validate the
    implementation of a WSN environment in medium-scale crops for a specific crop
    variation and an area specific to the crop. The main objective of this study was
    to minimize the cost of the sensor devices whilst optimizing the technical characteristics
    that the deployed devices should have. As a result of this information, it will
    be possible in the future to produce on a large scale monitored and sustainable
    crops, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. An overview of the output in a graphical
    format—soil moisture. 8. Results and Discussion IoT applications have developed
    a variety of specialized communication protocols that have the potential to become
    long-term standards with global acceptance and that are associated with significant
    benefits at the time of their implementation as well. It is still critical to
    know the specifications and technical capabilities of each protocol in order to
    choose the one that is appropriate for your application and environment. Therefore,
    the macro project that led to the publication of this article proposed the creation
    of a model that could be used to analyze and simulate the behavior of the key
    performance indicators of the system. The information provided in this paper is
    structured in such a way that it becomes a very comprehensive decision-making
    tool that contributes to the research and development of relevant knowledge in
    this field as well as the implementation of it in environments. As a result of
    providing the sensors with data in the form of voltage, this data is presented
    to the microcontroller. The microcontroller, after calibrating these values, gives
    us the moisture content of the soil in percentage values. The data is sent continuously
    from the IoT device to the online site through the wireless network to be displayed
    on the computer screen being used. The dashboard display is also refreshed every
    three seconds to make sure the real-time data availability, and just in case of
    possible Internet disruption, reloading page will let us know about it. This model
    is designed to manage water for irrigating date palm trees. The development and
    improvement of date palms require a lot of water in order to grow and improve
    the quality of the dates at harvest time. However, it should be noted that consistent
    dry weather leads to insufficient water as a result of dispersal, waste, and penetration.
    Precise irrigation will help in achieving remarkable yields from the date palm.
    However, at the same time, the quality of the dates will still depend on the decision
    of when to harvest. Figure 5 shows the output of the proposed model in graphical
    form. There is no better way to display data than to use a graphical representation
    in the form of a diagram. Also, visual representations are much more memorable.
    As we not only display the moisture content (data) as text but also in visual
    form, this helps the user to quickly and easily notice the sudden changes in the
    data or information that has been displayed. Data were collected from each sensor
    node of the WSN containing real-time information about the environmental conditions
    of the farm. The set of data collected that represents the year as a whole is
    shown in Figure 6. The winter season in the study area starts at the end of October
    and lasts until the beginning of February. November and December are the months
    when the weather is at its most pleasant. As a result, less water is needed for
    irrigation, which is in contrast with summertime, when it is mostly dry and needs
    a lot more water. Figure 6. Data collected during the whole year in Saudi Arabia.
    The first thing to note is that, in the testing period, there are no rain periods
    in Saudi Arabia. This means that watering is mainly done when soil moisture is
    less than 30%. It is also possible to note that humidity levels in Saudi Arabia
    are high at that time of year, which helps the soil moisture to decline more slowly.
    Therefore, the water used for irrigation can be less. The measurement of humidity
    parameters in the soil and the subsequent processing of this information constitutes
    a fundamental element for decision-making in the technical environments of smart
    agriculture. This leads, for example, to establishing the appropriate sowing and
    harvesting periods to improve the productivity of dates in Saudi Arabia. Smart
    farms are an especially significant aspect that must be addressed by systems engineering,
    electronic engineering, and data science. The analysis of large volumes of information
    using time series, big data, data mining, and other analysis methodologies allows
    the finding of patterns that allow intelligent decision-making. This allows us
    to improve and optimize different plants in the Agro sector. Thanks to the integration
    of the IoT and different sensors in cloud platforms, it is possible to improve
    many aspects related to plant growth. This includes saving on inputs and pest
    control. The novelty of this work lies in the implementation of the idea through
    the use of components and devices available in the market as shown in Figure 6.
    However, it is through the development of the user interface shown in Figure 4
    that the authors realized their search for real-time data acquisition. The quantifiable
    characterization of the soil through the use of spectral characteristics for each
    pixel in an image of a scene is another attractive area to be pursued for cloud-based
    non-intrusive irrigation systems, soil data, or underground water quality collection
    [27]. 9. Conclusions This proposed irrigation system can measure soil moisture
    and temperature as well as the atmospheric temperature of the field and can transmit
    the data in real-time to the user using Wi-Fi and an IoT server. The IoT-based
    irrigation system is superior to other irrigation systems recently proposed and
    developed. This is because, in the past, the process of implementing automatic
    irrigation was done in a traditional, luxurious, and inefficient manner, which
    results in a small profit margin and misfortunes in production. This paper proposes
    the utilization of IoT communication to develop an automated irrigation system
    for agricultural monitoring. This analysis has allowed the authors to confirm
    that the implementation model has the capability of being more effective, accurate,
    and responsive in a very short period of time. Additionally, the proposed model
    is better than existing models based on the Internet of Things due to the advantages
    it offers compared to those models: by creating a dashboard based on the HTTP
    protocol, users will be able to change parameters such as moisture and water flow
    rates through IoT devices, as well as turn on/off water pumps. Future work may
    include the integration of sensor grids in order to be able to determine important
    parameters such as pH, CEC, SAR, organic constituents of the soil, and other crucial
    parameters. The paper is produced with a critical review of contemporary literature
    and the use of an algorithm to support the title. It makes a useful contribution
    to the body of engineering knowledge through the use of simple electronics and
    simple program code for application development. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: 'The inclusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in greenhouses has become
    a fundamental tool for improving cultivation systems, offering information relevant
    to the greenhouse manager for decision making in search of optimum yield. This
    article presents a monitoring system applied to an aeroponic greenhouse based
    on an IoT architecture that provides user information on the status of the climatic
    variables and the appearance of the crop in addition to managing the irrigation
    timing and the frequency of visual inspection using an application developed for
    Android mobile devices called Aeroponics Monitor. The proposed IoT architecture
    consists of four layers: a device layer, fog layer, cloud layer and application
    layer. Once the information about the monitored variables is obtained by the sensors
    of the device layer, the fog layer processes it and transfers it to the Thingspeak
    and Firebase servers. In the cloud layer, Thingspeak analyzes the information
    from the variables monitored in the greenhouse through its IoT analytic tools
    to generate historical data and visualizations of their behavior, as well as an
    analysis of the system’s operating status. Firebase, on the other hand, is used
    as a database to store the results of the processing of the images taken in the
    fog layer for the supervision of the leaves and roots. The results of the analysis
    of the information of the monitored variables and of the processing of the images
    are presented in the developed app, with the objective of visualizing the state
    of the crop and to know the function of the monitoring system in the event of
    a possible lack of electricity or a service line failure in the fog layer and
    to avoid the loss of information. With the information about the temperature of
    the plant leaf and the relative humidity inside the greenhouse, the vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD) in the cloud layer is calculated; the VPD values are available on
    the Thingspeak server and in the developed app. Additionally, an analysis of the
    VPD is presented that demonstrates a water deficiency from the transplanting of
    the seedling to the cultivation chamber. The IoT architecture presented in this
    paper represents a potential tool for the study of aeroponic farming systems through
    IoT-assisted monitoring.'

    on the status of the climatic variables and the appearance of the crop in addition
    to managing the irrigation timing and the frequency of visual inspection using
    an application developed for Android mobile devices called Aeroponics Monitor.
    The proposed IoT architecture consists of four layers: a device layer, fog layer,
    cloud layer and application layer. Once the information about the monitored variables
    is obtained by the sensors of the device layer, the fog layer processes it and
    transfers it to the Thingspeak and Firebase servers. In the cloud layer, Thingspeak
    analyzes the information from the variables monitored in the greenhouse through
    its IoT analytic tools to generate historical data and visualizations of their
    behavior, as well as an analysis of the system’s operating status. Firebase, on
    the other hand, is used as a database to store the results of the processing of
    the images taken in the fog layer for the supervision of the leaves and roots.
    The results of the analysis of the information of the monitored variables and
    of the processing of the images are presented in the developed app, with the objective
    of visualizing the state of the crop and to know the function of the monitoring
    system in the event of a possible lack of electricity or a service line failure
    in the fog layer and to avoid the loss of information. With the information about
    the temperature of the plant leaf and the relative humidity inside the greenhouse,
    the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the cloud layer is calculated; the VPD values
    are available on the Thingspeak server and in the developed app. Additionally,
    an analysis of the VPD is presented that demonstrates a water deficiency from
    the transplanting of the seedling to the cultivation chamber. The IoT architecture
    presented in this paper represents a potential tool for the study of aeroponic
    farming systems through IoT-assisted monitoring. Keywords: aeroponic; greenhouse;

    1. Introduction The fundamental resources for traditional agriculture are farmland,
    soil and water. Conventional greenhouses require colossal infrastructures, having
    among their limitations uncontrolled environments, smaller farmland, plant diseases,
    soil degradation and a lack of resources, among others, leading to reduced crop
    production [1]. With the increasing demand for food, the role of agriculture demands
    the efficient use of resources and increased production. An option to improve
    farming systems focuses on stress monitoring and stress-causing factors in cultivation
    [2]. Consequently, various technologies have emerged for the conservation and
    use of water and energy, in addition to the benefits in increasing the production
    of multiple crops. Among the technologies that have had the most impact are wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), computing in the cloud, fog computing, embedded systems,
    big data, machine–machine (M2M) and human–machine communication (H2M), communication
    protocols, application programming interfaces (API), and advanced encryption standards
    (AES), as well as the use of geo-location, satellites and servers, among others
    [3]. In Mexico, it is necessary to increase agricultural production by at least
    70% by 2050, increasing surface yield and reducing the amount of water consumed
    [4]. Recently, organizations such as the Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo
    Rural, the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (Conacyt) and the Instituto
    Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (INIFAP) have agreed
    on the collaboration on and transfer of technology for cultivation in soil for
    semi-arid areas [5]. As time goes by, climate change and water scarcity drive
    national and international organizations to generate strategies to increase crop
    yield by making the most of water despite climatic adversities. Aeroponics is
    a vertical cultivation method in which the plant grows suspended over a container,
    while a mist of nutrients is applied to the roots inside a protection chamber
    [6]. The nutrient solution is atomized on the root surface; for this, a pump is
    used that is in charge of the oxygen level in the root zone [7]. Since the nutrient
    solution is recirculated in the aeroponic cultivation technique, it is important
    to regularly measure and readjust the pH value and electrical conductivity (EC)
    to have a successful growth of the plant. If the pH and EC readings are not at
    the proper level, the cultivator should adjust the acidity and electroconductivity
    in the nutritious solution so that each crop has specific EC and pH levels; for
    example, the optimal EC and pH values for growing onions, cucumbers, carrots,
    lettuce, tomatoes and potatoes are between 1.5 to 2.5 ds m−1 and 5.5 to 6.5, respectively
    [8]. The pH and EC of a nutrient solution may be reduced due to environmental
    factors such as high temperatures causing water evaporation or the absorption
    of nutrients by plants [9]. In traditional soilless cultivation systems, such
    as hydroponics, where the EC and pH correction is performed manually, monitoring
    the temperature of the nutrient solution is sorely needed since the results of
    the conductivity and pH are directly influenced by this parameter [10]. The lifetime
    of the solution is of the utmost importance and will depend on timely adjustments
    made to the pH, electrical conductivity and water level. To exclude changes in
    the nutrient solution, the volume level in the storage tank must remain constant,
    replenishing the water absorbed by the plants and lost by evapotranspiration,
    otherwise, the concentration of the salts will change, affecting the healthy growth
    of the plants [11]. The practice of aeroponics is adaptable in areas where the
    soil is not suitable for growth of the plants, presenting advantages such as:
    a reduction in the cost of labor, savings in water of up to 98%, 60% in fertilizers
    and 10% in pesticides and herbicides, and maximizing the yield of the plant to
    between 45% and 75% compared to geoponic or hydroponic systems [8]. In comparison
    to cultivation techniques such as hydroponics and substrate, aeroponics has revealed
    a significant increment in root length, area, volume and network perimeter [12,13].
    With respect to traditional agriculture, in aeroponics increments of 57%, 42%
    and 400% in the number of leaves, diameter of the leaves and root growth, respectively,
    considering a temperature inside the greenhouse between 8 °C and 44 °C and a relative
    humidity between 10% and 94%, have been observed [14]. On the other hand, in Mexico,
    59.5% of the population has access to the Internet, which enables a high percentage
    of people to use and develop Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to improve
    the use of resources in agricultural crops [15]. Having described the above, assisted
    aeroponics with IoT tools appears to be a very attractive alternative to obtain
    crops of greater quantity and quality. One of the main challenges in aeroponics
    is to determine the atomization time and time interval in irrigation according
    to the needs of each plant [8]. To avoid a significant decrease in plant growth
    and reduction in crop yield, it is crucial to determine the threshold level to
    which each plant can be subjected under conditions of irrigation deficiency [16].
    When a crop is under water stress, the root of the plant begins to turn dark,
    increasing its temperature. An indirect way to detect crop water needs is through
    changes in crop temperature and transpiration by measuring the crop water stress
    index (CWSI) [17], evapotranspiration (ET) [18], temperature difference between
    the environment and the leaf [19] and, recently, through the vapor pressure deficit
    (VPD) [20]. In arid and semi-arid regions, a crop is under water stress when the
    leaf temperature exceeds the air temperature from 4 °C to 6 °C; likewise, a crop
    does not present water stress when the temperature of the leaf is from 1 °C to
    4 °C below the air temperature [21]. The water stress index can be calculated
    empirically by measuring the difference in temperature between the environment
    and the crop and normalizing it with respect to the differences between a humid
    crop due to high transpiration and a crop with low humidity due to the absence
    of moisture, or theoretically through the measurement of solar radiation, temperature
    and humidity in the environment and the temperature of the crop [22]. VPD and
    the change in the temperature difference with plant transpiration can be measured
    through leaf temperature, environmental temperature and relative humidity [23].
    Evapotranspiration can be averaged through different methods, with the Penman—Monteith
    method being the most globally accepted; however, for this estimation the measurement
    of temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure
    and steam pressure saturation is required [24]. Related to the transpiration of
    a growing crop, the transpiration rate of a crop varies according to changes in
    atmospheric conditions, and one of the special factors is the VPD. A high VPD
    causes an increase in the rate of transpiration and therefore an excessive consumption
    of water and the photosynthetic limitation of the crop. A VPD above 1 kPa is potentially
    harmful, producing a reduction in stomatal conductance, making photosynthesis
    impossible and generating water stress even if the roots of the crop are well
    irrigated [20]. Reports of consecutive trials have recently been presented on
    crops on substrate applied to Salanova lettuce considering controlled environments
    in light intensity and temperature to modify the relative humidity and achieve
    a VPD of 0.7 kPa and 1.7 kPa during the growth cycle [20], following the methodology
    described in [25]. In these, it was found that the plant area was significantly
    greater in the crop developed with a low VPD. Other studies in tomato cultivation
    show that a low VPD moderates water stress, regulating the photosynthetic limitations
    of the plant and reducing the cumulative water consumption regardless of soil
    water status [26]. The fine regulation of and the decrease in VPD fluctuations
    are also crucial to produce a better crop growth since maintaining the photosynthetic
    performance of the plant leads to the leaf expansion being maintained and a higher
    yield being produced with high nutrition values [27]. In soil tomato cultivation
    systems, the applicability of IoT sensors was demonstrated to study the variations
    in the parameters of temperature, relative humidity and VPD [28]. Significant
    deviations from optimal climatic conditions due to imprecise heating and cooling
    systems used in commercial greenhouses were revealed in this study. To address
    water stress, techniques based on temperature measurement from infrared sensors
    [23] and thermographic cameras have been used in the literature [29]. When using
    a thermal imager, a common technique for segmenting vegetative content is the
    simultaneous capture of visible spectrum (RGB) and multispectral images to determine
    the threshold of color components, generating a binary mask that will cover the
    thermal image and will show only the information of the vegetative components
    [29]. In aeroponics systems, the root development process is crucial for the plant’s
    growth performance. In order to optimize the plant’s aerial parts in aeroponic
    culture, the appropriate value definition of irrigation water pressure, droplet
    size and fogging interval is needed to improve the continuous water and nutrient
    availability [30,31]. Recently, non-invasive monitoring systems have been proposed
    for the study of vegetative growth parameters in roots and leaves developed in
    greenhouses [31]. Implementing and promoting the initial conditions for a healthy
    crop, using IoT-based technologies, requires monitoring devices with capabilities
    to acquire and analyze environmental, nutritional and crop data. In order to develop
    studies on soilless cultivation and determine better cultivation practices, monitoring
    of and controlling the main sensors and actuators involved in the aeroponic cultivation
    system are needed. The purpose of study in this paper is to determine the feasibility
    of integrating intelligent sensors, for the measurement of climatic conditions
    in the environment and crops as well as providing nutrient solutions, that allow
    favorable conditions for crop growth in aeroponic systems with IoT-based technologies.
    Considered variables for our proposal are temperature and relative humidity both
    in the greenhouse and in the plant leaf, VPD and luminosity, as well as the level,
    temperature, pH and EC in the nutrient solution tanks. The proposed system presents
    the analysis of the information acquired by the sensors, the operating status
    of each of the elements incorporated in the platform using IoT analytics Thingspeak
    tools, as well as the initial preprocessing of the images acquired in the inspection
    from the leaf and root. Once the plant has been transplanted to the cultivation
    chamber, the plant must adapt to the defined irrigation scheme during the first
    week; therefore, the operation of each component incorporated in the proposed
    monitoring system is verified in the same period. For the experimentation, Batavia
    lettuce was chosen because its duration of the cultivation process is relatively
    short compared to other crops. The monitoring system incorporates the use of an
    application for mobile devices capable of showing records and visualizations from
    the analysis of information acquired by the built-in sensors and processed by
    the IoT analytics Thingspeak tools; in addition, the app records the measurements
    of the environmental conditions, the status and readjustment of the pH and EC
    of the nutrient solution, access to the irrigation controls and the recirculation
    and the mixer of the system. Additionally, the platform has a standard thermographic
    camera (8–14 μm); each of its captured images are transferred to the platform
    through an SMB server, which allows them to be viewed in the Aeroponics Monitor
    application. The Aeroponics Monitor was developed as a remote viewing and administration
    tool that allows users to modify the atomization time and the hours for the visual
    inspection of the crop, as well as the turning on and off of the sprinklers, the
    recirculation system and the mixture of nutrient solution, as well as maintenance
    tasks of the full system. The main advantages addressed by the proposal presented
    in this study are the remote administration of system actuators, the monitoring
    of each of the sensors incorporated in the greenhouse, the remote capture of images
    of the crops and the visualization of historical variables and data reports on
    the operation of each of the processes that are incorporated in the monitoring
    system, with all the above carried out through an application for Android mobile
    devices. This document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature
    review that refers to the platforms and architectures used for the management
    of irrigation in crops. The configuration of the aeroponic system, description
    of the proposed monitoring system and the description of the Aeroponics Monitor
    application are presented in Section 3. Section 4 shows the results, while Section
    5 presents the discussion and relevant contributions obtained in this work. Finally,
    in Section 6, the conclusions and future work are presented. The notation used
    for this article is described in Table 1. Table 1. Notation and nomenclature used
    for this article. 2. Literature Review 2.1. Agriculture-Oriented IoT Architectures
    There are multiple proposals in the literature referring to IoT architectures
    used in intelligent agriculture; among the most recent are AREThOU5A, AgriSens,
    IRRISENS, Agro-IoT, SWAMP and a proposed four-layered architecture by Kour in
    2020, each referring to soil agriculture. Kamienski et al. propose SWAMP, a generalized
    architecture oriented to the intelligent management of irrigation for agricultural
    systems on the ground incorporating different interconnection strategies between
    its elements to address the problems of communication in greenhouses on a large-scale
    using fog nodes in the soil with LoRaWAN routers. Its architecture is made up
    of five layers, which include the sending of information to end users, distribution
    models for irrigation, use of drones for vision inspection, data analysis models
    in the cloud fog nodes using as references the relative humidity of the soil,
    databases, security for data acquisition, sensors, actuators and weather reports,
    among others [32]. Based on the literature reviewed by Kour et al. from 2015 to
    2020 and related to the advances and development of agriculture, the authors show,
    as a conceptual representation, a reference to IoT architecture for agriculture
    made up of six layers (Agro-IoT), including: a perception layer for sensors, actuators,
    wireless nodes, etc.; a network layer that encompasses the communication protocols,
    software middle layer, application layer for data analysis and prediction; a user
    layer where results are directed to farmers, experts in the area, the supply chain
    and industries. With the aim of monitoring low-scale greenhouses in real time,
    optimizing resource use, the early detection of diseases, identification of crop
    species, optimization of irrigation facilities and effective use of pesticides
    and fertilizers, the authors propose an IoT architecture for solar precision agriculture
    with four layers, including: a sensory layer, a network layer considering IoT
    nodes and base stations; a decision layer involving server services, workstations,
    work and knowledge base; an application layer involving how researchers, experts
    and farmers receive the information [33]. Filev et al. propose IRISENS, which
    is an architecture made up of five modules: the devices and network, kernel, external
    services, data management, intelligent services and user interface. In their proposal,
    they incorporate two models of microservices, one oriented to irrigation management
    based on the evapotranspiration of the crop and another for the collection of
    data from sensors and weather prediction services. Additionally, they incorporate
    data authentication between each module [34]. Boursians et al. suggest AREThOU5A
    a five-layer structure involving a physical layer, data link, network, authentication
    and application. Its main contribution is the integration of a weather forecast
    service to define better cultivation strategies, as well as the ability to use
    machine learning in data analysis and a solar charging system for RF communication
    devices located in the field [35]. Roy et al. propose Agrisens, described as an
    architecture of three layers: sensors and actuators, remote processing and service,
    and an application layer. The irrigation schemes are separated according to the
    life cycle of the crop in four stages considering the situations where the crop
    remains with water in the soil, irrigation under dry soil conditions and irrigation
    under wet soil conditions. Its structure offers the farmer the establishment of
    communication with the system through GSM messaging [36]. 2.2. Irrigation Systems
    Irrigation systems have been used in soil and soilless crops. Some of the most
    relevant ones are described below. In soil cultivation, there are different approaches
    to estimate irrigation needs in cultivation, highlighting the monitoring and control
    of the environmental temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration and water
    stress index. Authors such as González-Amarillo [37] and Fernández-Ahumada [38]
    use humidity and/or temperature measurement to turn on irrigation, ventilation
    and heating systems, while Mohamed [39] and Poyen [40] estimate the irrigation
    needs by performing the daily evapotranspiration measurement as reference. While
    Mohamed uses the Penman–Monteith method, Poyen includes as a feature of his system
    the automatic choice between the Hargreaves and Samni, Kharufa and Penman–Monteith
    methods according to climate type and geographical considerations. Jamroen et
    al. use a fuzzy controller to adjust the irrigation considering the variables
    of humidity and water stress index [22], while Lloret et al. perform irrigation
    by flooding, allowing automatic irrigation by measuring crop variables and climatic
    conditions, or remote activation using a mobile app [41]. In soilless farming,
    Puengsungwan et al. propose a method to determine root stress in relation to the
    difference in environmental leaf temperature and light intensity in hydroponic
    crops considering environmental temperature control between 28 and 32 °C. In their
    proposal, the patterns obtained are separated by regions considering a normal
    root, with stress and a rotting root. Using IoT technologies, they reduce the
    response time of the system from 5 min to less than 60 s and increase the efficiency
    in detection from 85% to 95% in comparison with a method based on identifying
    the reduction in the leaf area of the crop by means of the Easy Leaf Area app
    [23]. In aeroponic crops, the main variables monitored to manage the irrigation
    systems are the temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse. Lucero et al.,
    monitored the temperature and humidity inside a greenhouse used for aeroponic
    cultivation, establishing the times of irrigation for the day and night under
    three stages according to the days of production. In their proposal, when the
    temperature exceeds 35 °C, the irrigation period is reduced. In their study, they
    compared a crop of 21 lettuces showing that an aeroponic system outperforms the
    traditional crop in soil in terms of the number of leaves, average diameter of
    the leaves and average length of the root by 57%, 42% and 40%, respectively [14].
    Jamhari et al. present the control of the relative temperature and humidity in
    the root chamber, in which they turn on a Peltier cell that cools the nutrient
    solution maintaining a range from 25 to 29 °C in the chamber, while the relative
    humidity is controlled between 50% and 70% through an ultrasonic humidifier and
    a fan [42]. Gour et al. propose the use of a central processor with an interface
    between sensors, actuators and machine learning tools to automate the cultivation
    process [43]. On the other hand, some proposals consider the use of IoT architectures
    for the monitoring and control of devices. Aiming to implement a vertical cultivation
    chamber to care for crops from germination to harvest, Belista et al. present
    the design of a vertical cultivation chamber distributed in master and slave modules.
    The master module controls the nutrient containers, the water-cooling system,
    an evaporative fan and a power supply, while the slave modules control the pumps
    that transport the nutrients to the crop. The IoT architecture that is presented
    to manipulate the weather control systems, the aeroponic irrigation and the mixing
    chamber for nutrients is based on a central controller, which reads and writes
    commands to acquire information from the sensors and thus manipulates the system
    actuators. The information acquired is stored locally, where the user can access
    the information through an application for mobile devices that is linked to the
    central controller through a SAMBA server [44]. According to the literature, there
    are a wide variety of IoT architectures according to the functionality and elements
    that each author defines between communication, the database, devices integrated
    into the network, security, services or microservices and their relationship with
    the end user. Similarly, among the various forms of cultivation, the variables
    in common are temperature, humidity, transpiration and luminosity. The previously
    mentioned proposals present connectivity schemes mainly oriented to the acquisition
    of information from climate sensors for weather conditions, control of actuators
    for the adjustment of weather conditions and irrigation schemes, and user access
    to the systems to supervise the information collected and to be able to modify
    the irrigation strategies; nevertheless, they do not contemplate the study of
    climatic variables for the analysis of the VPD and the appearance of water stress.
    To approach the study of water stress in relation to the frequency and time of
    irrigation, as well as the climatic variables in the environment and cultivation
    in a practical way in aeroponic systems, the system proposed in this study integrates
    features such as crop temperature measurement, irrigation programming, automation
    through microservices, the use of a central processor and the integration of a
    SAMBA server as addressed by Puengsungwan, Lucero, Loret, Gour and Belista, respectively.
    However, our proposal has sensory elements, processing, administration, storage
    and remote access through a 4-layer IoT architecture with the flexibility of incorporating
    more sensory elements, processing and decision-making capabilities through the
    fog layer, and system administration functions in the user layer for further studies
    to modify the functional structure of the proposed IoT architecture. The IoT architecture
    presented consists of an end devices layer, fog layer, cloud layer and application
    layer. Among the main features incorporated in our proposal are the following:
    The grouping of electronic sensors and vision systems with end devices. The administration
    of end devices through independent services for reading sensors, and the remote
    activation of actuators and acquisition systems for standard WEB, USB and thermographic
    cameras using a SAMBA server. Additionally, it has an alert service via SMTP in
    case of failure of the other services. All of the above is through the fog layer.
    A local and cloud database. The local database is dedicated to the storage of
    RGB top, side and root images, as well as thermographic images in the root. The
    database in the cloud is used for the storage of time-series data generated by
    the electronic sensors, in addition to the status of the sensors and actuators,
    the operating status of the services of the system, as well as the storage of
    the last result of the image processing. The implementation of an Android application
    for the manual registration of the variables related to the nutrient solution,
    environmental conditions, crop yield, historical display, data analysis reports,
    as well as the remote acquisition of images, activation of actuators and modification
    of irrigation parameters. Table 2 highlights the main characteristics of each
    architecture with respect to our proposal. Table 2. Comparison considering elements
    included for monitoring, control and irrigation. 3. Monitoring System 3.1. Aeroponic
    System Setup The aeroponic growing chamber is formed by a structure with an upper
    base of 2000 × 300 mm and holes of 55 mm, with a spacing of 30 mm for the placement
    of 5 lettuces. Inside the growth chamber, a 2.5-inch duct was placed along the
    structure, where 5 sprinkler nozzles as well as a collector duct for the excess
    nutrient solution that returns from the crop (Figure 1). The nutritive solution
    tanks used by the irrigation and recirculation system have a capacity of 83.5
    and 21.5 L; in both tanks the level and temperature are monitored using the HC-SR04
    (LS2 and LS3) and DS18B20 (TS2 and TS3) sensors. Two R385 diaphragm pumps are
    used to distribute and recover the nebulized nutrient solution from the roots.
    When the level of the recirculation tank exceeds 16 L, a pump is activated to
    transport the recovered nutrient solution to the main tank, later using a submersible
    pump with a capacity of 160 L/h to mix the solution inside the main tank. Figure
    1. Aeroponic growing chamber. For the measurement of the environmental temperature,
    the leaf temperature and the relative humidity of the leaf, the sensors MLX90614
    (TS1ca) and HTU21D (HS1c) are used; these are located on the upper part of the
    lettuce leaf, while for the variables of relative humidity of the environment,
    luminous sensors HTU21D (HS1a) and BH1750 (IS1a) are used, which are located above
    the aeroponic chamber. For crop growth recording regarding the height of the plant
    and leaf area, two cameras with acquisition capacities over the visible spectrum
    are considered, a webcam (LC4) and an IP camera (UC4), both located on the structure
    of the growth chamber, one on the side and the other on the top. For the registration
    of the colorimetry, the length of the root and the temperature in the root chamber,
    RGB and thermographic images are captured by a standard thermographic camera (IC5)
    and sent to the fog layer by connecting the thermographic camera to a mobile device
    or computer through an SMB user. Figure 2 shows the location of the sensory elements
    for the measurement of the previously described variables, as well as the visual
    inspection systems. Figure 2. Location of sensors and visual inspection system.
    3.2. Monitoring System Proposal The proposed monitoring system is based on a four-layer
    IoT architecture: device layer, fog layer, cloud layer and application layer (Figure
    3). In Figure 1 and Figure 2, the end devices incorporated in the device layer
    of Figure 3 are labeled. End device 1 (ED1) integrates the sensors used for the
    measurement of temperature and luminosity in the greenhouse, as well as with the
    leaf temperature and humidity sensors. End device 2 (ED2) integrates the level
    and temperature sensors of the recirculating solution tank, as well as the pump
    activation system for the stages of irrigation, recirculation and mixing between
    the recovered nutrient solution and that stored in the main tank. End device 3
    (ED3) integrates sensors for level and temperature measurement from the main solution
    tank. End device 4 (ED4) integrates the cameras used for the registration of the
    growth of the crop. Finally, end device 5 (ED5) is made up of a thermographic
    camera and a mobile device to send the information to the fog layer. The device
    layer consists of five end devices, ED1, ED2 and ED3 are made up of NodeMCU development
    boards based on Web Server, ED4 has a standard USB camera and an IP camera, both
    managed by the fog layer through a Raspberry development board, as long as the
    device has a standard USB thermal imager connected to a mobile device based on
    SMB. The information acquired by each end device is transmitted to the fog layer.
    Figure 3. IoT architecture of the monitoring system. The fog layer is made up
    of a set of microservices in charge of managing the information locally or remotely
    through one of several servers in the cloud. Locally, 4 services are executed
    independently: irrigation service in charge of turning the sprinkler system on
    and off according to the irrigation frequency and the day and night switch-on
    time programmed by the user; reservoir service responsible for monitoring the
    level of the secondary tank and generating the recirculation of the nutrient solution
    to the main tank; the camera service in charge of taking screenshots of the plant
    from the side and top view according to the schedule programmed by the user, generating
    a local database; likewise, it is in charge of processing the images coming from
    all the cameras installed in the system; CV-GUI Services, the remote user interface
    used to manage system settings and status. On the other hand, the sensor service,
    control service and alert service microservices manage the exchange of information
    between the sensors, local microservices and the Thingspeak server. The sensor
    service is responsible for collecting information from each one of the sensors
    of the environmental variables, the nutrient solution, as well as the state of
    execution of the irrigation systems, the recirculation of the nutrient solution
    and the activating of the cameras installed to upload the data to the cloud. The
    control service has the function of scanning the server’s control data channel
    before the start of new configurations for the irrigation system and the camera
    system, as well as the remote activation of the sprinkler nozzles, the recirculating
    stage and the nutrient solution mixer. The alert services are in charge of monitoring
    the operation of all the services; in case one of them is interrupted by a failure,
    it sends an alert via SMTP. In addition to the microservices, the fog layer integrates
    an SMB server, which allows connectivity between the standard thermographic camera
    and the image database through its USB connection to an Android, Windows or Linux
    device, and this in turn as an SMB user. The cloud layer is made up of the data
    storage and analytics services built into the Thingspeak and Firebase platforms.
    Thingspeak is used as a database with a time-series format, as well as for data
    analysis and visualization of results through its IoT analytics tools. For this
    investigation, four Thingspeak channels are used for: the administration of the
    variables of the environmental temperature, the temperature in the leaf, the relative
    humidity in the environment and the leaf, the level and the temperature of the
    recirculation deposit, as well as light intensity (environmental measurements
    channel); administration of the variables related to the level and temperature
    of the main nutrient solution tank and the operating status of the chambers, the
    irrigation system and the recirculating stage (services channel); storage of variables
    ambient temperature, relative humidity, crop temperature, pH, EC, fresh weight,
    length and width of the lettuce leaf, all of them implemented manually using standard
    instruments and recorded through the app generated in this study (manual measurements
    channel); management of requests from the end user to download or update administration
    of requests for the irrigation times and camera triggers, as well as remotely
    activating the irrigation system, the recirculating stage as well as the nutrient
    solution mixer (control channel). Firebase, on the other hand, has a real-time
    database stored in JSON format, as well as a database for file storage. The use
    of Firebase is intended for the configuration of the parameters for the processing
    of the images, as well as the storage of the images processed by the fog layer,
    allowing the platform to request specific image processing services between the
    application developed in this research and the fog layer. Finally, the application
    layer is an Android app called “Aeroponics Monitor”, which, through HTTP requests,
    makes requests to the Thingspeak server for the generation of comparative or analytical
    reports between variables, performance reports of installed sensors and communication
    with the platform, historical data by variable, access to the configuration of
    the irrigation systems and the triggering of the image capture devices as well
    as the manual control of actuators through remote access, the measurement of the
    cultivation parameters and the registration of the amount of nitric acid and solution
    A and B dissolved in the nutrient solution to readjust the pH and EC ranges. Likewise,
    it has access through Firebase to the latest results of the processing of the
    images generated by the fog layer. 3.3. Aeroponics Monitor App The Aeroponics
    Monitor is an application developed at Android Studio and registered in INDAUTOR
    Mexico under the registration number 03-201-10514230-01; this application is operated
    by users to visualize the behavior of the variables and the operating status of
    the system, and control the actions of the aeroponic system actuators in a remote
    way. The Aeroponics Monitor contains eight main windows: the home window (Figure
    4a), which allows a quick view of the status of the environmental variables of
    the culture system, accessing through a menu section of reports, records, configurations,
    manual controls, manual measurements, manual readjustment and image analysis.
    Each one of them is described below. Figure 4. Windows of Aeroponics Monitor.
    (a) Initial window; (b) report window; (c) record window; (d) settings window;
    (e) manual controls window; (f) manual measurements window; (g) manual readjust
    window; (h) image analysis window. 3.3.1. The Report Window The report window
    requests a visualization of IoT analytics to Thingspeak to show the behavior of
    the last three days of a specific variable or the relationship between two or
    more variables to generate a report on the operation status of a component of
    the system (Figure 4b). The relationship between the variables and the reports
    that display this sale is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Variable—Report Relationship
    using MATLAB Analysis and Visualization. 3.3.2. Record Window The record window
    allows the view of the variables of the aeroponic system individually, showing
    an analysis of the data stored for one hour, 12 h, one day and up to three days
    by making an HTTP request to the server. Among the variables monitored in this
    section are the temperature of the nutrient solution, the environmental temperature,
    the crop temperature, the relative humidity of the environment, the relative humidity
    of the crop, luminosity, temperature of the recirculation tank and level of the
    recirculation tank (Figure 4c). 3.3.3. Settings Window The settings window gives
    users access to modify the parameters for activation of the image acquisition
    system, as well as the frequency and time of ignition (day/night) of the irrigation
    system (Figure 4d). 3.3.4. Manual Controls Window The window for manual controls
    allows a link to be established remotely with the irrigation system. Its operation
    is based on downloading the latest state of each actuator to show it on the app’s
    switches, as well as updating each state when the “SEND” button is pressed, so
    that the control service executes the orders in the greenhouse (Figure 4e). 3.3.5.
    Manual Measurements Window Through this window, the user makes a manual record
    of the evolution of crop parameters, such as fresh weight, length, width and temperature
    of the lettuce leaf; the evolution of the environmental variables considering
    the temperature and the relative humidity in the environment; the evolution of
    the parameters in the nutritive solution considering the pH and EC. All these
    parameters are stored in the server for the generation of the record and reports
    (Figure 4f). 3.3.6. Manual Readjust Window The manual readjust window allows the
    user to check the temperature and level of each tank in the aeroponic system,
    as well as a quick reading of the latest pH and EC value (Figure 4g). To readjust
    the pH and EC value, the total evacuation of the recirculation tank must be considered
    through the manual control window to later read the number of liters in the main
    tank and record the amount of nitric acid used to lower the pH, as well as the
    amount of solution A and B to compensate for the quantity of salts dissolved in
    the nutrient solution. 3.3.7. Image Analysis Window The image analysis window
    allows viewing the latest data capture taken by the image acquisition systems
    of the monitoring system. Among the results that allow visualization of the platform
    are the lateral image, the upper image, the processing of the leaf area index
    (LAI), as well as the latest RGB images and IR of leaf and root obtained by the
    thermal camera (Figure 4h). 3.4. Data Management Among the main challenges faced
    in IoT applications are data offloading, heterogeneity and big data [45]. To reduce
    the latency between the IoT sensors described in the proposal and the Thingspeak
    server, sensor service makes consecutive requests via HTTP protocol to each of
    the end devices, collecting and grouping the information, from climate and nutrient
    solution sensors, in a single package and registering it on the server. Between
    each request from sensor service to server, 30 s waiting interval is taken. To
    address the heterogeneity of the data, sensor service operates sequentially, while
    the services oriented towards image capture and irrigation and recirculation services
    operate in parallel through the camera service, irrigation service and reservoir
    service, respectively. Each service in operation generates a binary log file (npy
    file), storing the latest state of sensors and actuators, through which it shares
    the information with other services running on the fog layer. Regarding the amount
    of data that can be generated between numerical records and images through IoT
    devices, numerical records are stored in Thingspeak with a maximum of 2880 requests
    per day out of 8200 possible, while the image records from the side and upper
    view of the plant are directly stored in the SD memory on the fog layer. The number
    of images generated depends on times scheduled for image acquisition (9/day/camera
    in this experiment). 3.5. Remote Operation Remote operation of the aeroponic system
    is achieved from reading (continuous) and writing (on demand) of the control’s
    data channel (command vector), which hosts the latest status of the system’s irrigation,
    recirculation and mixer actuators, as well as the command states that trigger
    the image capture system, writing or reading of configurations referring to the
    interval and frequency of irrigation (Figure 5). Each of these states is encoded
    and decoded in the communication process between fog layer and the app. Figure
    5. Command vector for remote operation from App. Command vector is a message encoded
    in 10 bits, a bit for the activation or deactivation (1 or 0) of any actuator
    or service hosted in the fog layer, followed by a status bit to detect if the
    request has been attended or not (1 or 0) by the fog layer, ending with a parity
    bit to avoid errors in the communication between the app and fog layer. Response
    messages between the communication are stored in numerical form in Thingspeak
    control’s data channel. 3.6. Cost of Using the Platform To establish the minimum
    operating conditions of the proposed architecture, free licenses for Thingspeak
    and Firebase servers are used. Thingspeak under a free license allows a message
    limit of approximately 3 million/year or 8200 messages/day with an update rate
    of 15 s. Likewise, it allows us to use 4 channels with 8 fields for numerical
    data. Currently, the development of this work requires 27 of the 32 available
    fields. In case of requiring more fields than assigned, a student, home, standard
    or academic license can be obtained, specifying the number of channels and update
    rate (1 s as minimum) with a cost from USD 79.00 for 33 million/year/units [46].
    Among the services offered by Firebase subscription are real-time database and
    cloud storage, which are used in this project in its free mode (Spark) to store
    the most recent results of image processing according to the schedule assigned
    by camera service or downloading them by request from the app. Firebase in these
    services allows storage of 1 GB and 5 GB, respectively. In the case of the real-time
    database, it allows downloads of up to 10 GB/month and in the case of cloud storage
    a bandwidth of 1 GB/day. For higher storage, bandwidth or additional features,
    Firebase offers a pay as you go (Blaze) plan and a cost calculator in its website
    [47]. 3.7. Improvements Using a Fog Layer In cloud-based IoT environments, latency
    is often high due to the distance between IoT devices and the cloud, this increases
    cloud response time. As the number of IoT devices increases, the cloud cannot
    support the real-time demands of these [48]. According to Thingspeak, for each
    write request attended, a message is consumed [49]. By using a fog layer in our
    proposal, it allows grouping the information in packets of 8 numerical data, uploading
    them to the server using only a single request per channel. This involves handling
    writing to the server of up to 32 numeric variables with a single wait interval.
    On the other hand, Firebase has the Firebase ML service, which has models with
    the ability to recognize text, image labeling, object detection and tracking,
    among others; however, it is limited to the use of TensorFlow Lite models [50].
    Using a fog layer as a central processing element allows the execution of multiple
    vision algorithms without dependence on external service or additional usage cost.
    In consideration of the use of Firebase only as storage for image processing results,
    the bandwidth used to download data from the server to the app implies only 150.05
    kB/request/user. 4. Results In order to test the functionality of the monitoring
    system, a Batavia lettuce seedling was subjected to observation in the aeroponic
    crop chamber for 7 days from its transplant, placed in the main tank with 50 L
    of prepared nutritive solution with 5 mL/l of solution A and 5 mL solution B,
    with pH initial 6.0 y EC 915 ppm. From the transplant, the platform was set up
    to irrigate the seedling every 24 min day/night with an activation time of 30
    s; likewise, the lateral and frontal image acquisition system was set up to perform
    shots at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 17:30, 18:30 and 19:30 h. RGB
    and thermal images on the root were captured between 14:00 and 14:30 h. The status
    of climatic and crop variables was acquired every 30 s. The pH level and the electrical
    conductivity were taken manually daily, as well as the manual measurement of the
    dimensions of the lettuce leaf and its fresh weight. The results of this study
    have been classified into two sections: the first section refers to the registration
    of the monitored variables and the reports generated by the IoT analytics in the
    Thingspeak server, as well as the registration of images stored in the fog layer;
    the second section focuses on the analysis of the environmental variables and
    the findings made by contrasting them with the RGB and thermographic images captured.
    4.1. Record of Monitored Variables and Image Acquisition System Figure 6 shows
    the recording of environmental variables in a Thingspeak channel; the following
    are recorded: (a) environmental temperature of the HTU21D sensor, (b) environmental
    temperature of the MLX90614 sensor, (c) crop temperature, (d) relative humidity,
    (e) relative humidity in the crop, (f) luminosity, (g) temperature of the recirculating
    solution and (h) level of recirculating solution. Figure 6. Recording of environmental
    variables in a Thingspeak channel. (a) Environmental temperature of the HTU21D
    sensor; (b) environmental temperature of the MLX90614 sensor; (c) crop temperature;
    (d) relative humidity; (e) relative humidity in the crop; (f) luminosity; (g)
    temperature of the recirculating solution; (h) level of recirculating solution.
    A second Thingspeak channel is used for reporting the status of critical microservices
    (Figure 7), such as: (a) the irrigation system activation log, (b) the recirculation
    pump trigger, (c) trigger of the image acquisition system and (d) the recording
    of successful measurements by the sensors of the environmental variables channel.
    These indicators are vital to determine the functionality and failure detection
    of the electronic systems connected to the architecture: failure events in the
    irrigation system, recirculation and image acquisition systems, are visually appreciated
    by the absence of shown impulses in Figure 7a–c, respectively; electrical failure
    of any electronic sensor, is visually appreciated by the decrease in amplitude
    in (d). Since this is a numerical register that varies from 0 to 255 and is generated
    as a union of 8 bits, each bit is an indicator of the correct reading of each
    electronic sensor incorporated in the architecture, 1 or 0 if the reading is successful
    or not, respectively. If a bit frequently remains on 0, this implies a communication
    problem with the sensor and its possible need for replacement. Figure 7. Status
    of critical microservices. (a) Irrigation system activation log; (b) recirculation
    system activation log; (c) triggers of the image acquisition system; (d) recording
    of successful measurements made by the sensors of the environmental variables
    channel. In a third channel of Thingspeak, the measurements made regarding the
    nutrient solution and the evolution of the crop are saved (Figure 8), considering
    the: (a) pH, (b) EC, (c) fresh weight, (d) length and (e) width of the leaf. Figure
    8. Manual register of variables in nutrient solution and crop. (a) pH; (b) EC;
    (c) fresh weight; (d) leaf length; (e) leaf width. Figure 9 shows each of the
    visualizations generated from Table 3; visualizations are obtained by request
    from the Aeroponics Monitor app to Thingspeak: (a) relative temperature and humidity
    in the environment, (b) relative temperature and humidity in the crop, (c) temperature
    difference between crop and environment and its classification regarding the detection
    of water stress, (d) temperature and humidity against VPD, (e) temperature in
    the recirculating and main tank, (f) luminosity, (g) monitoring of level, irrigation
    and recirculation system activation, (h) image acquisition system activation and
    its classification against failures, (i) pH, EC indicators of nutrient solution
    readjustment, (j) crop evolution, (k) report of successful sensor readings/h,
    (l) requests sent to the server per hour and (m) total requests sent to the server
    per channel. Figure 9. Reports generated by Thingspeak using MATLAB visualizations.
    (a) Temperature measurement in solution tanks; (b) measurement of temperature
    and relative humidity in crop; (c) crop minus environment; (d) vapor pressure

    of the recirculation tank and performance of irrigation and recirculation systems;
    (h) operation state of the imaging system; (i) parameters in nutrient solution
    pH and EC; (j) crop growth parameters; (k) report of successful readings on sensors
    per hour; (l) reporting of requests sent to the server by hour; (m) reporting
    of requests sent to the server by channel. Graphs (g), (h), (k), (l) and (m) allow
    you to quickly review the operating status of the platform in the app; (g) shows
    the evolution of the level of the solution in the recirculating tank from the
    activation of irrigation and the recirculation pump. Among the main failures that
    can be detected from its review are sprinkler obstruction (increase in period
    or stagnation), irrigation service failure or recirculation (absence of impulse)
    and level sensor failure (frequent reading at 0); (h) shows the state of the image
    acquisition system, or normal operation, and is represented by the appearance
    of the pulse amplitude of 3, while a stagnation in 2 or 1 determines a flaw in
    the upper and frontal chamber, respectively, or the absence of impulse, the failure
    in the camera service; (k) and (l) are complementary indicators; the absence of
    (k) denotes a failure on the sensor service, while the absence of (l) denotes
    an internet connection failure (l); (m) shows the number of requests sent to the
    server per channel as a whole, avoiding crossing the limit of 8200 requests sent
    per day. Finally, Figure 10 shows an image acquired by the image acquisition system
    incorporated in the proposed system. Figure 10. Images acquired by the proposed
    intelligent monitoring system. (a) Lateral view of the crop; (b) top view of the
    crop; (c) RGB image of the root; (d) thermographic image of the root. 4.2. Analysis
    of the Environmental Variables and Image Analysis For the analysis of the environmental
    variables, the database obtained in the period between 1 and 17 November 2021
    was downloaded from Thingspeak. To define water deficiencies due to the modification
    of plant transpiration with reference to climatic variables in the greenhouse,
    VPD was calculated. VPD is defined as the difference between the water vapor pressure
    at saturation (Psat) and the actual water vapor pressure at the temperature of
    the greenhouse [51]. Psat can be calculated from Allen, 1998 [52] as follows 𝑃
    𝑠𝑎𝑡 (𝑇)=0.6108 𝑒    17.27 𝑇 𝑇+237.3 (1) with 𝑉𝑃𝐷= 𝑃 𝑠𝑎𝑡 (𝑇)−( 𝑅𝐻 100 ) 𝑃 𝑠𝑎𝑡 (T)
    (2) where substitution of the leaf temperature and greenhouse temperature in (1)
    results as 𝑉𝑃𝐷=0.6108 𝑒    17.27  𝑇 𝑐 𝑇 𝑐 +237.3 −( 𝑅𝐻 100 )0.6108 𝑒    17.27  𝑇
    𝑎 𝑇 𝑎 +237.3 (3) or expressed as a base 10 exponential form [23,53], approximately
    as 𝑉𝑃𝐷=610.7[ 10 7.5 𝑇 𝑐 𝑇 𝑐 +237.3 −( 𝑅𝐻 100 ) 10 7.5 𝑇 𝑎 𝑇 𝑎 +237.3 ] (4) On
    the other hand, the temperature difference between the crop and leaf is taken
    as 𝐷 𝑇 𝑙𝑎 = 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑎 (5) where 𝑇 𝑐 , 𝑇 𝑎 and RH are the leaf temperature, air
    temperature and relative humidity, respectively. Figure 11 shows the analysis
    of the information downloaded from Thingspeak and processed independently, showing
    the evolution during the 7 days for: (a) environmental temperature, (b) relative
    humidity in environment, (c) crop temperature, (d) difference in crop minus environment
    temperature, (e) luminosity and (f) vapor pressure deficit. Figure 11. Registration
    of environmental variables and markers of water stress. (a) Ambient temperature;
    (b) ambient relative humidity; (c) crop temperature; (d) crop—ambient temperature
    difference; (e) luminosity; (f) vapor pressure deficit. Table 4 describes the
    behavior of each variable with respect to the maximum, minimum, average during
    the 7 days and standard deviation, as well as the time in which the maximum and
    the minimum were determined for each case. Additionally, the behavior of pH, EC,
    fresh weight, length and leaf width were added. Table 4. Analysis of main variables
    in the proposed intelligent monitoring system. Regarding the stress indicators,
    it is observed that the temperature of the leaf slightly exceeds 0 and the difference
    moves away to −4.63 °C when the luminosity is at its maximum point, approximately
    at 12 h, the same time in which the environmental temperature is higher than 25
    °C and the VPD is above 2.5 kPa on most days. According to Amitrano, the crop
    tries to avoid dehydration and water loss by closing its stomata, reducing its
    phosphorus capacity and limiting the growth of the plant [20]. According to the
    information presented, the day with the lowest VPD was fuel day 3, on which, as
    shown in Figure 12, a VPD between 0.5 and 1 kPa developed in two hours: the first
    between 7:00 and 8:30 h when the temperature was between 10 and 20 °C and the
    relative humidity was between 35 and 70%; the second after 19:00 h, when there
    was practically no sunlight and the temperature dropped below 18 °C, while the
    humidity increased above 40%. Figure 12. Favorable conditions for a low VPD. On
    the other hand, according to the images captured with the thermographic camera
    in the root (Figure 10), similarities were found in the colorimetry of the image
    seen from the thermal image, except for day 7, while in the RGB image, slight
    changes in colorimetry were found that were not so distinguishable after the first
    days. From this observation, a system for processing images to highlight the root
    was generated in the RGB and HSV model through the generation of a mask that only
    allows the root to pass and another to eliminate the background, respectively
    (Figure 13). The image processing is generated through the segmentation of the
    H and V components; for H the colors facing the background are segmented (35,140),
    while for V the pixels with high intensity are segmented (100, 255). Once a first
    mask is obtained, the AND operation is performed between the image segmented in
    V and the negative of that segmented in H to pass them through morphological filtering
    with a 2 × 2 kernel, obtaining from this process and its negative the masks for
    the root enhancement and background removal on the RGB and HSV images, respectively.
    Figure 13. Image processing for root enhancement. From the RGB image shown in
    Figure 10 and the processing described above, a tool was developed in the intelligent
    monitoring system to visualize the root with the enhanced image in the RGB and
    HSV model. The result of the masking of the image in each model is presented in
    Figure 14. Figure 14. RGB and HSV images enhanced at root (day 1). (a) Original
    image of the root; (b) enhanced RGB image; (c) enhanced HSV image. Comparing Figure
    14 and Figure 15, the change in tone of the root can be seen darkening due to
    water stress. The darkening of the root is distinguished by the gradual increase
    in reddish tones in the root seen in the HSV model. Figure 15. RGB and HSV images
    enhanced at root (day 7). (a) Original image of the root; (b) enhanced RGB image;
    (c) enhanced HSV image. Relating to the evolution of the yielding of the crop
    referring to the fresh weight, and the length and the width of the leaf, the measurements
    were made using a scale and a standard flexometer. The data were stored on the
    Thingspeak server via the application developed in this study. Figure 16 shows
    a continuous increase in the fresh weight of the crop until reaching a gain of
    16 g on day 18 from its transplant to the aeroponic chamber; likewise the growth
    of the leaf initially increased by 30 mm in the first days and later achieved
    a minimum growth from day 7 to 18. Figure 16. Yield evolution regarding fresh
    weight, leaf length and width in the test plant. 5. Discussion Various studies
    have indicated that decision making to generate the conditions of irrigation in
    IoT architectures take as reference the evapotranspiration, the weather forecast,
    the relative humidity, the irrigation according to the life cycle and the irrigation
    programmed by the user in soil, while in a crop without soil, the variables considered
    for changing the irrigation scheme are the temperature and relative humidity in
    the environment, and the programmed irrigation schemes based on frequency and
    the ignition time. Particularly in aeroponics, between the schemes recently used
    are the variation in atomization times of day/night according to the days of production
    and the time interval when the ambient temperature exceeds 35 °C [14], as well
    as the control of the temperature and humidity in the root chamber between 25
    and 29 °C [40]; however, they do not consider the standard markers of crop water
    needs such as the crop temperature, VPD or water stress index. In the present
    paper, a Batavia lettuce seedling was subjected to observation in the aeroponic
    cultivation chamber from its transplant, preserving the ranges of pH and EC between
    5.5 and 6.5 and 750 and 1100 ppm and with a constant irrigation system every 24
    min day/night with an activation time of 30 s. According to the experimental results,
    the DTla does not provide a specific criterion for the determination of water
    stress in an aeroponic crop; more studies are required on the Batavia lettuce
    variety to estimate the temperature ranges where the DTla serve as a concrete
    marker of water stress. The experimentation in the crop camera that was presented
    shows how the VPD from the beginning marked a potential root damage due to water
    stress. Figure 9 illustrates how a temperature between 10 and 20 °C together with
    a relative humidity above 35% favors the reduction in the VPD. Figure 16 shows,
    in relation to the fresh weight, an increase in VPD reduction. Figure 16 shows,
    in relation to the fresh weight, a consistent increase; however, the leaf size
    presented a reduction in the rate of growth from the first week. The estimation
    of the VPD in conjunction with image processing provides an estimate of the appearance
    and evolution of water stress in aeroponic crops. Among the main actions to evaluate
    against a high VPD and the reduction in the rate of growth of the leaf, is the
    increase in the frequency of irrigation, as well as the incorporation of a system
    that allows the control of external environmental parameters. In the literature
    studied, both conceptual and practices in the development of crops in the soil,
    hydroponics and aeroponics, address the grouping schemes of components that make
    up the stages and connectivity of an IoT architecture. According to the practical
    proposals found in the literature, by using IoT-based technologies to manage irrigation
    conditions and proposals related to aeroponics, in comparison with our proposal,
    the following were found: similarities between layers using IoT architecture and
    functionalities using functional blocks addressed by Boursianis, Roy and Lloret;
    common study variables addressed by Lucero, Jamhari and Belista. According to
    this criterion, the differences are highlighted in Table 5. Table 5. Comparison
    with related studies. As shown, most of the systems consider the measurement of
    environmental variables and, depending on the meteorological data of the case
    to determine the irrigation and monitoring needs, the automated monitoring of
    the nutritional conditions of the nutritive solution. However, the previous studies
    do not consider the monitoring of crop growth from image acquisition and analysis
    systems, nor do they include reports and alerts due to the failure of the electronic
    systems used in the proposal. In the proposal that is presented in this paper,
    there is an application that not only accesses the monitored data regarding the
    crop, but also provides information on the functionality status of the incorporated
    electronic systems, allowing the user to be alert to the maintenance needs of
    electronic elements and software incorporated in the IoT architecture that has
    been presented. This proposal does not yet incorporate the temperature control
    and humidity in the greenhouse; however, the architecture developed presents the
    flexibility to incorporate additional monitoring services and control due to the
    inclusion of a fog node in the proposed IoT architecture. 6. Conclusions and Further
    Studies This article presents an IoT architecture that facilitates the management
    of an aeroponic greenhouse through the registration of manual procedures, the
    automation of the irrigation system and the monitoring of environmental variables
    in cultivation; all this with the support of a visualization tool from an app.
    The estimation of the VPD indicates the appearance of water stress due to the
    insufficient absorption of crop water. This suggests the importance of making
    an adaptation to the atomization times and the intervals of the times of irrigation,
    as well as the cooling and ventilation systems. The main contribution of this
    paper is the integration of smart sensors, in a technological solution based on
    IoT, that allows the study of the favorable conditions for the growth of aeroponic
    crops with remote management. The app developed for this purpose allows the visualization
    of historical variables of temperature and relative humidity in the environment
    and crops, VPD and luminosity, as well as the level and temperature of the nutrient
    solution tanks to carry out the adjustment of pH and EC. The proposed architecture
    allows the incorporation of monitoring and image processing systems that will
    enrich the studies of the thermography and morphology of the aeroponic crops for
    roots and leaves. Additionally, the proposed architecture manages the heterogeneity
    of data through microservices and allows us to reduce latency in the communication
    with the server using, as a basis, a waiting interval time of 30 s between each
    writing of data on the server, as well as by using a reduced bandwidth to view
    the results of image processing remotely, by a request to the server and downloading
    it from the app. The use of the proposed architecture will allow the study of
    the variation in irrigation schemes based on markers such as VPD, CWSI and DTla,
    favoring the rapid adaptation of irrigation strategies to produce crops with a
    higher number of leaves, leaf area index and fresh weight among others. As future
    work, the proposed architecture for aeroponic crop production will be implemented,
    monitoring the growth chambers simultaneously, and considering the irrigation
    frequency and the time interval as study variables, as well as the decrease in
    VPD in the aeroponic crop process. With regard to the image processing-embedded
    algorithms on fog layer, for the study of colorimetry, infrared thermography and
    morphology in the evolution of the crop when considering the leaf and root will
    be added. Author Contributions Conceptualization, H.A.M.-G. and J.J.M.-N.; Methodology,

  description: In view of the low efficiency of agricultural production and the serious
    waste of agricultural water in our country, an intelligent irrigation system based
    on I.STM neural network was designed.The system used raspberry pie as the lower
    machine controller and Ali cloud server as the upper computer.The grey correlation
    analysis method was used to determine that the correlation coefficients lie twee
    n average air temperature, solar radiation, sunshine hours, average wind speed,
    relative humidity, pressure and crop water demand, which were 0.636 52, 0.510
    42, 0.444 56, 0.440 29, 0.343 50 and 0.287 87 respectively.The meteorological
    factors with large correlation coefficient were selected as the characteristic
    input vector of the I.STM prediction model, and the crop water demand was used
    as the output vector, I.STM neural network prediction model was constructed.Meanwhile,
    the corresponding Internet of Things platform and mobile platform for the system
    was developed, which achieved data visualization and switch remote control functions.The
    results showed that the fitting coefficient R~ of the prediction model was equal
    to 0.987 2, the residual was relatively stable and the prediction accuracy was
    high.In the actual irrigation experiment, the average absolute error of the model
    prediction was 3.02%.The system runs stably and has a high degree of intelligence,
    which provides a certain reference for the development of agricultural modernization.

  description: In this paper, an intelligent greenhouse visualization system based
    on wireless sensor network technology is designed to meet the monitoring needs
    of intelligent greenhouse. The system uses PLC as the main controller and Zigbee
    wireless network to collect the data of intelligent greenhouse environment. The
    intelligent greenhouse visual monitoring system can detect the environmental parameters
    in the greenhouse intelligently, and upload the collected data to the One NET
    cloud platform according to the MQTT protocol. The system will summarize, display,
    record the data and automatically set the light control, fertilization, irrigation
    and other operations. Make the traditional extensive production into modern fine
    farming. Further expand agricultural functions, integrate resources, and build

    Karnataka, India Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction With the development
    of agricultural refinement and industrialization, the demand for agricultural
    facilities is increasing. As an important means of crop cultivation, the research
    and application of agricultural greenhouse are more urgent. In our reality of
    greenhouse use, most of the direct introduction is foreign equipment. Since the
    beginning of the design of greenhouse in foreign countries was based on the actual
    conditions in foreign countries, the control system, whether from the control
    model or the executive body, could not well match our agricultural production,
    the price is high, the effect of control is not ideal. In addition, most of the
    self-built traditional greenhouse is still limited in the simple insulation level,
    the level of automation and modernization is very low, which cannot meet the requirements
    of large-scale production of contemporary agriculture. Intelligent, low-cost,
    in line with the actual situation of the greenhouse is urgently needed to be developed
    and designed. In summary, this paper relies on the key technologies of wireless
    sensor network to conduct research on the intelligent visualization monitoring
    system of greenhouse. A good environment is necessary for crops to grow properly.
    Greenhouse environment is closely related to crop growth, development and energy
    exchange. Environmental measurement and control is the basic guarantee to realize
    automatic and intelligent greenhouse production management. Through the analysis
    of monitoring data, combined with the law of crop growth and development to control
    the environmental conditions, can ensure the healthy growth of crops and improve
    the quality of agricultural products. Greenhouse temperature, humidity and soil
    pH parameters, directly related to the growth of crops. And today most of the
    greenhouse temperature, humidity control is manual management, so it is inevitable
    that the measurement and control accuracy is low, high labor intensity and measurement
    and control is not timely, not accurate. The effect of measurement and control
    is easy to cause irreparable losses, not only greatly increase the cost, waste
    of human resources, but also difficult to achieve the expected effect. Therefore,
    the design of “intelligent greenhouse visualization system” is carried out to
    monitor the growth data in real time and regulate the temperature, humidity and
    soil moisture content in the greenhouse scientifically and reasonably. The greenhouse
    is conducive to the formation of vegetables, fruits growth environment, promote
    greenhouse vegetables and fruits early, high quality and efficient production.
    Agricultural IOT collects data such as light intensity, air temperature, soil
    moisture and C02 concentration during crop growth. The smart greenhouse calculates
    the most suitable parameters for crop growth, creating an artificial meteorological
    environment and eliminating the constraints of temperature on biological growth.
    The smart greenhouse overcomes the restriction of environmental parameters on
    plant growth, so that different crops can be produced in seasons that are not
    suitable for growth. Make the season no longer have excessive influence on the
    growth of crops, partly or completely get rid of the dependence of crops on natural
    conditions. Further expand agricultural function, integrate resources. Make crop
    production accurate and controllable. Temperature, humidity, light and other parameters
    are precisely and scientifically controllable, and the environmental coupling
    rate can be effectively controlled, so as to guarantee the quality of agricultural
    products [1]. Finally, the Internet of things technology and the development of
    agricultural production are effectively combined through various controls. Scientifically
    and reasonably adjust the temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content in
    the intelligent greenhouse, so that the formation of an environment conducive
    to crop growth in the intelligent greenhouse. It improves the efficiency of agricultural
    production, the output ratio of unit factor input, and the input-output efficiency.
    SECTION II. Overall Design of Intelligent Greenhouse Monitoring System Firstly,
    according to the actual temperature demand of intelligent greenhouse, the greenhouse
    temperature control model is established. An intelligent greenhouse monitoring
    system based on wireless sensor network is designed. This paper studies a greenhouse
    remote monitoring system based on Zigbee technology [2]. In the design of the
    greenhouse remote monitoring system, Zigbee module and sensor module are used
    to form a wireless sensor node [3], which collects the temperature, humidity and
    other parameters in the covered environment in real time and transmits them to
    the terminal node Zigbee. The data is transmitted to the Zigbee central node,
    and then the environment parameters in the greenhouse can be displayed on the
    designed upper computer. The control center evaluates and analyzes the greenhouse
    environment, and sends out prompt information and commands according to the detected
    greenhouse environment to realize control and monitoring. Fig. 1. Block diagram
    of intelligent greenhouse control system Show All Fig. 2. Block diagram of communication
    network system Show All Fig. 3. Block diagram of intelligent greenhouse control
    system Show All Secondly, analyze the growth factors of greenhouse crops and determine
    the control strategy and control mode of greenhouse control system [4]. According
    to the actual requirements and characteristics of greenhouse production, complete
    the design of the overall structure and hardware of the greenhouse control system,
    including the selection and design of the control host, detection components and
    actuator. Step7-microwin and WinCC V7 are used to solve the problems of PLC programming
    and the development and design of the upper computer control interface. The overall
    design of the greenhouse control system is realized, as shown in Fig. 1 to Fig.
    3. Finally, the temperature, light and wind speed of the internal environment
    of the greenhouse are collected and analyzed to improve some problems in the preliminary
    design. Put forward the optimization scheme for the equipment layout and overall
    framework of the greenhouse and optimize according to the proposed scheme. The
    intelligent greenhouse monitoring system is designed, which is composed of application
    system, network system and perception system. SECTION III. Design of Application
    System A. Hardware Design of Main Control PLC System In order to realize the environment
    real-time monitoring of intelligent greenhouse, this system chooses PLC as the
    main controller of the environment parameter control system. Establish greenhouse
    environment application system to realize real-time monitoring of temperature,
    humidity, CO2 concentration, light intensity and other parameters in smart greenhouse.
    In addition, according to the temperature and humidity changes of the intelligent
    greenhouse, the skylight, side window, cooling wet fan, wet curtain, external
    sunshade net and other equipment can be automatically controlled. The upper computer
    PC uploads greenhouse environmental data to One NET cloud platform following MQTT
    protocol. The One NET cloud platform aggregates, displays, records and automatically
    forms a database. PLC and other intelligent control equipment together, constitute
    a centralized management, decentralized control of distributed control system,
    and realize the greenhouse control equipment automatic setting and remote monitoring.
    In order to ensure the reliability of the system, the greenhouse equipment control
    adopts manual/automatic switching mode. In some special cases the system can be
    switched to manual, to achieve flexible and convenient use, effectively improve
    the greenhouse environment control effect. B. Software Design of Main Control
    PLC System Because there are many environmental factors in the intelligent greenhouse,
    and the coupling of environmental parameters may lead to the disorder of the control
    system, the sequential control method is designed. The system workflow is as follows:
    Self-test PLC power supply and initialize all control parameters. When the PLC
    power supply can work normally without fault, the temperature system will initialize
    and give the set temperature value. Set each parameter of PID operation; initialize
    the parameters of each control part. The information transmission network system
    will transfer the measured parameters in the greenhouse to PLC for processing.
    PLC gradually realizes the comparison of temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration
    and light intensity with the set parameters. Control and adjust each parameter
    in turn. If the measured value is equal to the set value, the original greenhouse
    temperature is maintained. If the measured value is not e qual to the set value,
    then determine whether it is greater than or less than. When the measured value
    is greater than the set value, open the ventilation curtain; when the measured
    value is less than the set value, the heating system is turned on. When the measured
    temperature reaches the set value, the heating system or ventilation curtain is
    turned off. Humidity control also has two modes: automatic and manual. The manual
    control mode is similar to the temperature manual control, and the automatic control
    mode is realized by comparing instructions. The sampling value of the humidity
    sensor is compared with the digital quantity corresponding to the initial set
    value. After comparison, the output module controls the water curtain to achieve
    the purpose of humidity control. C. Functional Design of The control Subsystem
    1) Fan control: The greenhouse is equipped with a fan assembly that can be turned
    on and off. When the temperature exceeds the threshold, to reduce the greenhouse
    temperature, the programmable controller automatically opens the two side Windows
    and starts the fan and wet curtain pump. 2) Side window control: Both side Windows
    are controlled by motor and controlled by position switch. 3) Wet curtain water
    pump control: When the humidity of the greenhouse is below a predetermined value,
    the wet curtain water pump will be started under the control of the programmable
    controller. After reaching the predetermined value, it will automatically close.
    4) Roll curtain control: When the sunlight intensity exceeds the preset, the roll
    curtain will be pulled down under the control of the programmable controller.
    5) CO2 fertilizer control: when CO2 in greenhouse air falls below a specified
    threshold, the CO2 tank valve is opened under the control of a programmable controller
    to replenish the CO2 concentration. 6) Plant growth lamp control: When the greenhouse
    light is below the specified value, the plant growth lamp should be on to supplement
    the light source. Similarly, the system can adjust other environmental parameters
    in the greenhouse by controlling the heating fan, air cooler, sun screen and other
    equipment in the greenhouse. Providing suitable growing environment for planted
    crops can improve the yield and quality of crops and increase the economic added
    value of agricultural products. SECTION IV. Experiment and Results A. Design of
    Network System At present, with the increase of greenhouse area, the type and
    number of sensors that need to be loaded are increasing. The wiring of the monitoring
    device in the greenhouse is difficult, and the transmission line is too long,
    and the signal attenuation is serious in the long-distance transmission process.
    For the above situation, the system adopts the star topology structure and multi-level
    distributed gateway structure [5], and solves the problem by combining ZigBee
    and NB-iot technology [6]. Zigbee technology is a new type of wireless communication
    technology with unified technical indicators, which is applied in short distance
    range and low rate transmission. It has the characteristics of low power consumption,
    low cost, reliable data transmission and large network capacity. Coupled with
    the 2.4 GHz frequency modulation technology of the CC2530 chip, the sensors can
    communicate with each other through the ZigBee protocol. Each greenhouse area
    requires a Zigbee coordinator as a routing node to collect data from each node.
    At the same time, the data is sent to BC95 module through the serial port. The
    cloud platform of the remote control center will receive the data transmission
    of BC95 module through the NB-LOT network. The ZigBee coordinator will also receive
    and forward the command from the control center through the NB-iot network [7].
    Therefore, it avoids the loss caused by long-distance transmission of signals,
    gives full play to the flexible and convenient characteristics of wireless communication
    without wiring, effectively avoids the defects and deficiencies of traditional
    wired methods, and facilitates system expansion to make the coverage area of the
    system more extensive [8]. In this system, Zigbee coordinator is used as the routing
    node and NB-iot module is used as the data forwarding node to realize the function
    of data forwarding between heterogeneous networks. CC2530 and BC95 are connected
    through serial ports. ZStack protocol stack processes ZigBee protocol, and BC95
    module processes NB-iot protocol. The transmission and reception of NB-iot network
    data [9] control the BC95 module by sending AT instructions through the CC2530
    serial port. Zigbee receives data and NB-iot forwards data. Make full use of Zigbee
    wireless data transmission technology and rely on NB-iot communication technology
    in WAN to reduce the difficulty of long-distance network deployment and greatly
    reduce the deployment cost. B. Design of Perception System 1) Sensor Data Transmission
    System: This system obtains the information of greenhouse. The environmental parameter
    information and crop growth information in the greenhouse are collected by Zigbee
    sensor node. ZigBee terminal nodes connect temperature and humidity sensors, PH
    sensors, light intensity sensors and CO2 concentration sensors to realize the
    function of sensing environmental parameter information. 2) Selection of Temperature
    and Humidity Sensor: DHT11 is used as the temperature and humidity sensor. The
    DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor is a temperature and humidity composite
    sensor with calibrated digital signal output. It can be directly connected to
    the I/O port of the SCM without A/D conversion. Using single bus data format,
    it can transmit 40 bits of data at a time, in which the high address binary bit
    is output first. 3) Selection of Light Sensor: In this design, the photosensor
    adopts BH1750FVI photosensor module. It can output digital results without A/D
    conversion, and has industry standard IIC bus communication mode, measuring range
    1-65535Lx, measuring accuracy up to 0.5lx, and low cost. Without any external
    devices, the impact on infrared is very small. C. Experimental Test Situation
    The system designed in this paper runs in the intelligent greenhouse of the engineering
    research center. The system collects and calculates the environmental parameters
    every 10 minutes. The whole system has been running for about 1 year, and the
    data collection effect is good. The data collection of illumination, soil temperature
    and soil moisture in two different time periods on April 24 and 25, 2022 are listed,
    as shown in the table I below. Table I Experimental Data Table SECTION V. Conclusion
    This paper uses Zigbee and NB-iot data transmission technology and PLC technology
    for hardware design. The visual intelligent greenhouse monitoring system can detect
    the environmental parameters in the greenhouse intelligently. According to the
    upper and lower limits of environmental data of the elements in the shed [10],
    the optimal operation of fertilization, irrigation, light control and humidification
    is set. Make the traditional extensive production into fine farming. Effectively
    integrate technical and humanistic elements into agricultural production, further
    expand agricultural functions and integrate resources. We will develop traditional
    agriculture into a modern greenhouse integrating production and life. Of course,
    due to limited time and knowledge, system automation and system equipment deployment
    can still be further optimized. The visual intelligent greenhouse system designed
    in this paper uses wireless sensor network technology and PLC technology. This
    paper analyzes the hardware and software of the system. The system consists of
    host computer, PLC, environment sensor and control deployment equipment. In order
    to solve the small coverage area of wired network, the wireless information transmission
    network system by NB-iot and Zigbee is adopted to increase the flexibility of
    the communication network. And the cost of installation and maintenance will be
    greatly reduced. Each sensor detects the temperature, humidity and other parameters
    in the greenhouse in real time, which is sent to PLC through A/D converter to
    complete data collection. Using PLC as the main controller, PC and configuration
    software as the monitoring module, they communicate through the serial port to
    control the system equipment, realize the process of intelligence, visualization.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bhubaneswar, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture is a vital area of development in Odisha and has a big influence on
    the state''s economic growth. Many individuals in today''s society are using technology
    to its fullest extent, which helps them do their work quickly and effectively.
    Many farmers in rural areas are still unable to utilise technology more. Additionally,
    as the world''s population grows, so does the need for food supplies. When that
    happens, IoT often develops specialised agricultural techniques to increase food
    production. Farmers may also learn useful information about the requirements of
    the soil, moisture levels, and other subjects. We are setting up this cutting-edge
    farming system for them as a result. This method may be used by farmers to monitor
    their fields'' temperatures, humidity levels, and soil moisture levels. This is
    accomplished via managing a number of additional components, such as motors, as
    well as a range of IOT sensors, such as Temperature, humidity and soil moisture
    sensors. This system is really easy to use and runs purely on wireless technology.
    The transmitter module must be placed in various locations across the farmer''s
    field, and the receiver must be installed in the farmer''s residence and linked
    to the server. The agriculturalist may practice a website or mobile application
    to monitor and manage the system. Odisha offers excellent agricultural and forestry
    production prospects because of the nation''s varied climates and its stringent
    quality and safety regulations [1]. Small, medium, and big farms in agriculture
    may be classified [2]. In accordance with the National Agriculture and Livestock
    Census of 2007, 12.4% of farms are large, 19% are medium-sized, and 68.6% are
    very small. A framework for the upcoming growth of cultivation has been developed
    by the Ministry of Agriculture, focusing on four important criteria: associativity,
    rural development, sustainability, and modernisation of operations [1]. India''s
    economy depends heavily on agriculture, although technology is still not widely
    used in this sector [3]. The major goal of this study is to better understand
    how IoT technology may be used in agricultural farms to modernise its operations
    and benefit the management and productivity. For many agricultural applications,
    cutting-edge cyber systems and digital-twins are being created by fusing together
    contemporary sensor, connection, big data, IoT, and artificial intelligence technologies
    [4]. Applications for agriculture include live plants and trees, agricultural
    goods, agricultural lands and farms, agricultural structures, and agricultural
    equipment. With the use of these tools, stakeholders and farmers will be able
    to more effectively monitor, manage, and coordinate everyday agricultural activities
    from a distance. In order to facilitate integration of a sizable number of sensor
    nodes, equipment, and devices this study concentrates on the networking difficulties
    of the large-scale farms in Odisha. Due to low power consumption of the battery-powered
    devices, long range (LoRa) technology is a possible contender in offering long
    range communication across many kilometres. The major goal of this programme is
    to build an IoT based infrastructure for remotely monitoring the vast agricultural
    areas. The created system (hardware and software) can assess a range of real time
    soil condition parameters for two fruit species, including blueberries and avocados,
    and enables real time monitoring of the labour activities of both humans and machines
    during harvesting of crops. The newly created prototype provides a cheap way to
    get real time data. The article contributes in outlining a customizable hardware
    and software architecture based on LoRa WAn technology that is intended for monitoring
    agricultural fields of various sizes. Although comparable methods have been used
    in prior research, such studies either concentrate on certain applications or
    assess the technical characteristics of particular IoT stack levels. SECTION II.
    Literature Survey Over the last several years, researchers have shown a lot of
    interest in wireless sensor networks (WSN), smart agriculture, and LoRa technologies.
    Several research used ZigBee and other WSN technologies for field data monitoring.
    The relevant research on smart agriculture and WSN that has been conducted by
    different researchers is briefly reviewed in this chapter. Due to the huge demands
    of food created by the growing world''s population, one of the biggest food industries
    in the world and one of the most significant economic sectors in many countries
    is agriculture because of the continuous increase in food consumption, so it is
    crucial to maximise food production while minimising food losses and costs. More
    businesses and organisations are taking interest in creating unique solutions
    that would allow remote monitoring and control to increase agricultural output
    as IoT technology advances. A promising technology called the IoT has several
    opportunities to support a number of new services and applications in a range
    of sectors, including smart agriculture and smart industry [5]–[9]. For the years
    2008 to 2015, the authors of [5] examined IoT applications in the agroindustrial
    and environmental sectors, identifying trends, designs, and outstanding issues.
    These application domains included logistics, monitoring, and control. The authors
    of [6] provide an in-depth analysis of the most recent developments in network
    designs, technologies, and protocols of the Internet of Things in agriculture.
    Additionally, research problems and agricultural regulations for standardisation
    of IoT based agriculture have been considered. The developers of [7] created a
    tool called “FarmFox” to track the health of the soil. The system makes use of
    the TCP protocol and the REST API. Based on WiFi technology, the created sensor
    node keeps track of a number of soil characteristics, including Temperature, soil
    moisture, pH, and turbidity, and transmits the sensor data to the user. The authors
    of [8] provide an assessment of future smart agricultural applications of LoRa
    W An, including autonomous irrigation systems, small- and large-scale farming,
    cattle and animal welfare, and also greenhouse or indoor horticulture. The essay
    emphasises technology limitations and possible future study fields while discussing
    the core applications of LoRa W An for smart farming. The author of [9] looks
    at several IoT application options for farming and agricultural applications as
    well as associated issues. There have been several case studies given and looked
    at, including ones involving hardware platforms, cloud services, and communication
    networks [10]. Furthermore, several factors, including coverage, expense, ratio
    of data transfer, energy use, throughput, and collisions, should be considered
    while creating agricultural apps and services. These are the primary contributions
    of this work: To make a suggestion for an IoT based platform for remote farm monitoring.
    The suggested architecture''s four levels are sensor and application layer, communication
    network layer, and actuator layer. They make up the suggested architecture''s
    four levels. to create a simulation model for a large-scale farm''s LoRa-based
    communication network that enables field monitoring of various sensor nodes and
    measuring equipment remotely. To create a LoRa-based platform that enables LoRa
    tracking and provides real time soil and environmental monitoring, then prototype
    it and put it into use. SECTION III. System Modelling and Architecture Fig. 1.
    The key components of the lora-based network architecture for smart farms Show
    All A LoRa-based architecture''s communication network typically consists of a
    hierarchical structure made by LoRa nodes connected via gateways. The architecture
    consists of network servers, application servers, LoRa nodes, and LoRa gateways.
    Despite not being connected, any gateway that is within range of the LoRa node
    may receive messages. Processing incoming packets, removing duplicates, and distributing
    the data to the application servers are all the responsibilities of the central
    network server. The key components of the LoRa-based network architecture for
    smart farms are shown in Figure 1. Through connection with gateways, LoRa sensor
    nodes are in charge of gathering, sensing the data or controlling actions (actuators).
    Internet connected LoRa gateways are in charge of receiving and transferring data
    from and to various LoRa sensors and actuator nodes. The LoRa Network Server is
    in charge of overseeing LoRa gateway management and controlling the duplication
    of received data. Additionally, it is in charge of planning and scheduling the
    transmission of data and acknowledgements for certain nodes. The LoRa W An Application
    Server is in charge of managing the LoRa W An application layer, including data
    encoding and decoding for the downlink and uplink, as well as encryption and decryption.
    Fig. 2. The internal architecture of the lora soil moisture sensor Show All The
    Atmel Atmega328P-based Lora soil moisture sensor collects local air temperature
    and humidity using the sensor AHT10, detects soil humidity using a capacitor-humility
    measurement solution using the 555, and transmits the local environmental data
    to the gateway using Lora communication, making it suitable for use in irrigation,
    agriculture, smart farms, and other IoT applications. The internal architecture
    of the Lora soil moisture sensor is shown in Fig. 2. In applications, testing
    the air and soil conditions for a few seconds followed by minutes or hours of
    sleep is usually sufficient for the majority of projects. Therefore, they can
    only be switched on for a brief period of time before being turned off for an
    extended period of time. This is done to save energy. This module operates properly
    with two AAA batteries for months while the MCU is in sleep mode. Additionally,
    this sensor has a waterproof paint coating that extends its operating window in
    soggy soil. The Lora temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors are pre-programmed
    with an Arduino pro-mini bootloader and a default code. Users may reprogram it
    using the Arduino IDE; for this, we advise using a common USB to UART converter.
    In order to download an Arduino sketch, the DTR in the USB2UART converter must
    be connected to the “Reset” pin; otherwise, the reset button has been pressed
    manually. There are three operating frequency options available for the Lora Soil
    Moisture Sensor, with bandwidth options ranging from 7.8125 kHz to 500 kHz and
    spreading factors ranging from 6 to 12. The interface function of the Lora soil
    moisture sensor is depicted in Figure 3. Fig. 3. The interface function of the
    lora soil moisture sensor Show All Based on the Arduino, the Lora Soil Moisture
    Sensor may be easily programmed by non-programmers using the Arduino IDE. Additionally,
    there are instructions for users on how to build their first IoT project using
    this board, allowing beginners to pick up hardware and programming skills rapidly.
    This moisture sensor may be used to determine if there is water nearby or how
    wet the soil is. Simply place it in the ground and have an analogue reader read
    it, and it can be used very easily. With the help of this module, it can be used
    very easily. will be possible to have the plant remind you: “Hey, I''m thirsty
    right now; I need some water.” Based on the capacitive concept, we combined the
    capacitance measurement from the 555 oscillators, which will give you a value
    between 500 (very moist) and 1000 (very dry). Fig. 4. The node circuit''s schematic
    diagram of the lora soil moisture sensor Show All The nodes are deployed in an
    indoor setting for gathering various monitoring metrics. Fig. 4. displays the
    node circuit''s schematic diagram. Lora Soil Moisture uses capacitive sensing
    to monitor moisture in the soil. Moist soil works as an electrolyte, raising the
    capacitance of some improvised capacitors constructed from a few traces on a PCB.
    According to the design, the chip outputs a 2MHz square wave via a resistor onto
    a large pad, which when combined with the surrounding ground creates a parasitic
    capacitor called C 1. A low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency that varies with
    capacitance is created by the resistor R23 and capacitor C 1. By examining the
    final voltage on the R9, we may determine the soil moisture condition since the
    capacitance of C 1 varies when the soil moisture fluctuates. The capacitance of
    our improvised capacitor also varies according to the quantity of moisture in
    the soil around the sensor, which serves as an electrolyte. The filtered square
    wave is routed into a peak detector made of a capacitor (C5) and a diode (D2),
    which allows positive peaks to pass while storing their maximum voltage, which
    is measured by ADC in the microcontroller. SECTION IV. Results and Discussion
    A LoRa WAn server has been set up on TTN (The Things Network) stack to receive
    monitoring data from LoRa sensor nodes and display it on ThingSpeak Platform,
    which is how the whole system architecture is shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig.
    6, the recorded data in ThingSpeak platform includes ADC, soil temperature, soil
    humidity, and air humidity. Fig. 5. System architecture of the proposed system.
    Show All Fig. 6. The recorded data in thingspeak platform includes adc, soil temperature,
    and air humidity. Show All Due to their ability to enable a variety of applications
    in large-scale agricultural fields, IoT and LoRa technology applications have
    attracted a lot of attention. The power consumption test of the LoRa soil moisture
    sensor has been illustrated in Fig. 7. Two batteries are required for the module
    to track the soil''s temperature and humidity over the course of a month in the
    flower pots. It has been kept track of how long it took from the start of the
    test until the battery ran out. The results of hardware and software platforms,
    which are aimed at vast and large farms, were presented in this study. In order
    to offer broader coverage, the platform overcomes the difficulties of existing
    solutions, including hardware and services. The suggested data of communication
    between sensor nodes, LoRa gateways, and the network server for practical applications
    has been shown. Fig. 7. The power consumption test of the lora soil moisture sensor
    Show All SECTION V. Conclusions In the proposed work, a unique LoRa-based platform
    was developed that provides a low-cost way to monitor several applications in
    large-scale agricultural fields in real-time, including LoRa tracking and monitoring
    atmospheric and soil data. The four tiers of the proposed IoT architecture are
    the sensors and actuators, communication networks, application, and farm perception
    layers. The recommended solution complies with the requirements for large-scale
    agricultural fields by using LoRa W An for low power wide area network (LPW AN)
    data transfer. The system was tested using both simulation and an actual prototype.
    The Things Network (TTN) platform then receives data from various different sensor
    nodes via the LoRA W An Gateways. The TTN platform is in charge of gathering data,
    structuring it, and rerouting it to the ThingSpeak platform for data analysis,
    visualisation, and storage. For different data analytics programmes, the incoming
    data opens up new possibilities, enabling real time data processing and a variety
    of forecasting services for farm management. We are now working to create actuator
    nodes for various agricultural activities to be automated and controlled. Nodes
    of sensor and actuator technology will be put in various real-world settings,
    such as rural areas. Although the work in this area was concentrated on large-scale
    farms, it might be applicable to other smart grid and smart city applications
    with comparable needs. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    IEEE Conference Location: Bangalore, India SECTION I. Introduction The notion
    of Internet of Things (IoT) defines how a network of distinct physical items that
    are integrated with sensors, software, and other technologies operate together
    for the goal of connecting and sharing data with other devices and systems through
    the internet. Agriculture is one of the oldest forms of human task to be established
    from the prehistoric era. Agriculture is the cultivation of plants and livestock,
    and is an integral part of every country for their economy and existence. India
    is one of the world''s foremost exporters of agricultural products. Agriculture
    exports in 2021-22 increased by 19.92 percent from US 41.87billionin2020−21toUS
    50 billion in 2021-22 as per the records set by DGCI&S (Directorate General of
    Commercial Intelligence and Statistics). While technology evolves, the agricultural
    sector still follows ad-hoc procedures and is yet to be digitized. This paves
    way for technology to help and support farmers perform their tasks smartly and
    help them focus on tasks that require human intervention. In the current day era,
    the use of digital technology is discerning in every walk of life from grocery
    shops to industrial manufacturing plants. But, there has been a very slow inclusion
    of it into the domain of agriculture. In a field of work which could see a revolutionizing
    developments in the domain of work. During the research, it was found that even
    though a few IoT solutions exist for smart-farming, a vast majority of farmers
    tend to not rely on them. There are several reasons for this, including the expenses
    of installing and maintaining such systems, lack of technical know-how to operate
    some IoT based devices, the fact that most farmers are used to primitive methods
    and unwilling to change them, etc. Hence, this manifests to be the most pivotal
    phase, which could easily become a hindrance in the use of the technology. Piloting
    towards the necessity of training farmers to become familiar with relevant technology,
    alongside making them aware of the merits of inculcation of it. In the paper,
    we discuss the related theoretical study that has been accomplished following
    the established existing models that have been achieved. And further we provide
    the proposed system and methodology used to achieve it. It has been attempted
    to implement Iot technologies incorporating precision farming and robots in order
    to assist producers in reducing their on-farm time and focusing on activities
    that require human participation. SECTION II. Related Work As the scope of wants
    of technology in agriculture goes on developing in the market in an ever increasing
    method, the technique of resolving them grows difficult. In [1], they explore
    how Agriculture is one of the most important components of human life. They focussed
    on seed planting operations in this research and aimed to fix the problem. They
    employed battery-powered wheels with a built-in dc motor in the seed sowing machine
    system, and an Arduino Uno to drive the full system. It detects the quantity of
    stored seed and alerts through an LED when the seeds are empty. In summary, seeds
    fall from this seed drum with each whole turn of the rotating wheel, and the seed
    planter operation runs smoothly and without seed waste. In [2] they aim to use
    the existing method to the project to construct a machine that utilizes solar
    energy to power the robotic machine in order to cut operating expenses and time
    for digging and seed sowing tasks. In order to limit labor reliance even more,
    infrared sensors are deployed to operate robots in the field. They carry out their
    usual agricultural duties while saving fuel to a bigger extent. At the same time,
    harnessing solar energy may aid in reducing pollution in the environment. This
    helps conserve money as well as avoid using fossil fuel. They want to replace
    a troublesome gear system with a hall effect sensor for easier and less expensive
    seed planting and to eliminate the need for workers in [3]. Innovative seed sowing
    equipment has a significant impact on agriculture. By utilizing this unique seed
    sowing technology, we can save more time during the sowing process and lower labor
    costs. They want to build and produce a smart seed planting robot for the aforementioned
    duty in [4]. In this smart robot, one robotic arm is used to disseminate seeds
    from the seeds container. The smartphone application is used to control the robot
    arm and obtain the essential locations. When the switch is turned on, the arm
    automatically sows the seed when all of the spots have been recognised. The smartphone
    app may also be used to operate the robot''s wheel. As a result, this technique
    uses a well-designed mechanical system to completely automate the seed-planting
    process. By reducing the amount of work and overall cost of planting seeds, this
    robot saves time and money. They devised a framework based on unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) in [5], which may be used to create a circuit for precision agriculture
    in which UAVs are in charge of seed planting on the farm. The input collected
    from the wireless sensor network (WSN) guides the application approach (WSN).
    The goal of this project is to allow for short control loop delays so that the
    seed-sowing UAV can examine sensor data. The authors of [6] hope to develop a
    seed-sowing quadcopter payload capable of disseminating seeds in woods and along
    road edges. Waypoints are also recorded in target fields and relayed to the Pixhawk
    Flight Controller using the Mission planner. The Pixhawk, which is linked to the
    UAV and manages the flow of seeds to the required locations, controls the seed
    dispenser. As a consequence, the seed sowing quadcopter is designed and tested
    in a semi-automated manner, significantly reducing human labor. They created a
    system in [7] that would continuously monitor the farmland while also performing
    live video streaming for watching the agricultural field from the system itself,
    and use a Raspberry Pi camera. The recommended solution in [8] automates this
    system by linking it to its centralized computer system utilizing the concept
    of IOT. Pest management is also included in the recommended strategy. The irrigation
    node in [9] this system is made up of a LoRa communication module, a solenoid
    valve, and a hydropower generator. Using LoRa gateways, the irrigation node transmits
    data to clouds through wireless transmission. Mobile applications may be used
    to administer the system remotely. Smart Irrigation System (SIS) turns the engine
    ON/OFF automatically by detecting the moisture level. [11] uses Random Forest
    to differentiate between healthy and ill leaves using the data sets supplied to
    deal with the issues they face. The proposed research includes many steps of implementation,
    including dataset building, feature extraction, classifier training, and classification.
    [12] discusses a study that used Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) classifiers
    to diagnose plant illnesses using visual signs on leaves. A digital camera is
    used to capture images of healthy and ill leaf samples, which are then enhanced
    and segmented to locate diseased portions. Active contour models are used for
    picture segmentation in [13], and Hu''s moments are extracted as features for
    adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system training. The study in [14] looked at a
    variety of computer vision methodologies and came up with an algorithm that contains
    four main phases: identification, feature extraction, image classification, and
    classifier performance evaluation. They propose an SVM-based Multiple Classifier
    System (MCS) for wheat leaf disease pattern recognition in [15]. To combine the
    classification judgements produced from three kinds of support vector machines
    (SVMs)-based classifiers, the proposed technique uses layered generalization structures.
    Color characteristics, texture features, and shape traits are among the three
    distinct feature sets. [16] provides an overview of methods for identifying, measuring,
    and categorizing plant diseases using digital pictures in the visible spectrum
    utilizing digital image processing techniques. Using Random Forest and GLCMfeatures,
    the proposed method gets the maximum classification accuracy of 86 percent in
    [17]. They propose a method for identifying plants using leaf photos in [18].
    To differentiate plant types, shape and color data from leaf pictures are used
    using k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest
    classification methods. The proposed approach is tested with 1897 leaf photographs
    and 32 different leaf kinds. When both form and coloring data are added in the
    Random Forest technique, the rate of success of plant classification may be increased
    up to 96 percent, according to the results. SECTION III. Existing System There
    are a variety of existing systems which try to implement sections of the proposed
    module of implementation. Some of these already exist, to name a few: Nevon Automatic
    Seed Sowing Robot, Cloud Farmer and OneSoil Scouting. From securing seeds and
    harboring the containment of seeds. Deriving from the AgRecord’s Cloud Farmer
    software they have all these available on cloud for access from every part of
    the world. The simplicity and farmer friendly design of the Cloud Farmer App will
    change the way farmers manage the day to day operation of the farm. It has been
    a valuable tool for monitoring and defining irrigation. Deficiencies are visible
    and irrigation blocks have been rearranged according to NDVI (Normalized difference
    vegetation index) and contrasted NDVI, previously identified soil differences
    within a field have been confirmed. Using Fasal sensors, farmers were able to
    save up to 30–50% of their irrigation water usage, reduce their spraying cost
    up to 25–30%, and increase their yield up to 15–25%. Fasal has contributed immensely
    to the lives of horticulture farmers in India to optimize the use of resources
    and improve the quality and quantity of crops with smart farming. Fasal simply
    put, is the technology through which crops converse with the farmers in terms
    of what they need and when they need it. We leverage technologies like IoT (Internet
    of Things) that track micro and macro climatic data like canopy temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, rainfall etc and also track soil moisture, crop stage, crop growth
    characteristics to provide valuable information to the farmer like disease and
    pest risks, farm-level climate risk, irrigation requirements, fertigation requirements,
    optimum pesticide spray timing etc. We also found out that most of the IoT solutions
    that farmers use and rely on are actually not remotely operable. They require
    on premise human intervention in order to produce results to the expected extent.
    This motivated us to think of an IoT based smart-farming solution that requires
    less resources than existing systems do and can also be controlled and monitored
    remotely. With this in mind, we are building a smart-farming solution with these
    desired qualities. The systems mentioned earlier, all these systems work in silo
    i.e. Independently. This is a major cause of inefficiency. Hence, we saw this
    as an issue that could be solved and have hereby proposed our solution to this
    prevalent problem in the agricultural sector. SECTION IV. Proposed System Our
    proposed system has 2 main components, precision farming utilities and a multipurpose
    farming robot. Precision farming utilities include incorporating IoT sensors to
    get readings of metrics such as soil moisture level which are then made remotely
    accessible to the farmer. We have seen a seed sowing machine in the existing systems
    section. However, seeding is done at most a few times a year and the device stays
    unused the rest of the time. This has inspired us to build a Multipurpose Farming
    Robot. It has a fixed chassis that is IoT operated, the necessary IoT/hardware
    components, and the ability to work together with a number of separate modules
    that are built for various purposes. For example, we can pair up this robot with
    a seeding module to make it work like an IoT based seed sowing device. However,
    we also have the option to remove the seeing module and attach a module that serves
    precision farming data collection purposes. By pairing the robot with a soil moisture
    sensing module, we can have it travel the fields collecting soil moisture data
    for us. This way, we can obtain readings from multiple locations without having
    to install multiple sensors which helps to reduce costs drastically. We can also
    swap this with an Arducam module to capture images that can be used for disease
    prediction. This IoT robot will also provide feedback to the farmer that can be
    accessed remotely. SECTION V. Methodology The overall design of the project revolves
    around an automatic seeding machine which can be used to perform multiple functionalities.
    The process of building our robot has been divided into the following steps. Building
    basic IoT setup to collect data that aids precision farming which includes Soil
    moisture sensing, DHT11 (Atmospheric Humidity and Temperature), Arducam (imaging
    for disease prediction) etc. Building a dashboard to collect data from individual
    sensing units and visualizing them Building a standalone robot that can maneuver
    through the fields Converting our setups (mechanical, like seeding, as well as
    IoT based, like soil moisture) into modules that pair seamlessly with the robot
    Integrate the modules to work together with the robot and apply finishing touches
    on the visualization aspect. Fig 9.1: Workflow of model Show All Step 1: Building
    a basic IoT setup The IoT setup comprises various swappable components. Some of
    the functionalities include: Soil moisture sensing using a capacitive soil moisture
    sensor for irrigation assistance Using a DHT11 sensor for atmospheric humidity
    and temperature readings Arducam to capture images for disease prediction. Fig.
    9.2: Use of IoT Components Show All Step 2: Building a dashboard A dashboard will
    be used to present the information being collected from the sensors as mentioned
    in the previous step. This will then be visualized so that farmers can understand
    and comprehend figures easily as less knowledge is required. A simple solution
    using the Blynk app will suffice initially to test the functionalities of individual
    sensing units. Going forward, a custom dashboard will be built so as to integrate
    and streamline the various processes involved. Fig 9.3: Dashboard and its applications
    Show All Step 3: Building a Robot We build a multipurpose agricultural robot.
    The chassis will be based on the seed sowing robot that we saw earlier, however
    it will be remotely controlled using IoT components. This will be a bare-bones
    robot capable of maneuvering around fields and does not serve an immediate use
    as a farming tool. The robot will have enough overhead space to fit various modules
    that are used to carry out farming tasks and collect data for precision farming.
    Step 4: Building modules that work with the robot We build modules that we can
    attach to the robot. We build the seeding machine’s mechanical components and
    put it together into one module We take the other IoT based setups from step 1
    and convert them into modules as well These modules carry out their respective
    tasks while staying latched onto the robot, making it multipurpose Step 5: Integrating
    the modules and Finishing touches There are some other considerations that come
    into picture here. For example, we cannot just drag a soil moisture sensor through
    the ground. We take such considerations into account here to solve them. For example,
    the above problem can be solved by incorporating an insertion/extraction mechanism
    for them. Finally, we the finishing touches to our project (like integrating dashboard
    components) as necessary SECTION VI. Conclusion Agriculture is an ever growing
    sector of research and development that would require constant updating of existing
    practices to be replaced by the newer and more efficient ways of achieving the
    task. With the help of the rapid developing digital technologies from Cloud to
    Internet of Things, the field of agriculture is due for a coherent way of harnessing
    the offerings of the technologies. And the proposed methodology most precisely
    coincides with this kind of advancements that are required for the growth of agriculture
    and farming techniques, in scope of precision farming. Further hope of development
    could be possibly seen in the complete automation process of agriculture from
    the very beginning process of churning the land to the final selling of the harvest,
    from the farmers point of view. SECTION VII. Future Scope The formerly offered
    methodology may be further refined by integrating new kinds of data or elements
    that would have a function to play in the prediction of optimal types of agricultural
    practices. Making use of additional modern technology in addition to these can
    demonstrate to be very practicable and useful. Harnessing the ideas of edge computing
    in AI- driven smart agriculture practices. Authors Figures References Keywords

    areas to boost agricultural productivity. 1. Introduction According to the United
    States Census Bureau, the current universal population is estimated to be around
    7.6 billion people, up from 7.2 billion people in 2015 [ 1, 2]. The world’s population
    is anticipated to reach about 10 billion persons by 2050 [ 3, 4]. To keep up with
    the exponential population growth, the “United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO)” report predicted that global food production would need to increase by
    virtually 70% in 2050 compared to that of 2006 [ 3, 4]. Africa’s population will
    geometrically raise to about 2.5 billion by 2050, from its current 1.2 billion
    in 2015 [ 1, 2]. Undoubtedly, there is going to be a shortage of food owing to
    the enormously increasing population. Therefore, it is crucial to continuously
    develop and explore innovative agricultural techniques [ 3– 12]. The importance
    of a smart irrigation system (SIS) as well as the issue dealing with water efficiency
    in agriculture productivity comes into focus here because of the pressing need
    to consistently increase agricultural productivity levels [ 13– 17]. Irrigation
    can be described as the process of supplying water to land to enable plants to
    grow. Water bodies are channelled through canals, ditches, pipes, or natural streams.
    According to Bjorneberg [ 18], over the years, different irrigation techniques
    have been in practice to satisfy the irrigation requirements for positive crop
    growth in certain areas. The three foremost techniques of irrigation are, namely,
    drip/micro, surface, and sprinkler [ 19, 20]. Water flows over the soil (land)
    for surface irrigation. Sprinkler irrigation supplies water to crops by sprinkling
    or spraying water from moving or fixed systems. Micro-irrigation supplies water
    with frequent, small applications, usually wetting a portion of the field. Another
    minor irrigation technique is the subirrigation method. Here, the water level
    is raised to or held near the crop root zone employing ditches or subsurface drains
    to supply the water. Nigeria’s irrigation capacity ranges from 1.5 to 3.2 million
    hectares. According to recent estimates, there are approximately 2.3 million hectares
    in total, with over 1 million hectares in the north [ 21]. Only about 40% of the
    142–106 hectares irrigated by public schemes are actually accurately irrigated
    [ 21]; 32% for irrigated areas managed or controlled by the River Basin Development
    Authorities (RBDAs) and 55% for those managed or controlled by states [ 21]. This
    low rate can be attributed to the need for rehabilitation in most schemes—which
    accounts for 80% of the equipped area; high operation, upkeep, and maintenance
    costs; fuel shortages; or technical weakening of infrastructure and pumps. On
    the other hand, some known irrigation methods have the disadvantages of high labour
    costs, the cost of setting up an irrigation project and system, poor water management
    and control, erosion, water runoff and percolation losses, spot top and fixture
    costs, not appropriate for odd-shaped comedians, potential wander and evaporation
    losses, and waterlogging, which can lead to mosquito breeding and other parasites
    [ 22]. According to Penchalaiah et al. [ 23], farmers estimated the maturity of
    the land and reserves to create revenue in ancient times. A farmer’s life is becoming
    increasingly challenging due to reduced humidity levels, water levels, and specific
    climatic circumstances. The wireless sensor network (WSN) is made up of sensor
    nodes that can detect, communicate with computers, and communicate wirelessly
    [ 24]. The field uses WSN technology to manage and monitor the environment and
    soil conditions. WSNs are employed in agriculture for a variety of reasons, including
    high interpretation, increased harvest yield, minimal energy usage, and data distribution.
    Agriculture relies heavily on effective water management [ 25]. Water scarcity
    and high pumping costs make good water management even more important. To improve
    the use of water resources and increase productivity, one automatic irrigation
    system (AIS) is now deployed [ 25]. This one component of the irrigation system
    enables development in areas where water is scarce. In this method, efficient
    watering system planning yields the best efficiency while using the least quantity
    of water [ 23, 25]. In areas where water is scarce, water management is critical.
    Agriculture is also affected, as a substantial volume of water is dedicated to
    that purpose [ 25, 26]. As a result of the potential impacts of global warming,
    water adaptation methods are being considered to assure the availability of water
    for food production and consumption. As a result, the need for studies that aimed
    at reducing water usage in the irrigation process has increased over time. Commercial
    sensors for agricultural irrigation systems are quite expensive, making this type
    of device unaffordable for smaller farmers. Manufacturers as well as the users
    are now interested in low-cost sensors that may be connected to nodes to create
    cost-effective irrigation control and agricultural monitoring systems [ 25, 26].
    Hence, this study focused on designing and implementing a SIS controller for use
    with drip irrigation owing to its cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Drip irrigation
    entails laying emitter-equipped tubing alongside plants on the ground. Water drips
    softly into the root zone from the drippers. Because moisture levels are regulated
    at an ideal range, plant production and quality improve. Drip irrigation also
    prevents disease by minimizing water contact with the leaves, stems, and fruit
    of plants; allows the rows between plants to remain dry, improving access and
    reducing weed growth; saves time, money, and water due to the system’s efficiency;
    reduces labour; increases effectiveness on uneven ground; and reduces water and
    nutrient leaching below the root zone. The design focused on using a microcontroller
    ESP8266 system on a chip acting as the coordinator module and moisture and temperature
    sensors acting as the transmitter module. The system uses a cloud computing (CC)
    platform and an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) MATLAB platform called “ThingSpeak”
    for collecting, storing, and transmitting data. The sensor values are received
    and compiled by the microcontroller, which then sends them to the “ThingSpeak
    cloud” via the HTTP protocol. When the soil threshold moisture value is low in
    the morning or evening, the system automatically waters the plants, unless it
    is raining. It is programmed to collect, store, and analyze environmental parameters
    such as rain, temperature, and humidity in order to actuate autonomous responses
    (i.e., start and stop the pump). When the anticipated, desired or required soil
    moisture content is reached, the system automatically stops the irrigation process,
    saving water and energy. We can monitor and control the system using a web application.
    The rest of the section of the study is structured into the following four main
    sections: Section 2 will focus on existing systems, the concept of IoT, wireless
    sensor network (WSN), data analytics, and “ThingSpeak,” their overall functionality
    and history, and future prospects of such systems. Section 3 will focus on the
    development methodologies used to conduct the research. Data collection and system
    analysis processes are discussed. Section 4 will place much emphasis on the implementation
    of the research, which is analyzed and discussed. Section 5 will emphasize the
    discussion of findings and a summary of the study. 2. Literature Review The need
    to automate irrigation and agricultural activities and use the limited or inadequate
    battery power of a node competently has led to several hardware and software advances
    in the sensor network area [ 27]. This study by Kagalkar [ 28] found that SIS
    was designed to fulfil the water supplies or necessities of the plants by monitoring
    the soil moisture as well as other ecological parameters. The system was tested
    with potatoes to see how well it worked. The potato plant’s water requirements
    were 500 mm to 700 mm per area a day. The soil moisture was set to 300–600, which
    was predicated on IoT. Every 30 seconds, it logs the sensor data to the CC platform
    “ThingSpeak.com.” The analysis was shown in graph form, and the farmer could remotely
    monitor and control the water pump over the Internet using a Wi-Fi module to access
    the web interface on an Android application. As mentioned by Santhiya et al. [
    29], in the design of SIS, the Arduino UNO microcontroller and Android are connected
    with a personal computer, data mining, and CC to store the data that are read
    by temperature and humidity sensors. The graph generated in the web application
    makes easy analysis and the drip is managed. The proposed or planned system turns
    “ON/OFF” the drip utilizing Bluetooth. The project developed by Kashif and Poonguzhali
    [ 30] was an automatic irrigation system (AIS), which waters the crops based on
    sensing the dryness of the land or soil. It uses wireless transmission techniques,
    that is, RF transmission technique, mobile phones to receive SMS and to update
    users about the condition of the plant. Web technology is used to view sensor
    values, which aid monitoring and control to curtail the wastage of water utilized
    in the irrigation progression. This process also helped to improve the agricultural
    production. This study “IoT-based Smart Agriculture” developed by Gondchawar and
    Kawitkar [ 31] shows all observations and experimental tests demonstrate that
    the development is a broad solution to field actions, irrigation issues, and storage
    issues, by employing remote-controlled robots, SIS, and a smart warehouse management
    system, respectively. These processes will be done by means of any remote smart
    device or computer connected to the Internet, and the processes will be carried
    out by interfacing sensors, Wi-Fi or ZigBee modules, cameras, and actuators with
    microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. The research environment is more persuaded
    towards research at the software level as it has several possibilities, opportunities,
    and great potential to yield momentous results. Data collected by sensors are
    removed by several applications, which set up data flow or communication of data
    in the network. As mentioned by Sarkar et al. [ 32] in their work, they developed
    smart agriculture using IoT and different sensors for implementing or executing
    the smart agricultural and monitoring systems by utilizing various sensors within
    the agricultural field, pH sensor, moisture sensor, humidity sensor, and proximity
    sensor for analyzing and sending data to the Raspberry Pi remotely, which is then
    sent to Krishi Helpline for plant or crop monitoring for maximum or optimal production
    of crops or plants. 2.1. Overview and Use of IoT Ashton [ 33] coined the term
    “IoT,” and RFID-based item identification systems were also invented in the same
    year. According to Kashif and Poonguzhali [ 30], IoT research is still early.
    As a result, there is no universally accepted definition for IoT. Cabine [ 34]
    described “IOT as the ever-growing network of physical objects that feature an
    IP address for Internet connectivity and the communication that occurs between
    these objects and other internet-enabled devices and systems.” It is also referred
    to as machine-to-machine (M2M), sky net, or Internet of everything, things having
    identities and virtual personalities operating in smart spaces using intelligent
    interfaces to connect and communicate within social, environmental, and user contexts.
    A variety of scholars provided the definitions below as adopted and modified from
    Silverio-Fernández et al. [ 35] and Sethi and Sarangi [ 36]: (i) “Things have
    virtual personalities that operate in smart spaces using intelligent interfaces
    to connect and communicate within social, environmental, and user contexts.” (ii)
    “The semantic origin of the expression is composed of two words and concepts:
    IoT, where the Internet can be defined as a global network of interconnected computer
    networks based on a standard communication protocol, the Internet suite (TCP/IP),”
    and “thing” is an unidentified object. As a result, the term “IoT” refers to a
    “global network of interconnected, uniquely addressable objects based on standard
    communication protocols.” (iii) “IoT enables people and things to connect anytime,
    anywhere, with anything and anyone, ideally over any path or network and using
    any service.” Other definitions are as follows: (i) “A dynamic global network
    infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable
    communication protocols where physical and virtual ‘Things’ have identities, physical
    attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are
    seamlessly integrated into the information network [ 37].” (ii) “Things having
    identities and virtual personalities operating in smart spaces using intelligent
    interfaces to connect and communicate within social, environmental, and user contexts
    [ 38].” According to Cabine [ 34], “things in the IoT can refer to a wide variety
    of devices such as heart monitoring implants, biochip transponders on farm animals,
    automobiles with built-in sensors, or field operation devices that assist firefighters
    in search and rescue. Current market examples include smart thermostat systems
    and washer/dryers that utilize Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.” The US National Intelligence
    Council (NIC), in their description of IoT in April 2008, considers IoT as one
    of the 6 Disruptive Civil Technologies. The IEEE ranks IoT number 1 in the list
    of “Top Trends for 2013.” The IoT promises to be the most disruptive technological
    revolution since the advent of the World Wide Web. According to Cabine [ 34],
    “projections indicate that up to 100 billion uniquely identifiable objects will
    be connected to the Internet by 2020.” The implementation of a SIS made it possible
    to monitor, manage, and control various variables in agriculture, thanks to technological
    advancements in sensor networks (SNs). Recent advances in sensor and wireless
    radio frequency (RF) machineries, as well as their merging with the Internet,
    have opened up a slew of new possibilities for agricultural sensor systems. The
    IoT and SN are two of the most important technologies driving the development
    of SIS. The technology issues with SIS revolve around improving the SN’s efficiency
    and the system’s ability to function and perform efficiently. NS to explicate
    important environmental patterns and integrate their data streams not only to
    display or record information, but also to stimulate human and self-sufficient
    (autonomous) responses, will result in increased agricultural efficiency. The
    IoT architecture adopted and designed for this study is shown in Figure 1.    Figure
    1  IoT architecture designed for this study. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Specification
    of Adopted and Designed IoT Components Several microcontrollers that can be used,
    but the ESP8266 NodeMCU development board has been adopted in this study (Figure
    2). The ESP8266EX includes a Tensilica L106 32-bit RISC processor that consumes
    very little power and runs at a maximum clock speed of 160 MHz. Thanks to the
    real-time operating system (RTOS) and Wi-Fi stack, 80% of the processing power
    is available for user application programming and development, which combines
    elements of easy programming with the Arduino IDE (C++). It includes an 802.11 b/g/n
    HT40 Wi-Fi transceiver, allowing it to connect to a Wi-Fi network and interact
    with the Internet, as well as create its own network for other devices to connect
    to. There is also 128 Kb of RAM and 4 Mb of Flash memory (for program and data
    storage), which is more than enough to handle the large strings that make up web
    pages, JSON/XML data, and anything else we throw at IoT devices.    Figure 2  E8266
    node microcontroller unit pinout SP (as adopted from SP https://www.make-it.ca/nodemcu-details-specifications/).
    A resistance temperature device (RTD) DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor was
    used in this study (Figure 3). This sealed digital temperature probe lets one
    precisely measure temperature in wet environments with a sample 1-wire interface.
    The DS18B20 provides 9- to 12-bit (configurable) temperature readings over a 1-wire
    interface, so that only one wire (and ground) needs to be connected to a central
    microprocessor.    Figure 3  Temperature sensor probe (as adopted from https://www.med-linket.com/products/temperature/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyYKUBhDJARIsAMj9lkEILNuL8rZfc7x9BLNb4a3nYZhb-Gw2XWm2SDcb1uyk50hrph80JxwaAi4XEALw_wcB).
    A corrosion-resistant soil moisture sensor was incorporated to measure the moisture
    content of the soil (Figure 4). It contains two probes: the positive (+) end is
    connected to the positive power supply, and the negative (−) end is connected
    to the negative pole of the power supply. The blue potentiometer adjusts clockwise/counter-clockwise
    to decrease the probe detection sensitivity. It will show that the adjustment
    range has been tested, and at the time, the indicator is on. AO is an analogue
    (voltage) output, which can be directly detected by the AD port of the microcontroller.    Figure

    A real-time clock (RTC) DS3231 RTC was adopted in this study (Figure 5). It is
    an I2C RTC with an integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO)
    and crystal that is low cost and extremely accurate. The device has a battery
    input and maintains accurate timekeeping even when the device’s main power is
    lost. The RTC keeps track of seconds, minutes, hours, days, dates, months, and
    years. For months with fewer than 31 days, the date at the end of the month is
    automatically adjusted, including leap year corrections. The clock has a 24-hour
    or 12-hour format, as well as an active-low AM/PM indicator.    Figure 5  RTC

    The Sim800L GSM module was used in this study. It is easy to connect to Arduino
    and other microcontroller units. It has a 100% high quality, 3.75% work voltage,
    Quad-Band 850/900/1800/1900 MHz network support that would work on GSM networks
    in all countries around the world, and a transistor-transistor logic serial interface
    that is compatible with 3.3 V and 5 V. Pinout for the Sim800L GSM module is shown
    in Figure 6.    Figure 6  Sim800L GSM module pinout (as adopted from https://components101.com/wireless/sim800l-gsm-module-pinout-datasheet-equivalent-circuit-specs).
    The Nokia 5110 LCD display was incorporated in this research. The module was designed
    to work with the long-lasting Nokia 5110 mobile phone, as the name suggests. The
    PCD8544 is a low-power CMOS LCD controller/driver that is designed to drive a
    graphic display with 48 rows and 84 columns. It includes on-chip generation of
    LCD supply and bias voltages, resulting in low-power consumption, making it suitable
    for power-constrained applications. The LCD only uses 6 to 7 milliamps in its
    normal state. All the components were interfaced on a PCB board. Components are
    typically soldered to the PCB in order to connect them electrically and mechanically.
    The number of pinouts on the LCD and a description of each pinout are shown in
    Figure 7.    Figure 7  The Nokia 5110 LCD pinout (as adopted from https://components101.com/displays/nokia-5110-lcd).
    3.2. Data Collection The SIS was designed and implemented as an IoT device used
    for automated modelling and sequential data collection of real-time measurements
    of environmental parameters such as soil moisture values, soil temperature values,
    sunlight, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pump action using an adaptive sampling
    technique [ 25, 26]. This technique enabled the collection of samples from a small
    vegetable garden in Abuja, Nigeria. The workflow followed in the development of
    SIS is as follows: (1) Boot the system. (2) Get soil temperature and soil moisture
    data from sensors. (3) Search and connect to Wi-Fi and create a hotspot (smart
    farm). (4) Restart the system if the Wi-Fi connection fails. (5) Download the
    weather forecast for your current location (Abuja); this includes the amount of
    sunshine, humidity, rainfall, and atmospheric temperature. (6) If any download
    fails, restart the system (jump to 1). (7) Upload soil data as well as a weather
    forecast to the ThingSpeak channel. (8) Restart the system if the upload fails.
    (9) Refresh all of the data on the LCD. (10) If the system boot time is less than
    one minute, send a start-up SMS and make a phone call. (11) If there is an incoming
    GSM call, then send SMS and call. (12) Check the RTC for the time of day. (13)
    If the time of day (x) is (7 × 11) OR (7 × 11) AND the soil moisture threshold
    value AND the rainfall (50%). (14) Update soil data (soil temperature and soil
    moisture). (15) If the time between the last download and upload was more than
    15 minutes, skip to step 5; otherwise, skip to step 9. The classification model
    was designed to manage real-world data and logical levels are used to classify
    data, categorizing the various parameters and evaluating and meeting the water
    requirements for a crop. The data values collected every 15 minutes were sent
    to the IoT CC platform “ThingSpeak” to predict the threshold status of water requirements.
    The data-driven approximation model, known as the data model, approach was used.
    The model uses a response from the emulator for design optimization, analysis,
    exploration, and performance evaluation. Improving the workflow involved following
    the iterative process in the sequential design, with an adaptive sampling algorithm
    selecting data points in each iteration, guided by a dataset that has already
    been retrieved and stored in the cloud (see Figures 8 and 9). From Figure 8, we
    can view the information collected by the SIS downloaded from the CC platform
    “ThingSpeak.com” using Microsoft Excel and processed using Jupyter Notebook and
    Python to extract information.    Figure 8  The first 10 rows of the dataset.    Figure
    9  The last 10 rows of the dataset. 3.3. Implementation of Software and Hardware
    The implementation of the SIS involves the integration of both hardware and software
    components, which was required as one of the methodologies to be followed. For
    hardware design, we used physical components, which are necessary to implement
    the new system. This system was broken down into different units as listed below:
    power control unit, GSM module unit, moisture and temperature sensor unit, RTC
    unit, microcontroller unit, LCD display unit, and the printed circuit board (PCB).
    The software design approach involves sets of tools that are required to run the
    system effectively. They include the following: (i) Arduino IDE for Firmware design
    using C/C++ (ii) An application browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape
    Navigator. (iii) Use Notepad++ for web interface design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    programs to run it. (iv) An Internet service provider (ISP) or a Wi-Fi modem to
    facilitate logging into the system. (v) Python for over-the-air (OTA) upload of
    data collected and system update. (vi) Use the ThingSpeak channel for data visualization.
    (vii) Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis. (viii) Using the ES8266
    (SOC) system on chip as the system web server The approach involves breaking down
    a system into smaller units to get more insight into its compositional subsystems
    in a reverse engineering way. Figure 10 shows the block and circuit diagram of
    the SIS.    Figure 10  The block and circuit diagram of the SIS. 3.4. Working
    Mechanism of the SIS The proposed SIS was designed and implemented with the capability
    to make smart decisions when water is required by plants considering environmental
    factors such as rain, sunlight, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature,
    and weather forecast. There is an apparent relationship between these environmental
    factors, and all of the logical relationships between these environmental factors
    will be determined by the SIS design, and it is crucial for the implementation
    of the SIS system. The data values collected every 15 minutes to predict the threshold
    status of water requirement are sent to the IoT CC platform “ThingSpeak,” a platform
    for data collection, storage, analytics, and visualization. The data model is
    designed to manage real-world data and logical levels are used to classify data,
    categorizing the various parameters and evaluating and meeting the water requirements
    for a particular plant. Sensor data and weather forecast data are used to make
    smart decisions for watering plants based on the ontology, and a machine learning
    model is used to evaluate the performance of the system and can be deployed with
    the ontology to make smarter decisions to actuate autonomous responses (i.e.,
    start and stop the pump). A web application can be used to monitor and control
    system response. Figure 11 shows the working prototype of the SIS.    Figure 11  The
    working prototype of the SIS. 3.5. System Coding and Implementation Different
    hardware and software tools were used in the design and implementation of the
    SIS, but the central focus here is using the IoT to produce autonomous responses
    using data analytics. However, in this project, we focus on the utilization of
    “ThingSpeak,” a MATLAB platform for data collection, data visualization, data
    processing, and analysis (MATLAB tool, adopted from https://www.mathworks.com).
    The system was programmed so that it uses data retrieved from the system to perform
    irrigation. 4. Results and Discussions The SIS master node controller controls
    the processes using the workflow. The sensor devices and web logs or data files
    are submitted (using the native Python library). To track results, an integrated
    web service built with ThingSpeak was created using the LCD interface or visualized
    using a web interface to monitor results. It displays the content of the output
    directory processes and the model data, including channel information, model graphs
    or plots, and configuration used over the HTTP protocol, which was aggregated
    into a web page. ThingSpeak sets up a WebSocket to collect and process the log
    messages of events. It also uses the Java Logging API, which sends the message
    to the WebSocket. The GSM module aids in sending SMS to a mobile, which is also
    used to monitor system status. For each field, the channel is updated and the
    visualization can be viewed in Figures 12–14 for the soil temperature, soil moisture,
    and rainfall, respectively.    Figure 12  Soil temperature.    Figure 13  Soil
    moisture.    Figure 14  Rainfall. From Figure 12, the soil temperature drops with
    time as the day light/sunshine goes down. From the figure, the temperature dropped
    from 23° to 21° after 4:00 pm. From Figure 13, the graph shows the variations
    in the water content in the soil as it flows down with time. The highest value
    of soil moisture was reached. From Figure 14, it is evident from the graph that
    no rainfall was recorded between these times. As this research depends on using
    rain information to predict irrigation schedules, the system will wait for rain
    to water the plant if there is a possibility of rain. The data from sensors (i.e.,
    moisture and temperature, humidity reading), sprinkler/pump state, and web (i.e.,
    rain, sunshine, temp) are loaded from the SIS and displayed on the LCD. The data
    (system status) are output on the LCD. The LCD display (output) is shown in Figure
    15.    Figure 15  LCD output. The ESP8266 Node MCU can execute as a whole standalone
    system, reducing stack overhead on the main application processor. It is used
    as a web server to display system status on my web interface. The ESP8266 can
    interface with other systems to provide “Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality.” It
    can be viewed when you connect to the SIS Wi-Fi and then open the web browser
    and enter 192.168.4.1. It displays the result as a set of tables showing the output
    for each event, as shown in Figure 16.    Figure 16  Web interface display. However,
    the “A6 GSM Module” provides a serial port to communicate through GPRS, sending
    information in phone calls and text messages. The void A6_sms_send() function
    enables sending SMS to my phone number. It can also make calls using the void
    ctrl_call() function to alert you that the system is now active or activated for
    irrigation, monitoring, and control, as shown in Figures 17 and 18.    Figure
    17  SMS.    Figure 18  Call management. 4.1. Techniques for Model Evaluation and
    Analysis Data analysis was developed for effective system performance. A web application
    is employed to monitor and control the status of the system. A supervised machine
    learning approach was used according to Mohammad and Sulaiman [ 39]. There are
    threshold metrics for classification evaluations using the confusion matrix as
    our model evaluation matrix. There is a list of rates that are computed from the
    confusion matrix for a binary classifier and multiclass classification as shown
    in Table 1. Table 1  The threshold metrics for classification evaluations. 4.2.
    Summary of Evaluation Results Based on the data analysis, the following major
    finding was discovered: the first feature could be summarized by the “confusion
    matrix” in Table 2. Table 2  The “confusion matrix” table. Represented as “true
    positive (TP) = 2386, true negative (TN) = 188, false positive (FP = 191), and
    false negative (TN) = 188.” The results from the confusion matrix are shown in
    the classification summary results, which shows the accuracy to be 0.89, which
    is high, the misclassification rate (error rate) is equal to 0.1, the sensitivity
    is high and is equal to 0.79, the specificity is equal to 0.93, and the precision
    of the model is 0.81. The evaluation is compared with another machine learning
    algorithm like K-NN using K = 6 and K = 1. The prediction accuracy was evaluated,
    and it shows that KNN is 0.97 and 0.98. k = 6 and k = 1 have a higher score for
    prediction accuracy. This implies that the smart system irrigation system has
    a high accuracy capable of predicting the water needs of plants up to 98%. The
    advantages of the SIS controller design used in this study when compared to other
    previous designs are evident owing to its cost-effectiveness and efficiency. It
    is, however, suggested that more advancement of this SIS controller design should
    be prospectively given appropriate attention subsequently. 5. Conclusion Although
    the study’s goals and objectives were met to a satisfactory level, a working prototype
    was developed, as shown in Figure 11. The system was tested on a small vegetable
    farm that requires water in the morning and evening when the soil water level
    is below 50%, and irrigation is turned off when the required threshold value is
    reached. The entire process can be monitored and controlled using a web browser
    on a mobile phone or personal computer. The design saves farmers time and money
    on irrigation, improves efficiency, and increases crop yield. In the future, the
    focus should be on incorporating and integrating more sensors to collect more
    data, as well as CCTV cameras to deter intruders. For harvesting, farmers should
    use SIS in all areas. It is therefore recommended that due to the epileptic power
    supply from Nigerian power providers, solar power and backup batteries should
    be used to supplement the main power supply. Data Availability The data used to

  description: Air pollution is one of the main environmental problems in cities and
    industrial areas, among some of the sources we can mention the use of fossil fuels,
    emissions from industries and mining. In Colombia, air pollution prevention and
    control policies include tax incentives, which can be accessed through the use
    of sustainable buildings that demonstrate a positive impact, promoting the search
    for techniques or methods to control and measure air pollution. This project promotes
    the development of new sustainable construction techniques to control air pollution
    through the implementation of a phytoremediation system, that is, through plants
    that allow purification to generate pleasant environments or environments for
    people. At the same time, the residue of the rice husk is used to improve the
    physical and mechanical properties of the construction units, complying with the
    construction regulations. The installation process of the constructive unit is
    made from a concrete block which part of the sand is replaced with rice husk ash
    and by modulating the blocks it forms a vertical garden. The system works like
    the natural lungs of the planet, capable of absorbing, metabolizing or stabilizing
    the pollutants present in the air of the different living and commercial spaces.It
    also has hidden irrigation subsystems, it has cavities for planting the plants
    and it has with a monitoring subsystem through sensors for the maintenance and
    visualization of data in the cloud. The project methodology consisted of 4 phases;
    Initially, a group of local plants capable of purifying the air were selected,
    then an irrigation system was developed that is hidden in the cavities of the
    Green Construction Unit, later a mixture is designed to improve the block by implementing
    the ash of the rice husk, and finally a monitoring subsystem was developed for
    the maintenance and supervision of the performance of each wall in the city. The
    new Green Construction Unit is installed in the different environments of the
    city of Barranquilla (Colombia), a total of 19.9 m2 of UCV 2.0 operating and fulfilling
    the main objective of cleaning 13 134 tons of harmful gases per year. The monitoring
    system could be installed on the company’s wall and is currently transmitting
    the data to the server of the web application that is already developed

    Palabras clave: biofilia, construcción sostenible, diseño arquitectónico, fitorremediación,
    purificación Resumen La contaminación atmosférica es uno de los principales problemas
    ambientales de las ciudades y zonas industriales, entre algunas de las fuentes
    se puede mencionar el uso de combustibles fósiles, las emisiones de las industrias
    y la explotación minera. En Colombia, las políticas de prevención y control de
    la contaminación del aire incluyen incentivos tributarios (Pedraza, 2015), a los
    que se puede acceder mediante el uso de construcciones sostenibles que demuestren
    un impacto positivo, impulsando la búsqueda de técnicas o métodos para controlar
    y medir la contaminación del aire. El presente proyecto promueve el desarrollo
    de nuevas técnicas de construcción sostenible, para el control de la contaminación
    del aire a través de la implementación de un sistema de fitorremediación, es decir
    a través de las plantas que permiten la purificación para generar ambientes o
    entornos agradables para las personas. Al mismo tiempo se aprovecha el residuo
    de la cascarilla de arroz para mejorar las propiedades físicas y mecánicas de
    las unidades constructivas cumpliendo con las normas de construcción. El proceso
    de instalación de la unidad constructiva se hace a partir de un bloque de concreto
    el que parte de la arena se reemplaza con ceniza de cascarilla de arroz y mediante
    la modulación de los bloques conforma un jardín vertical. El sistema funciona
    al igual que los pulmones naturales del planeta, capaces de absorber, metabolizar
    o estabilizar los contaminantes presentes en el aire de los diferentes espacios
    habitables y comerciales, También tiene subsistemas ocultos de irrigación, posee
    cavidades para la siembra de las plantas y cuenta con un subsistema de monitoreo
    a través de sensores para el mantenimiento y visualización de los datos en la
    nube. La metodología del proyecto consistió en 4 fases; inicialmente se seleccionaron
    un grupo de plantas locales capaces de purificar el aire, luego se hizo el desarrollo
    de un sistema de riego que se oculta en las cavidades de la Unidad Constructiva
    Verde, de manera posterior se diseña una mezcla para mejorar el bloque implementando
    la ceniza de la cascarilla de arroz, y finalmente se desarrolló un subsistema
    de monitoreo para el mantenimiento y supervisión del desempeño de cada muro en
    la ciudad. La nueva Unidad Constructiva Verde está instalada en los diferentes
    ambientes de la ciudad de Barranquilla, un total 19,9 m2 de UCV 2.0 funcionando
    y cumpliendo el objetivo principal de limpiar 13,134 toneladas de gases nocivos
    anuales. El sistema de monitoreo pudo ser instalado en el muro de la empresa y
    actualmente se encuentra transmitiendo los datos al servidor propio del aplicativo
    web que ya se encuentra desarrollado. Descargas Citas Dodge Data & Analytics.

    of abundant water resources, and many of its states are predicted to face severe
    drought soon. This is due to the wastage of water owing to poor management. Now,
    as  we know agriculture is the primary consumer of water and if we can design
    and implement systems that can reduce the wastage in agricultural fields, then
    we can save a lot of water every year. To achieve this efficiency, manual systems
    of irrigation are not good enough and need a technology-aided system which may
    be automatic or semi-automatic and hence comes into picture the technology-aided
    system which is better known as smart irrigation systems. 1.2 Literature Review
    Pednekar et al. [1] have proposed a system using a soil moisture sensor, microcontroller,
    and Zigbee. Zigbee is used for wireless communication between sender and receiver.
    In addition to this, a GSM module has also been added for alerting the user regarding
    the moisture content of the soil. Thamaraimanalan et al. [2] have discussed designing
    an IoT-based system using sensors and NodeMCU. Sensors like a soil moisture sensor,
    a temperature and humidity sensor, and an ultrasonic sensor have been used for
    the application. An android application has been developed and taken into use
    for remote monitoring and controlling the system. Bafna et al. [3] have developed
    a system using Arduino Uno, NodeMCU, and soil moisture sensor. For storing data,
    the Firebase application has been taken into use. They have also developed an
    android application, wherein location-based weather prediction is done using mobile
    GPS and weather API, and based on this prediction and sensor data, users can decide
    whether to turn ON the motor or not. A system using cloud-based application ThingSpeak,
    a light sensor, and a soil moisture sensor that have been interfaced with Arduino
    Uno and Arduino Wi-Fi shield has been proposed and developed by Al-Omary et al.
    [4]. The ThingSpeak channel has been used to store the threshold values of moisture
    content of soil and the amount of light required for plants to enable the system
    to make decisions based on those threshold values and sensor readings. Garg et
    al. [5] have reviewed some of the soil moisture sensors already available and
    discussed their specifications, properties, applicability, advantages, and disadvantages,
    hence making it easier to select which type of sensor will be suitable for us.
    Arduino-based smart irrigation system using GSM module and sun tracking solar
    system has been explored by Karmokar et al. [6]. The solar tracking feature is
    the main focus of this project. This feature helps to consume the maximum energy
    from the sun, while the sun changes its azimuth over the day. Hatanaka et al.
    [7] have talked about the use of a tensiometer, which works on the principle of
    measuring the pressure force required to extract moisture from the porous cap
    presented in the soil, as a potential way of measuring soil moisture. They designed
    the system as a client–server system, where the client is the user who uses the
    interface developed to fetch data from the server. The server system consists
    of the grove moisture sensor along with Arduino Uno and Ethernet shield. Jain
    and Kumar [8] have developed a smart irrigation system using sensors like soil
    moisture sensor, water-level sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and
    an ARM7 processor. A water-level sensor is used to keep track of the water present
    in a water tank. A system was developed by Athani et al. [9] where a soil moisture
    sensor is connected to an Arduino which is, in turn, interfaced with an android
    application using a Wi-Fi shield. Soil moisture is continuously monitored by the
    sensor, and the output values are stored in a database. The output values are
    fetched from the database and displayed in the android application. Divya Dhatri
    et al. [10] have designed a low-cost Arduino-based irrigation system using a soil
    moisture sensor. An LCD module is used to display the relevant information and
    status of the motor. Prasojo et al. [11] have designed a smart irrigation system
    using a basic sensor like soil moisture sensor and Arduino Uno along with other
    modules like relay module, LCD module, and solenoid valve motor. A detailed discussion
    on soil water content and threshold limits for irrigation management has been
    done by Datta et al. [12]. The terms related to soil moisture condition like volumetric
    water content, soil matric potential, saturation, and field capacity have been
    introduced and discussed in detail. Patel et al. [13] have discussed an Arduino-based
    irrigation system that consists of sensors connected to it and an ESP8266 module
    for Internet connectivity to send data to the ThingSpeak channel. It has a wireless
    sensor network for real-time sensing of irrigation systems. This system avoids
    wastage of water by automatically switching ON the motor when the moisture level
    in the soil reaches below a threshold value. All current statuses of the system
    will be displayed in the user’s android application. A discussion on implementing
    an irrigation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) using ESP8266 NodeMCU
    and temperature and humidity sensor has been done by Anitha et al. [14]. The ThingSpeak
    server is taken into use to keep track of the moisture level in the soil and to
    store the data in the IoT cloud. Also, rain alarm and soil moisture detector circuits
    are used to build the smart irrigation system. Naeem et al. [15] have discussed
    developing an irrigation system by integrating a real-time monitoring system having
    remote controllability and cloud computation of stored data. In addition, a mobile
    application has also been developed for a better user experience. They have designed
    the system using various sensors and water-level detector in addition to NodeMCU
    and Arduino development board. An irrigation system was developed by Karpagam
    et al. [16] using Arduino UNO, soil moisture sensor, water-level sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, and GSM module. With the help of the GSM module, the information
    regarding the ON and OFF states of the water pump is sent to the user. Sen et
    al. [17] have utilized Arduino UNO and ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to design their system.
    Arduino collects all sensor data and sent them to the ThingSpeak channel using
    the ESP module. Smart irrigation is of priority to many researchers nowadays,
    and it is evident from the fact that a lot of work have been done concerning it.
    Research works on smart irrigation have been studied, and based on the shortcomings
    of the available research work, this work has been executed. The research works
    discussed above have some limitations like without a rain sensor the system would
    not be able to sense if it is raining and thus turn OFF the motor in case it is
    turned ON at that instant. Also, rain prediction using weather API and location
    extraction using GPS module will help the existing system extensively in making
    accurate decision. These two features have been added in this work to make the
    system truly smart decision-making device. 2 System Design and Implementation
    The architecture of the designed system prototype is shown in Fig. 1. It shows
    the microcontroller in the centre as the decision-making hub, and all the sensors
    and modules are connected to it. The phone block shown in the block diagram is
    not connected directly to the microcontroller but is shown as a symbol to signify
    that it is a part of the working system. The phone is used in the system as an
    additional component to alert the user by sending SMS. Fig. 1 System architecture
    Full size image Figure 2 shows the implemented hardware. It shows the actual sensors
    and modules used in this work. Figure 3 shows the flow chart of the system. First,
    the system is turned ON by supplying power to the Arduino and the GSM-GPS module.
    As soon as the system is turned ON, the soil moisture sensor reads the moisture
    content of the soil, and the temperature and humidity sensor reads the temperature
    and humidity of the place surrounding that system. These collected data are then
    sent to a ThingSpeak channel where we can store them. Fig. 2 Implemented hardware
    Full size image Fig. 3 Flow chart Full size image The GPS integrated along with
    the GSM module determines the geographical coordinates of the location where the
    system is placed in the form of latitude and longitude. An API weather call is
    made in the OpenWeather website by making use of the determined coordinates which
    fetches weather data of the given location in JSON format and contains information
    related to rain, wind speed, wind direction, clouds, etc. The rain sensor module
    used in the system keeps checking the wetness of the board for determining if
    it is raining. Now, all the data that are collected by the sensors will be compared
    against their respective threshold limits already set by the user. If the result
    of comparison meets the set threshold limits, then the input signal of the relay
    is set high which would turn on the motor till threshold moisture condition is
    not reached. 3 Results and Discussion ThingSpeak, a cloud-based IoT platform from
    Mathworks has been used for storing the sensor data sent by the Arduino microcontroller.
    These data are plotted in ThingSpeak in the form of graphs which give a better
    visualization of the data. Some of the screenshots of the plotted data are shown
    in Fig. 4a–e. Also, ThingSpeak has the feature of remotely controlling the system
    based on the analysis of the stored data. Fig. 4 a Temperature field. b Humidity
    fields. c Soil moisture content field. d Temperature threshold field. e Soil moisture
    threshold fields Full size image Figure 4a shows the plot of temperature reading
    from the DHT11 sensor versus time. The graph shows the values of temperature recorded
    along the y-axis at different instants of time. Since there are slight variations
    in temperatures recorded, the graph seems to have abrupt changes in readings.
    Figure 4b shows the reading of humidity recorded by the sensor at different instants
    of time. The maximum and minimum humidity recorded were 95% and 93%, respectively.
    As the variation in humidity is very less, hence the graph is having abrupt changes,
    i.e. spikes. Figure 4c shows the graph of soil moisture content of the soil of
    the location where the device was placed. The system was tested for its performance
    at different levels of soil moisture content, and hence, there are variations
    in reading as seen in the graph. Figure 4d, e represents the temperature threshold,
    soil moisture threshold and are constant that depend on the type of soil and crops
    grown. These values are stored in the ThingSpeak channel in the form of bar graphs
    and not as continuous line graphs at different instants of time and hence seem
    to have some values missing. 4 Conclusion A prototype of an IoT-based advanced
    irrigation system has been designed and implemented using different sensors and
    modules. This system was developed to provide a cost-effective, reliable, and
    user-friendly system for the mass to achieve the goal of smart irrigation to a
    great extent. In this work, we have utilized the cloud-based application “ThingSpeak”
    to store, visualize, and analyse the data captured by various sensors. All the
    data were sent continuously to the ThingSpeak channel over the Internet. GSM module
    was used for two specific reasons: first to solve the problem of Internet connectivity
    in any remote location and second to send SMS alerts to the user. The system thus
    developed can take readings from the sensors interfaced with Arduino, sent them
    to the cloud for storage and analysis, fetch rain probability data, sense rainfall,
    and finally combine all these data to make a decision. The smart irrigation system
    discussed in this work is found to perform better when compared to similar types
    of existing systems in terms of rainfall sensing and prediction due to the use
    of a rain sensor and API weather call. References Pednekar S, Lohani RB, Gawde

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction
    The Internet of things has a wide range of applications in many fields. Due to
    its advent of it, the systems can be monitored online without any human intervention.
    The data can be uploaded to the cloud. The operator anywhere in the world with
    his mobile and internet can go to the Thing Speak website and can monitor the
    sensor readings remotely. Augmented Reality (AR) is also emerging drastically.
    AR is a technology for viewing the physical, real-world directly or indirectly.
    The virtual elements such as sensor data, graphics, sound, video are augmented
    by the input generated by the computer. AR can be utilized as an interface to
    visualize the IoT-connected devices and can monitor them as well. The operations
    team can make use of the IoT for controlling and monitoring the IoT-connected
    devices and can make faster decisions in accomplishing a task. The maintenance
    teams can make use of this Augmented reality for better reliability. With the
    combination of these two things, many complex problems can be solved and assist
    the operators of the system in accomplishing a task. These days almost every device
    is connected to the Global internet with the development of a microcontroller.
    The operators of the IoT-connected machines can use a Human-machine interface
    (HMI), web to control and monitor comfortably for a small number of machines.
    But for a large number of machines, it is cumbersome to use these technologies
    as an interface to monitor and control these machines. In this case, AR can be
    utilized for inserting virtual objects in the real world and can monitor them
    effortlessly and efficiently. Unity 3D can be used as an environment to run this
    integration of IoT and AR. The two types of AR available are marker type and markerless
    type. For the markerless type, the 3D virtual CAD model can be superimposed anywhere
    on the mobile while capturing the video. Whereas in the case of marker type, the
    Vuforia SDK automatically detects the image target and superimposes the 3D virtual
    CAD model there It is important to monitor the temperature and humidity of the
    work environment. If the temperature reaches a higher level than the limit, then
    there will be serious consequences if it is not monitored and noticed in time.
    So, the data needs to be collected using temperature sensors like DHT11 and use
    controllers like NodemCU containing Wi-Fi module for processing the incoming data
    from sensors and sending them to the Web server for online monitoring of the parameters
    like temperature periodically. In the Webserver like ThingSpeak, the incoming
    data from sensors is shown in the form of graphs. But due to many machines working
    in the manufacturing plant, it is difficult and not convenient to visualize the
    sensor data in the form of numbers and texts. For effective and convenient visualization
    of the sensor data corresponding to that particular sensor of that machine, Augmented
    reality can be utilized. Here the CAD model of the manufacturing plant can be
    constructed and imported to Unity3D. The output text panels for presenting the
    sensor data can be virtually placed over that particular machine in an AR camera
    through Vuforia Engine. In this way, it is quick to monitor the machines and take
    necessary steps if anything drifts from the set value. In irrigation of agriculture,
    if the land is over-or under-irrigated, it will affect the growth of a plant.
    Standard moisture has to be maintained. If there is an inadequate amount of it,
    the farmer has to take action. The soil moisture sensors can be used for detecting
    the soil moisture and sent to the NodemCU which is connected to the Wi-Fi for
    storing these input values in the database of the Web Server. The land is so vast
    that one sensor is not sufficient. For multiple sensors collecting the information,
    it is inconvenient to visualize the data and find the part of land corresponding
    to a particular sensor value. From the Web Server, the values can be fetched to
    display the sensor values over the output text panel in the AR camera through
    Vuforia on the CAD model of the land. In the recent times of COVID 19, the health
    monitoring of patients became so important. The pulse rate and oxygen levels are
    continuously monitored to avoid death. But it is harmful to the doctor to continuously
    monitor patients in the place of the hospital. The Internet of things and augmented
    reality can be utilized for monitoring the patient even if the doctor is far away.
    Using the wearable sensors, the health parameters like body temperature and pulse
    rate can be sensed and sent to the NodemCU which is connected to the Wi-Fi for
    storing these input values in the database of the Web server. A unique image target
    can be allotted to the patient. So, the Vuforia recognizes and displays the data
    fetched from the database over the output text panel in the AR camera. The maintenance
    of optimum tire pressure is crucial for avoiding road accidents. At high speed,
    if the tire blasts then there is a high chance of death. It is necessary to monitor
    the tire pressure periodically. Generally, it is done at the fuel stops. But people
    neglect to check it regularly. By maintaining the optimum tire pressure, the mileage
    and the life of the tire can be improved. With the use of AR and IoT, the driver
    can monitor every tire pressure of an automobile effortlessly. If there is a drastic
    drift from the set value, the driver can go to the fuel stop to fill the optimum
    pressure in the tires. With the help of a tire pressure sensor, the values are
    sensed and sent to the NodemCU which is connected to the WiFi for storing these
    input values in the database of the Web server. Generally, the car contains four
    tires. Using this process, the driver can visualize conveniently the exact tire
    corresponding to a particular output value without any confusion. SECTION II.
    Literature Survey Kumar et al. [1] analyzed the various Virtual Reality (VR) and
    Augmented Reality (AR) Technologies for providing a user-friendly experience of
    digital shopping. The full potential of AR and VR can be utilized in the field
    of retail and marketing industry. The market trends needed to be understood by
    both the technology provider and the retailer. Alonso-Rosa et al. [2] integrated
    the mobile Augmented reality (MAR) and IoT for visualization of Energy parameters
    in the building environments. Mobile can be used as an interface for AR to connect
    the physical and digital world with less usage of hardware for humans. Khan et
    al. [3] designed a pulse rate monitoring system using the Internet of things.
    Heart disease is dangerous. The pulse rate needs to be monitored periodically.
    The pulse rate senses and sends to the Arduino Uno which is connected to Bluetooth
    and sent to the smartphone. There the doctor can monitor the patient online using
    the Internet of Things. Stark et al. [4] proposed a solution for the detection
    of the three-dimensional Objects in AR instead of the conventional methods based
    on scanning QR codes for controlling and monitoring the mechatronic devices. It
    is cumbersome to monitor many IoT-connected machines with these conventional methods.
    AR can be utilized here to monitor them effortlessly. Pathak et al. [5] discussed
    Modern technologies like AR, IoT, Additive Manufacturing (AM) and their integration
    using the case studies. The combination of these technologies can automate the
    process of manufacturing more sustainably. But due to the digitalization of manufacturing,
    essential information such as STL data can be leaked. The security also needed
    to be upgraded Nugroho et al. [6] proposed a system for monitoring the volume
    of gasoline and pressure of the tire with the help of IoT using the mobile phone.
    The fuel meter voltage varies with the gasoline volume. The voltage of the pressure
    sensor also varies with the tire pressure. Using the ADC ports of NodemCU are
    connected to sensors for uploading the data to the cloud. Khan et al. [7] developed
    a system for health monitoring the COVID-19 patients. The temperature of the body,
    oxygen content, pulse rate needed to be determined regularly in real-time for
    the critical care of the COVID-19 patients. The Arduino Uno is used for acquiring
    the data from the sensors and stores the data in the cloud. The data is stored
    in the server so that the doctor can access and take the next step for treatment
    even if the doctor is far away. Nayyar et al. [8] developed a Smart IoT-based
    Agriculture Stick for detecting the soil Moisture, Temperature in various locations,
    and soil conditions in the field for maximum yield and good quality. Arduino is
    used for acquiring the data from the sensors and uploads to the cloud and can
    retrieve the information online with high accuracy. Ismail et al. [9] proposed
    a system for monitoring the composite panel which is sensitive to the temperature
    and humidity of surroundings. The Arduino acquires the data from the DHT11 temperature
    humidity sensor and sends it to the cloud. If any measurement goes out of control,
    then the warning system gets activated. Bose et al. [10] proposed a maintenance
    system for the safety of employees working in a harsh environment. The NodemCU
    microcontroller acquires the data in real-time from the gas sensor, temperature,
    and humidity sensor, smoke sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, and uploads to the Losant
    IoT Platform for visualizing and monitoring the data. Vidal-Balea et al. [11]
    proposed an application of AR that the users can experience the operate the clutch
    of the ship virtually, assemble the parts, provide documentation to every part
    of the ship, visualize and interact from multiple devices at the same time. Phupattanasilp
    et al. [12] utilized both Augmented reality and IoT to enhance precision farming.
    The multi-cameras are used to find the coordinates of the real-world objects accurately
    for placing the virtual objects on them to illustrate the IoT data for better
    visualization. SECTION III. Problem Formulation This paper aims to integrate the
    IoT and AR for the maintenance of the systems. If the data and IoT-connected machines
    are more, then it is cumbersome to visualize the data. This does not completely
    perceive the operator. For better visualization, better organization, better perception
    of the data to the user AR can be incorporated. This integration of AR and IoT
    can be applied in various domains. In this paper, some of the domains are chosen
    to describe the procedure and versatility of this methodology. SECTION IV. Methodology
    In the Vuforia developer website [11] a license key is created and an image target
    is needed to be uploaded. For effective detection of the image target by the Vuforia
    engine, the augmentable rating should be 5-stars rating. And the database is downloaded
    and imported to the workspace of Unity 3D. Next, the AR camera which is available
    in the Vuforia, in the section of “open Vuforia Engine Configuration” the app
    license key needs to be pasted which is available in the section of License manager
    in Vuforia developer website. The required CAD model needs to be imported to the
    Unity 3D environment. The 3D CAD file formats such as obj, fbx, etc. are supported.
    The necessary C# scripts need to be added as a component in any Game Object. The
    API web request is activated to obtain the cloud data from the Thing Speak website.
    This integration of AR and IoT can be applied to various domains for the seamless
    experience of data in various machine components. Fig. 1. The process of sending
    data from sensors to superimposition of data virtually over the real objects.
    Show All Fig. 1. Illustrates the data flow from NodeMCU to the end-user which
    is the heart of AR through IoT. The Write API key is given in the nodeMCU for
    updating the data to the cloud. NodeMCU processes the data and sends it to the
    Thing Speak Website using the Write API key every 15 sec. Read API key is to be
    given in the Unity C# script for making the Unity Web requests at every certain
    time interval to obtain the data from the cloud. Unity makes web requests using
    the read API key for every 1 min to the Thing Speak database to fetch the data
    to Unity. Table. 1. Illustrates Unity C# code for receiving data from cloud. Now
    Unity overlays this information in the Output text panel Game Object on the CAD
    model. An APK file is generated and this is installed on the mobile. After opening
    the app on the mobile, the Vuforia engine starts to detect the image target in
    the real world. Once detects, the CAD model and the Output text panel that shows
    the data overlays virtually over the image target. Finally, the user can visualize
    the temperature data through the mobile with better perception and organization.
    This methodology can be implemented in various domains. Table 1 Unity C# Code
    For Receiving Data From Cloud SECTION V. Implementation A. Monitoring the machines
    in Manufacturing Industry Fig.2. Temperature Sensing in machines in the real world
    a virtual content is created showing the sensor values Show All In the Manufacturing
    plant, many machines are doing the operations in the production of an object.
    The working performance of the Machines needed to be monitored every day for the
    long run of the machines. Novelty of Fig.2. is that the temperature data is virtually
    projected over the virtual CAD model in the real world after the detection of
    image target by the Vuforia Engine. The LM35 temperature sensor is used to find
    the temperature and send it to the NodeMCU. An image target is placed in front
    of the camera and the Vuforia engine detects it. The data can be placed over that
    image target. Finally, using the integration of Augmented reality and the Internet
    of things, the operator can visualize the temperature of the machine over the
    respective machine. Here in this case the CAD model [12] is imported to the Unity
    3D environment B. Irrigation in Agriculture Fig. 3. Soil Moisture sense: in the
    real world a virtual content is created showing the moisture values Show All The
    farmer has to know the soil moisture for the proper cultivation of crops. If there
    is an imbalance in the soil moisture, there is an effect on the growth of the
    crop. The farmer needs to properly irrigate the cropland evenly. So that all plants
    will get equal exposure to moisture. The soil moisture sensors can be used to
    detect the moisture in the cropland and can be given to the NodemCU. Similarly,
    with the help of Wi-Fi, the data can be uploaded to the Cloud and the farmer can
    visualize the data of soil moisture of the cropland. For detecting the moisture
    of the whole cropland, the land can be divided into domains. And each sensor is
    placed in that domain for finding the soil moisture at the domain. Finally, using
    the integration of Augmented reality and the Internet of things, the farmer can
    visualize the land virtually in addition to the sensor data displayed over the
    respective domains of the field. Here in this case the CAD model [13] is imported
    to the Unity 3D environment. C. Health monitoring Fig. 4. Health Monitoring Show
    All The SpO2 Pulse Sensor is used for determining the pulse rate and DS18B20 Sensor
    is used for temperature sensing. A unique image target can be allotted to the
    patient. So, the Vuforia recognizes and displays the data fetched from the database
    over the output text panel in the AR camera. The patient’s health can be monitored
    virtually on top of the real objects due to the integration of AR and IoT. An
    image target is placed in front of the camera and the Vuforia engine detects it.
    The data can be placed over that image target. Health information like the body
    temperature and pulse rate can be obtained through sensors and these can be uploaded
    to the cloud. These using restful APIs the information with the integration of
    AR can be displayed virtually over the real objects. D. Tire Pressure Monitoring
    in Automobile Fig. 5. Tyre pressure sensing in Automobile: In the real world of
    a house, a virtual content having an automobile and actual sensor data is shown
    Show All Similarly, by applying the same procedure to this also the data can be
    placed over that image target lively. Tire pressure measuring sensors can be used.
    Fig.5. illustrates the pressure data virtually over the virtual CAD model in the
    real world after the detection of the image target by the Vuforia Engine. Four
    tire pressure sensors can be put to every tire and send the data to NodeMCU. This
    data goes to the cloud and then the Unity Output panel Game object. Finally, the
    user can visualize the data over the image target with mobile conveniently. Here
    in this case the CAD model [14] is imported to the Unity 3D environment. Tyre
    pressure monitoring is crucial in avoiding road accidents, enhancing mileage,
    and improving tire life. With the use of AR and IoT, the driver can monitor every
    tire pressure of an automobile effortlessly. SECTION VI. Conclusion If there is
    more than one sensor kept at different places of the machine, by uploading the
    data to the cloud, the IoT data obtained cannot be conveniently perceived by the
    user. To visualize conveniently AR can be used to view the data over the real-world
    objects and this allows interactions between user and computer. In addition to
    this, the sensor data can be huge; to showcase it properly this integration of
    IoT and AR can be utilized. So, using Augmented reality the IoT data can be displayed
    at that place of the sensor in the CAD model of that machine. That CAD model with
    the IoT data corresponding to each sensor can be superimposed in the mobile camera
    video of the user. Now the user can conveniently find the IoT data corresponding
    to a particular sensor in the machine. For this, the Vuforia SDK can be used in
    the Unity 3D environment. Using Restful API calls from the Cloud server like Thing
    Speak the IoT data can be brought to Unity. Authors Figures References Citations

    freshwater is escalating with the increasing food demand of a fast-growing population.
    The agriculture sector of Pakistan contributes to 26% of its GDP and employs 43%
    of the entire labor force. However, the currently used traditional farming methods
    such as flood irrigation and rotating water allocation system (Warabandi) results
    in excess and untimely water usage, as well as low crop yield. Internet of things

    The objective of this study was to compare and optimize water usage in a 2-acre

    crop coefficient 1. Introduction Agriculture is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy,
    which contributes 26% of the country’s GDP and employs 43% of the total labor
    force [1]. The support of agriculture currently uses 60% of the total freshwater
    drawings [2]; 90% of land cultivation is achieved by irrigation using river water,
    and this contributes to over 80% of agricultural yield. However, the average rainfall
    is less than 240 mm a year [3], and it is estimated that the country may run dry
    by 2025 [4]. The climatic changes and high population growth (1.57% per year)
    in Pakistan require more water resources, not only for daily usage but also for
    agriculture [5]. However, the majority of farmers use outdated irrigation methods,
    such as flood irrigation, and rely on estimations for decision making in agricultural
    practices which typically result in excess water usage [6]. Additionally, a fixed
    rotational water allocation system, known as Warabandi, is used in the region
    for supplying irrigation water to farmers as per a preplanned schedule [7]. In
    this method, pre-allocated fixed volumes of irrigation water (estimated according
    to the crop) is provided into canals leading up to the fields, on a given day
    [8]. This method is widely used in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and some of the
    Mediterranean region [8,9]. This practice, although providing equitable water
    supply for all farmers in the region (which, otherwise, could result in conflicts
    over water usage) does not incorporate the actual irrigation requirements as per
    the field parameters on a given day. It provides access to water, at set times,
    but not all the time. This can result in untimely and excessive irrigation of
    the fields. Excess irrigation not only depletes already scarce freshwater resources,
    but it also affects the crop quality. The additional water in the soil reduces
    the necessary space required for plant respiration, which consequently hinders
    plant growth [10]. Excess water in the soil can also lead to salinity problems,
    which affects the fertility of the soil, thus reducing the available arable land
    [11]. Irrigation is highly dependent on three major factors—crop type, weather,
    and soil—that significantly affect the irrigation scheduling criteria [12]. Crop
    type and soil determines the volume of irrigation and fertilizers, whereas weather,
    soil moisture, humidity, and temperature govern the schedule of irrigation. Ultimately,
    the irrigation water requirements for crops change dynamically each year [13].
    Thus, it is necessary to implement a scheduled irrigation policy for crops on
    the basis of these real time parameters for smart water management and high-quality
    crop yields [14]. Data-driven irrigation scheduling systems comprise two integral
    parts—dynamic models (based on weather, crop, and soil data) and an agriculture
    decision support system (DSS). The agriculture DSS analyzes the data, makes decisions
    based on real-time inputs of the soil, and approximates the time for the next
    irrigation. A DSS that uses machine learning for irrigation water management was
    presented in [15], and a study for decision systems and its use in water management
    was presented by Guariso et al. in [16]. The real-time calculation of the soil–water
    balance is essential for real-time irrigation scheduling. Real-time computations
    require the prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo), which is the
    basis for estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and for computing crop irrigation
    requirements [17]. The FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) method is recommended as the
    standard ETo method [18] and it has long been accepted worldwide as a good ETo
    estimator when compared with other methods [19,20,21]. Using ET0, the daily soil
    water deficit is then calculated on the basis of the soil water balance equation,
    which is a widely used irrigation scheduling method [22]. With the advent of the
    Internet of things (IoT), the availability of real-time weather and in situ soil
    data has revolutionized decision making for farmers in the agriculture sector.
    The estimations made by the IoT-based agriculture DSS are more accurate than human
    estimation as they are based on an accurate analysis of variable real-time data
    [23]. IoT-based and wireless sensor network (WSN)-based monitoring and decision
    making for irrigation systems have accurately predicted irrigation scheduling
    in the past using measured data, thereby increasing water productivity [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34].
    To date, various applications have explored the implementation of IoT-based DSS
    for scheduling irrigation in farms. Some studies used the soil water-based equation,
    while others used the soil moisture threshold method [17]. In [29], a system was
    developed with a cloud-based framework for irrigation in an urban setting for
    a multilevel plant pot. Each node contained a local decision-making system along
    with sensors and actuators. The local nodes communicated the data to the cloud
    through a central node, where data could be analyzed. The experiment, though a
    small-scale testbed, showed reduced water consumption. Machine learning was employed
    in another 3-week study [24] for an IoT-based irrigation management system on
    a small test bed. The system included embedded microcontroller base boards (Raspberry
    Pi and an Arduino) to recommend the irrigation requirements of a field using the
    predicted soil moisture value. The prediction algorithm used ground parameters
    such as soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with
    the weather forecast data from the Internet. The study demonstrated predictions
    of good accuracy (R2 = 96%) but did not analyze the water savings. The device
    was also not robust enough to be deployed in a harsh and remote environment. The
    studies in [24,25,28] also proposed IoT-based irrigation scheduling systems and
    deployed them on a pilot scale. The systems were based on direct soil water measurement
    to utilize water optimally compared to traditional irrigation systems. Another
    study [33] focused on smart irrigation scheduling for tunnel farming. The researchers
    used sensors to acquire light, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture readings
    which were calibrated to deploy fuzzy logic and generate results that determined
    whether and when the crop requires water. The readings were forwarded to the server
    where they could be accessed and viewed by an Android (a popular and standardized
    mobile operating system from Google) application or a web browser. This study
    was unique as it focused on tunnel farming, deployed fuzzy logic to make smart
    decisions for scheduling, and saved energy consumption by controlling active times
    of sensors. A DSS for automatic irrigation scheduling based on machine learning
    methods was analyzed in a study in Spain [35]. The study was aimed toward testing
    different machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, support vector
    machine, and random forest regression, for predicting irrigation values. The models
    were trained on agronomical data acquired from nine citrus orchards of 5–6 ha
    area each. For that, nodes developed by a smart solutions company were used. Weather
    data such as temperature, humidity, radiation, wind speed, rainfall, and vapor
    pressure were provided by a public research institute in Spain, which deployed
    49 climate stations covering the region under study. The study showed weekly average
    error below 10% for the predictions in comparison to the values recommended by
    the agronomist. Another research study for lemon farming was conducted using an
    IoT device, in which soil moisture threshold values were used to trigger irrigation.
    The system included a hardware node based on a microcontroller unit, DHT22 sensor
    (temperature and humidity), and a soil moisture sensor along with a mobile application
    and a web portal. According to threshold values of soil moisture, the farmer can
    decide to irrigate the field. The study was actually aimed at finding the relationship
    between humidity and temperature on crop yield on the basis of season-long collected
    data, for which a linear regression model was used. It was determined that the
    suitable temperature and humidity for high productivity of homegrown lemons was
    29–32 °C and 72–81%, respectively. Most of the earlier studies were small-scale
    pilot deployments and were not able to evaluate the impact of smart irrigation
    on total water savings and crop yields over a season. Furthermore, none of the
    studies were based on flood irrigation, which offers its own limitations. Moreover,
    Pakistan uses a traditional rotational water allocation method, Warabandi, which
    puts limitations on water scheduling and needs to be considered for the DSS. Some
    studies used public weather data, while others used weather data to predict soil
    moisture to schedule irrigation. There are various commercial IoT modules available
    for irrigation scheduling such as CropX sensor [36], Teralytic sensor [37], Mark2
    sensor [38], and Libelium Kit [39]. The cost of these systems ranges from 1000
    to 5000 USD. CropX measures soil moisture, soil temperature, and electrical conductivity
    at multiple depths of soil, as well as weather conditions [36]. It has its own
    communication modules and works as a standalone component. It costs about 600
    USD and has shown water savings of up to 30%. The Teralytic sensor probe along
    with installation kit and gateway costs up to 4300 USD [37]. It measures soil
    NPK (nitrate, phosphates, potassium) levels, soil pH, soil moisture, soil temperature,
    and weather parameters. The sensor probe cannot work independently and requires
    the associated hub for data transfer. No published results could be found as per
    the authors’ best knowledge to demonstrate water savings using this device. The
    Mark2 sensor has similar features to the above modules and costs about 1600 USD
    [38]. The Libelium agriculture kit measures soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    leaf wetness, and atmospheric pressure [39]. It also comes with a data visualization
    software. This kit costs 5000 USD, which includes nodes and a hub. The available
    tools and systems discussed above are not cost-effective, which increases the
    dependency of the users on imported solutions, which makes maintenance challenging.
    Hence, there is a requirement for a low-cost indigenously developed IoT device
    to address the specific regional requirements. The proposed study represents the
    country’s first commercial smart irrigation system. Due to indigenous development,
    the system is likely to be maintained at lower cost against the imported solutions
    which are expensive to maintain. Such a system must utilize in situ soil moisture
    data, as well as real-time weather data, for estimating crop water requirements,
    and this is what we report on in this paper. In this paper, we present the results
    of a 9-month long study on a 2-acre lemon farm, where the indigenously developed
    IoT device was deployed and monitored. The field was compared with a similar 2-acre
    lemon farm, where traditional farmer-controlled irrigation scheduling was used.
    Lemons, unlike rice and sugarcane, are not a water-intensive plant; hence, this
    offers significant scope for achieving water saving over traditional lemon farming
    techniques in the region. The real-time field and weather data were collected
    through a self-designed sensor node. An information visualization feature and
    DSS system was developed for both a mobile application and a web portal for the
    ease of the farmers to keep track of their crops and their water requirements.
    The novel agriculture DSS algorithm uses collected data to calculate daily grass
    reference evapotranspiration (ET0), crop coefficients (Kc), and daily crop evapotranspiration
    ETc. The algorithm calculates soil water depletion and total water availability
    and recommends an irrigation schedule to the farmers, keeping in view the Warabandi
    system. Our study is novel in the sense that no other research in the region has
    targeted complete design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of a self-designed
    low-cost IoT system based DSS solution (under 100 USD) for irrigation scheduling
    and crop yield monitoring for an entire season. Furthermore, no study has focused
    on the Warabandi system of irrigation. The authors have extensive research experience
    with regard to smart irrigation using IoT solutions and environmental modeling
    for farm water management [30,31,40]. The developed product was launched in a
    start-up company as a service and is being adopted by many farmers in the country
    for crop monitoring and irrigation scheduling [41]. 2. Materials and Methods Our
    study highlights the difference between conventional irrigation and agriculture
    DSS-based irrigation. The study was conducted on a 4-acre farm in Gadap, Karachi,
    from February 2018 to October 2018 (9 months) on a lemon orchard. In total, 4
    acres of land was used for the trial: 2 acres reserved for farmer-controlled irrigation
    (Area A) and 2 acres reserved for agriculture DSS-controlled irrigation (Area
    B), as shown in Figure 1. Flood irrigation was used in both the areas. Area A
    was irrigated as a function of the traditional estimations made by the farmers
    for irrigation time and volume, whereas Area B was irrigated using the recommendations
    made by the agriculture DSS as a function of real-time information provided by
    the deployed IoT device. Figure 1. Area A for farmer estimations (2 acres); Area
    B for agriculture DSS recommendations (2 acres). 2.1. Implementation Detail The
    bespoke IoT device (as shown in Figure 2), developed by the authors, was used
    in Area B to monitor soil and weather data in real time. The application uses
    third-party wind data (m/s) from online sources [42]. A DHT22 sensor [43] is embedded
    in the IoT device to collect temperature and humidity, and the frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) soil moisture sensor [44] measures the soil moisture at 30
    cm depth. The details of the IoT device are covered in the next section. Figure
    2. IoT device. Before the final deployment at the beginning of the season in February,
    the system was developed and tested at the study site for about 4 months. Information
    related to soil, crop, and irrigation system was gathered with the help of expert
    farmers and incorporated in the DSS algorithm (discussed in the next section).
    The IoT device is enclosed in a hardware box to be securely deployed on the site.
    During initial testing, two devices were deployed in the 2-acre field to provide
    spatial resolution for data. However, due to no variability in soil parameters
    and weather conditions, as well as a leveled land for the test site and crop,
    observed parameters by the sensors did not vary. Hence, it was decided to only
    use a single a device for monitoring. The final results in terms of irrigation
    savings and yield increase validated our decision. Therefore, scalability is not
    applicable in our case; more sensors would only be needed if soil and weather
    parameters are likely to change on the given site. The cost of a single IoT device
    is 65 USD for the farmers to purchase. The total cost of a single device, as well
    as its deployment, testing, and maintenance, for an entire season comes to about
    170 USD. This includes the cloud service charges and access to the mobile application,
    web portal, and SMS service. Once the system is deployed, the collected data from
    the sensors are sent to an online server by the device, where the agriculture
    DSS uses these data to calculate water requirements. For irrigation scheduling
    in DSS, the widely used method of evapotranspiration/water balance (ET-WB) is
    applied, in which daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is estimated according to
    the methods outlined by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [22]. Daily soil
    water deficit is calculated using the ET-WB equation to schedule irrigation events
    when the total water depletion exceeds the readily available water. The FAO-56
    Penman–Monteith equation is used to calculate daily grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0). ETc is estimated using FAO-56 Dual Crop Coefficient procedures [18]. All
    this information is made available to the farmer using a mobile application and
    a web portal. These values are then used by the farmer to schedule irrigation
    for Area B. Where mobile service is not available, farmers are informed using
    an SMS message about irrigation scheduling and field status. The farmers make
    use of the existing infrastructure for irrigating their field. After the 9-month
    study, the research was able to record and compare the total farm yield, yield
    per tree, revenue, and total water usage of both the farm areas, as discussed
    in Section 3. Below, we discuss the design architecture including the IoT device
    and DSS algorithm, irrigation calculation methods, and the output parameters.
    2.2. Design Architecture The comprehensive framework of the system, shown in Figure
    3, illustrates the system input coming through the deployed IoT device in the
    farm (soil moisture, temperature, humidity), satellite data (wind speed and direction),
    and predefined data (crop type, soil type, location, plantation date). Figure
    3. Overall architecture of agriculture-based DSS. The collected data are presented
    to the DSS using an underlying intelligent algorithm, which recommends the irrigation
    scheduling for the farm. The figure further illustrates the mobile application
    interface presented to the farmers to analyze the farm parameters and to get feedback
    on the irrigation requirement. We now discuss the two basic sections of the architecture—the
    IoT device and the DSS algorithm. 2.2.1. IoT Device The IoT node incorporates
    a power source, microcontroller, sensors, and RF transceiver for this application,
    as shown in Figure 4. Various sensors are used. The DHT 22 sensor and soil moisture
    sensor are used to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment, and
    the water content of the soil, respectively. All the sensors are interfaced with
    high-performance, low-power AVR series microcontrollers ATmega8/ATmega328. The
    pins of the controller are interfaced with sensors and the RF transceiver, through
    the serial port. The GSM/GPRS module is used for communication purposes and to
    send the recorded data to the cloud. A separate board for providing the sensors
    power was created. A 9 V lithium battery is used to provide the power. The battery
    capacity is 2000 mAh but the primary supply is from an 18 W solar cell. The battery
    allows a lifetime of 2 days without charging. It is regulated by a 78H05K regulator
    to maintain the voltage at 5 V for the microcontroller, which then further lowers
    the voltage to 3.3 V for the RF transceiver. Figure 4. IoT device architecture.
    The device was placed in a plastic box under the solar panel for protection from
    the harsh weather conditions in a farm, which, in previous cases, affected the
    circuitry and casing of the device. However, the sensors were able to perform
    under the harsh weather conditions as the temperature peaked at 52 °C in the summer.
    The custom PCB of the IoT device is shown in Figure 5. The readings of temperature,
    soil moisture, and humidity were recorded by the sensors once per hour in a day
    and the data were sent to a cloud analytics platform service called ThingSpeak
    via the GSM module (SIM800 L). ThingSpeak is a cloud platform that aggregates
    and visualizes the data sent from devices (or sensors) [45]. This device can be
    used on any crop without any changes in the structure as the device is used for
    data acquisition. The collected data are then fed into the online DSS that combines
    the soil and weather data with crop data, which ultimately results in estimating
    the water requirements of the crop. Multiple devices can be installed on different
    crops at the same time without any change in the hardware design to collect the
    soil and weather data. The backend software deployed on an online server represents
    the crop’s predefined data for each device so that the system can accommodate
    all the crops if their predefined data are available. Figure 5. IoT PCB. 2.2.2.
    DSS Algorithm The DSS algorithm determines if irrigation is required by the farmer
    or not, and how much irrigation volume is needed. The overall flow of the DSS
    algorithm is illustrated in Figure 6. The agriculture DSS functions on two types
    of data: real-time and predefined. The sensors present in the IoT device measure
    real-time ambient temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data. The values from
    the sensor are dynamic as they change every hour. These hourly updated values
    from the sensors are necessary for the agriculture DSS to make accurate decisions.
    Furthermore, the DSS uses third-party monthly average wind data (m/s) from an
    online source for the Gadap region [42]. The wind parameters are required to calculate
    ET0 but do not need to be measured on the node as they are available from online
    sources. Figure 6. DSS algorithm. Some predefined static data are used in the
    system, such as crop data, soil data, and location data. Crop data include crop
    coefficient, effective root depth, and planting date. Soil data include soil type,
    soil water capacity, and wilting point. Location data include longitude and latitude
    of the field. These values are preset prior to installing the device in the field
    and are essential for the agriculture DSS to optimally schedule irrigation. To
    assess if the irrigation is needed on a given day, there is a fundamental condition
    recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [22] which is checked in
    the DSS algorithm daily: if Dr,i ≥ RAW, irrigation is needed, where Dr,I is the
    root zone depletion at the end of the i-th day (mm) and RAW is the readily available
    water in the root zone (mm). This is the fundamental equation for the decision
    support system to daily calculate the irrigation decision for a particular area
    and crop. Dr,i is referred to as final depletion in this research. RAW represents
    the amount of water that must be maintained above final depletion value to avoid
    crop water stress and ensure proper crop growth. RAW is calculated using ETc and
    predefined crop data. Every day, the two most critical values (depletion before
    evapotranspiration (initial depletion) and depletion after evapotranspiration
    (final depletion)) are calculated using field water capacity, mean soil moisture,
    and effective root depth information. The depletion values increase each day due
    to crop evapotranspiration. Eventually, depletion rises above the value of RAW,
    which means that irrigation is needed. The crop suffers if depletion remains greater
    than RAW. For ETc and ETc calculations, the Penman–Monteith model and crop coefficient
    approach are used, respectively (discussed later in detail). As Figure 6 illustrates,
    ETo is calculated using daily temperature, daily humidity, wind speed, and location
    information (latitude and latitude). Once the above irrigation condition is true,
    the value of RAW and the total area covered by all the lemon trees are used to
    determine the required irrigation volume. The algorithm determines the duration
    (in minutes) as per the given water flow for irrigating a specific area. As mentioned
    earlier, the Warabandi system is a rotational water allocation mechanism through
    which a fixed amount of water is supplied to each farmer on a given day. Hence,
    the irrigation DSS must take into account the limitations offered by the system
    and recommend irrigation according to the farmer’s turn without affecting crop
    health. As a result, the DSS system informs farmers to irrigate crops when the
    requirement for water is nearest to their turn. For example, if the agriculture
    DSS calculates that a crop requires water on Monday, but the turn of the farmer
    is on Friday, then the agriculture DSS will tell the farmer in advance to irrigate
    the crop on the previous Friday. Irrigating the crop on the previous Friday, before
    Monday, would be necessary to prevent wilting beyond Monday. Currently, no other
    organization or individual has developed a similar algorithm. Thus, the prediction
    algorithm in the DSS is novel and unique. 2.3. Irrigation Calculation Methods
    For controlled irrigation, it is necessary to determine the amount of water the
    crop loses during a period, as well as the amount the crop requires. Water requirement
    changes with every crop type and region; however, there are two means by which
    water loss occurs. The first is evaporation of the water from the soil. The second
    is transpiration from the plant. Therefore, it is important to calculate how evaporation
    and transpiration (or evapotranspiration) affect the plant. Evapotranspiration
    is a combination of both terms, and this research focuses on calculating evapotranspiration
    as it allows researchers to efficiently estimate the water requirement of crops.
    2.3.1. Penman–Monteith The Penman–Monteith equation [46] (Equation (1)) is an
    effective method for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0). ET 0
    = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+Υ 900 T + 273 u 2 ( e s − e a ) Δ+Υ(1+0.34 u 2 ) , (1) where
    ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration (mm per day), Rn is the net radiation
    at the crop surface (MJ/m2 per day), G is the soil heat flux density (MH/m2 per
    day), T is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height (°C), u2 is the wind speed
    at 2 m height (m/s), es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea is the actual
    vapor pressure (kPa), es − ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit (kPa),
    Δ is the slope of vapor pressure curve (kPa per °C), and γ is the psychrometric
    constant (kPa per °C). The sensor provides the ambient temperature (T), and soil
    moisture. The remaining values are determined as described below. Net Radiation
    (Rn) Rn is the radiation at the surface that can increase the accuracy of estimation
    if available. The value of Rn is calculated from publicly available libraries
    that implement an estimation formula, namely, meteolib [47] and FAO [48]. Different
    parameters are taken into consideration such as maximum and minimum values of
    temperature, latitude, and longitude to determine the final value of Rn. Soil
    Heat Flux (G) The amount of thermal energy that moves through an area of soil
    per unit time is called the soil heat flux [46]. The agriculture DSS calculates
    ETo every 24 h, and the value of soil heat flux is so small that it is considered
    to be negligible. Therefore, soil heat flux is G ≈ 0. Wind Speed (u2) u 2 = u
    z 4.87 ln(67.8z−5.42) , (2) where z is the elevation above sea level (m). FAO
    recommends keeping the sensors at 10 m above the surface because wind speed is
    lowest at ground level and increases with height. Therefore, anemometers are placed
    at a standard height, i.e., 10 m in meteorology and 2 or 3 m in agrometeorology.
    In this case, the altitude must be 2 m in the equation for best outcomes, and
    the dataset was recorded with wind speed at 10 m. This applies to the third-party
    wind datasets that were used for the calculation [42]. Saturation Vapor Pressure
    (es) Saturation vapor pressure, required in Equation (1), is calculated as shown
    in Equation (3). e s = e o ( T max )+ e o ( T min ) 2 , (3) where T is the temperature
    (°C) and e0 (T) is the saturation vapor pressure at the air temperature T (kPa).
    e 0 (T)=0.6108exp[ 17.27T T+237.3 ]. (4) Equation (4) shows nonlinearity in computing
    the desired outcomes. Therefore, mean saturation vapor pressure is calculated
    for a day, month, or week at the mean maximum and minimum temperatures for a specific
    period of time. Actual Vapor Pressure (ea) ea is calculated as shown in Equation
    (5). e a = e 0 ( T max ) RH max 100 + e 0 ( T min ) RH min 100 2 , (5) where T
    is the temperature (°C). Vapor Pressure Curve (Δ) Δ is determined using Equation
    (6). Δ= 4098[0.618exp( 17.27T T+237.3 )] (T+237.3) 2 , (6) where T is the temperature
    (°C). Psychometric Constant (γ) The psychrometric constant, γ, is defined by the
    value of atmospheric pressure as shown in Equation (7), which is calculated using
    Equation (8). γ is related to the evapotranspiration from leaves, the rate of
    which is dependent on atmospheric pressure. γ=0.665× 10 −3 P, (7) where P is the
    atmospheric pressure (mb), as given by Equation (8). P=101.3 ( 293−0.0065z 293
    ) 5.26 , (8) where z is the altitude above sea level (m). 2.3.2. Crop Coefficient
    Approach The evapotranspiration, ET0, calculated using Penman–Monteith equation
    is used to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration, ETc. Each crop has
    a unique evapotranspiration; therefore, the Penman–Monteith equation assigns ET0
    to each crop. ET0 depends on real-time and predefined data. It considers variables
    such as wind, humidity, altitude, and latitude. Therefore, it uses a diverse dataset
    that includes real-time and predefined data. To calculate ETc, the crop coefficient
    approach is used as shown in Equation (9). ET c = K c  ET 0 , (9) where Kc refers
    to crop coefficient, which is specific to various crops and their growth stages.
    For lemon, these values range between 0.6 and 0.8 according to FAO for various
    crop stages, changing with time [18]. 2.4. System Outputs The agriculture DSS
    provides the farmer with multiple options with respect to the irrigation output
    variable, as well as the user application interface. The user application interface
    includes a mobile application and a web portal. 2.4.1. Output Parameter Options
    for Irrigation The agriculture DSS offers flexibility to farmers to use different
    output parameters for irrigation as per their requirement. Some farmers calculate
    irrigation output in terms of volume, such as gallons or liters. Other farmers
    use acre per inch irrigation calculations. Furthermore, some farmers cannot calculate
    the volume or acre per inch, and they use time as an output. Therefore, the agriculture
    DSS provides the option for various output parameters to the farmers as per their
    requirement. For example, if farmers use time as an output term, then the system
    will tell them to irrigate for a specific duration. The terms of output do not
    affect the actual requirement of the crop. For example, if a crop requires 5 L
    of water, then the system delivers 5 L of water, whether the output is in volume,
    time, or acre per inch. It adjusts the output according to the required output
    term; it calculates how much time or acre per inch is equal to 5 L of water, and
    then shows the correct output amount to the farmer. Therefore, the agriculture
    DSS can work on any farm in Pakistan, with varying irrigation output parameter
    requirements. 2.4.2. Mobile Application and Web Portal An easy-to-navigate user
    interface is fundamental to promoting a technical farming solution for farmers
    in Pakistan. With the availability of mobile phones, information sharing has become
    more prevalent. Hence, for the agriculture DSS, a custom mobile application was
    developed to inform the farmers about the status of their crop using real-time
    data, as shown in Figure 7. The registered farmers can log into their account
    and access information related to the irrigation requirements of their farm. The
    application represents irrigation output parameters set as per the farmer’s preference.
    Different parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature,
    and irrigation requirement are included on the main page of the application. The
    application alerts the farmer when irrigation is required at the farm. Farmers
    irrigate the crops according to irrigation output and schedule in the mobile application.
    In addition, an SMS alert service is also available for farmers who do not own
    a smartphone. The SMS alert service sends text messages to farmers informing about
    the irrigation requirement (volume and time). Moreover, a web portal is available
    for information access. There are two interfaces for the portal: admin and user.
    The admin interface is used by the research team to view data for all the farmers,
    whereas the user interface is for the farmer. Therefore, the user interface of
    the agriculture DSS addresses the personalized requirements of each farmer. Figure
    7. (a) Android application and (b) web portal for information visualization for
    the farmer. 3. Results and Discussion During the 9-month study for the selected
    lemon orchard, the irrigation quantities applied as per the farmer estimates using
    the traditional method in Area A and as per the DSS algorithm in Area B were recorded.
    At the end of the season, lemon yield was also estimated in both farm areas to
    assess the impact of both irrigation methods. 3.1. Comparison of Irrigation Volume
    for Traditional and Agriculture DSS Methods Table 1 shows the total irrigation
    volume used in both areas. As indicated, Area A, irrigated using the traditional
    farming method, utilized 96,569 L of irrigation water in the entire season. On
    the other hand, Area B, irrigated using the DSS algorithm, utilized only 44,290
    L, which is 46% of the irrigation water used by the traditional method. In other
    terms, irrigation scheduled by the DSS algorithm saved 22,810,839 cubic feet of
    water. This establishes that irrigation scheduled using the DSS algorithm, based
    on real-time farm parameters, optimizes the use of available resources and saves
    water without affecting crop yield. In addition, it was observed that the crop
    yield was in fact increased, as discussed later. Table 1. Irrigation statistics
    (L). Table 2 lists the detailed irrigation schedule for both farms according to
    their application as per the day of the year and the water usage. Day 01 denotes
    1 January of the year. As normal in the traditional irrigation method, the farmer
    irrigated the area irrespective of the actual requirement. On the other hand,
    since real-time sensor data were used to calculate water requirements in Area
    B, the DSS algorithm did not recommend irrigation when not needed. This data are
    also plotted in Figure 8 to illustrate the water usage efficiency. Figure 8. Water
    usage efficiency of traditional and DSS algorithm-based irrigation systems. Table
    2. Water usage efficiency by comparing irrigation frequency and amount of traditional
    and sensor-based system. 3.2. Yield Increase Table 3 shows the resulting total
    yield at the end of the season in both farming areas (A and B). As is evident
    from the table, the lemon yield was much higher at 91 kg lemons per tree in Area
    B, which was irrigated as per recommendation by the DSS algorithm based on real-time
    parameters. In comparison, yield was at 67 kg per lemon tree in area A irrigated
    by traditional farming method. In short, the yield increased by 35% using DSS
    algorithm-based irrigation. The table further mentions that the total yield per
    acre in Area A as 4690 kg and that in Area B was 6370 kg. The total revenue generated
    in Area B (DSS algorithm-based irrigation) based on water saving and higher yield
    was 182,000 PKR, which was 35% higher than that in Area A (traditional irrigation).
    The farmers in Area B were delighted by the positive results of the IoT device
    and the associated DSS algorithm as they achieved 35% higher yield of lemons while
    consuming 50% less irrigation water. Figure 9 summarizes the results of crop yield
    and irrigation volume used in both the farm areas. Figure 9. Yield increase for
    lemon crop. Table 3. Yield increase for lemon crop. 3.3. Future Prospects The
    comparison study in Figure 9 shows the difference in irrigation by traditional
    farming and agriculture DSS; accordingly, in the future, these results could help
    in increasing the annual production of lemons all around the country. The area
    of cultivation for the citrus fruits in total is around 185,400 hectares (458,133
    acres) in Pakistan. Moreover, 97.16% of the citrus fruits are cultivated in the
    province of Punjab, occupying an area of 183,200 hectares (452,697 acres) producing
    2,097,700 tons annually [49]. Lemon represents about 1.2% of the total citrus
    fruit production in the Punjab, occupying an area of 4600 hectares (11,366.85
    acres) and producing 2600 tons annually. Overall, the total area given over to
    lemon production in Pakistan is approximately 5000 hectares (12,355 acres) on
    70 trees per acre. As indicated in our results, the traditional irrigation method
    typically generates 67 kg of lemon per tree; thus, 70 trees per acre could produce
    4690 kg of lemon/acre. Table 4 shows a summary of potential savings according
    to the results for our trial. Although based on a single trial, the savings are
    significant and further savings could even be made if the technique is extended
    to other citrus crops. Table 4. Yield increase for annual cultivation of lemon
    crop in Pakistan. Specifically, for this trial, the agriculture DSS significantly
    improved the yield of each tree, giving an improvement of 35%, notably achieving
    this by using 50% less water. In many ways, this water saving is the most important
    point because it may allow more traditionally unsuitable land to be exploited
    for production, without increasing the overall water usage. 4. Conclusions Excessive
    irrigation is a major agricultural problem. It reduces the quality of some crops
    and reduces the crop yield, while wasting a scarce resource. Farmers in developing
    countries often irrigate excessively due to their ignorance of the problems of
    water logging and salinity. In most cases, with the exception of water-intensive
    crops, crops need only an adequate amount of water to grow. Additional water destroys
    the root growth and decreases the water security of a region. To address this,
    an IoT device was developed and paired with a DSS for irrigation scheduling of
    a lemon orchard in Gadap, Karachi. The agriculture DSS scheduled irrigation according
    to data collected from the sensors embedded in the device; soil and crop data
    are pre-fed to the device, whereas weather data are collected real time. The Penman–Monteith
    equation and crop coefficient approach are an essential part of the system and
    form the basis of a prediction system. Furthermore, the system was adjusted according
    to the Warabandi system practised in Sindh, Pakistan. The final results in the
    form of a comparative study showed that the DSS was successful. It saved 52,280
    L of water on the farm while boosting the harvest by producing 1680 kg more lemon
    per acre, i.e., 35% greater turnout while preserving 50% irrigation water. Therefore,
    it is an effective system that increases water productivity for the tested crop;
    with slight adjustments, it could be simply applied to other non-water-intensive
    crops. As mentioned earlier, the developed product was launched in a start-up
    company as a service and is being adopted by many farmers in the country for crop
    monitoring and irrigation scheduling, providing evidence of the need for such
    a system. We intend to report further results as the system gains usage in more
    situations. Author Contributions Conceptualization, methodology, A.R., M.K., H.Z.;

    In arid and semi-arid zones, such as the southeast of Spain, the agriculture yield
    is conditioned by limiting factors, the main one being the available irrigation
    water. Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) techniques allow controlling the water
    applied to the crop in critical and non-critical phenological stages, determining
    periods where the crop can be irrigated with much less water. Therefore, these
    techniques have been widely used in these areas where water is a scarce resource
    [1,2,3]. However, the application of RDI strategies is conditioned by crop and
    climatic conditions. The development of irrigation models specifically designed
    for a crop would allow the application of RDI for water optimization purposes.
    In order to develop these models, it is necessary to carry out several comparative
    tests on different areas of the same crop, where the conditions of the applied
    RDI are modified. By studying the production and soil and plant water relations
    on trees subjected to the different treatments, it is possible to determine the
    most appropriate models for optimal irrigation management. In order to establish
    these RDI models, sensors that report on the state of the soil, plant and atmosphere
    are required. In addition, to achieve sufficient precision, it is important to
    have several repetitions of the measurements deploying different deficit irrigation
    regimes to obtain relations among the agronomic results and the water stress indicators
    studied [4,5,6]. Sensor networks are widely used when a high density of instrumentation
    is required on test plots. In the particular case of wireless sensor networks
    (WSN), their usefulness has been demonstrated in different papers [7,8,9,10],
    where the absence of wiring has resulted in a very important improvement in terms
    of installation flexibility and time savings in installation and maintenance.
    Several protocols have been described in the bibliography for the deployment of
    WSN in precision agriculture (PA) [11,12]. Zigbee is one of the most commonly
    used technologies in recent years with positive results [13,14,15,16,17,18], although
    it is claimed that ZigBee communication has the problem of short distance, complicated
    networking and high communication frequency [19]. From the experience of our research
    group in previous installations, in which we deployed WSNs with Zigbee nodes [20,21,22,23],
    we found significant drawbacks such as the high maintenance required by the nodes,
    the difficulty of programming the Zigbee stack, the high price of the software
    licenses and the limited availability of microcontrollers that supported this
    stack. Some authors such as [11], who conducted a comprehensive review of WSN
    technologies and their applications in PA, claim that the most suitable technology
    for this type of applications is narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT). A well-known
    example is long-range radio (LoRa), which allows very low energy consumption and
    long life (i.e., 10 years with battery), low cost, wide coverage and large networks
    (52,000 devices/channel/cell). This is why LoRa is being used extensively in IoT
    applications in all fields, including PA [19,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. However,
    there are numerous WSN deployments in PA that use 802.11 wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi)
    [18,33,34,35,36,37,38]. It is important to highlight that the suitability of each
    technology in terms of range, robustness and, above all, in terms of instrumentation
    capacity, must be analyzed and studied to use it properly. Wi-Fi networks have
    also been used previously in other disciplines such as post-harvest for monitoring
    perishable products in transport and conservation [39]. The sensor network described
    in this article aims to support agronomic trials to relate criteria of deficit
    irrigation in almond trees with measured values of soil-plant-atmosphere. To this
    end, it is necessary to study different deficit irrigation treatments. Due to
    the size of the plot, the number of trees and parameters to measure, a large and
    reliable network infrastructure was needed. WSN was selected as the best option
    for this study, since cabling would be very expensive and unfeasible in practice
    (due to the need of ducts and ditches, problems with animals, soil moisture...)
    and a Wi-Fi network was already available at the farm. In particular, using Wi-Fi
    allows us to take advantage of an infrastructure that already exists in several
    installations, it is easy to use and the development of the nodes can be very
    cheap due to its widespread integration in conventional microcontrollers. In technologies
    such as LoRa, the chips are licensed by a unique company (Semtech Corporation,
    Camarillo, CA, USA) and they are subjected to Intellectual property [29,40,41].
    In addition, Wi-Fi enables the integration of very heterogeneous equipment and
    sensors. On the other hand, there are a lot of very low-cost system on a chip
    (SoC) devices with Wi-Fi communication, which are very popular among IoT developers
    (like ESP8266 and ESP32 [38,42,43]). These devices allow easy integration of soil
    sensors with specific protocols in agriculture such as SDI-12. Although this technology
    has disadvantages including high power consumption (compared to others such as
    Zigbee or LoRa), the use of energy harvesting elements such as solar panels or
    micro wind turbines [44,45], allows the design of nodes with virtually unlimited
    autonomy. In fact, one of the objectives of this article is to demonstrate the
    feasibility of deploying WSN using Wi-Fi by properly managing the energy consumption
    of the nodes. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Plot The deployment was
    carried out at the ‘‘Tomás Ferro’’ Experimental Agri-food Station of the Technical
    University of Cartagena (37°41′18.9″ N; 0°57′01.7″ W; 32 m above the sea level),
    located at La Palma (Murcia, Spain) during three growing seasons (2017–2019).
    The plant material consisted of seventeen-year-old almond trees (Prunus dulcis
    (Mill.) D. A. Webb cv. Marta, grafted on Mayor rootstock) and spaced 6 × 7 m (238
    trees ha−1). The soil was a silty-clay-loam texture and the bulk density ranged
    1.3–1.5 g cm−3. The irrigation water, from the Tajo-Segura Water Transfer System,
    has low salinity (Electrical conductivity, EC25 °C, of 1.2 dS m−1) and was applied
    with an automatic controller (Agronic 4000, Sistemes Electrònics PROGRÉS, S.A.,
    Lérida, Spain) that performed control of irrigation, fertilization, pH regulation,
    pumping and filter cleaning with fault detection. The irrigation system was comprised
    of a double drip line per row with 12 pressure-compensated drippers (PC dripper
    4.0 L h−1, Netafim, Tel Aviv, Israel) per tree and spaced 1.0 m. Daily agrometeorological
    data were recorded by a weather station at the experimental orchard owned by the
    Agricultural Information Network System of Murcia (SIAM—siam.imida.es (accessed
    on 6 April 2020)). The climate of the area was classified as Mediterranean, with
    dry and warm summers and mild winters. During the experimental period, most rainfall
    events occurred between September and May, with the average annual rainfall of
    327 mm. The average annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) of 1320 mm with
    daily average temperatures ranged between 5.5 °C (January) and 29.5 °C (August)
    whereas air temperature rarely drops below 0.0 °C. Daily average relative humidity
    was ranged between 36.5% and 86.0%. 2.2. Irrigation Treatments The irrigation
    scheduling was carried out in taking into account the evaporative demand (reference
    crop evapotranspiration, ET0), the corresponding crop coefficients KC [46,47]
    and the percentage of ground area shaded by the tree canopy (Kr). Therefore, plants
    irrigation requirements (ETC) were determined as ETC = ET0·KC·Kr. In our case,
    the irrigation was managed remotely using a Wi-Fi infrastructure to facilitate
    and guarantee the reliability of the treatments. Irrigation treatments were distributed
    according to a randomized complete block design with three blocks per treatment.
    Each experimental plot consisted of three adjacent rows of four trees per row,
    but only the two central trees of the central row were used for experimental measurements.
    A total of five irrigation treatments were applied in this experiment and the
    annual average of water applied was 7658, 4758, 3490, 5220 and 4770 m3 ha−1 for
    the control treatment (this treatment is irrigated at 115% ETC in order to obtain
    non-limiting soil water conditions), sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) at 80%
    ETC (SDI80), and another at 50% ETC (SDI50), regulated deficit irrigation at 45%
    ETC (RDI45) and another at 30% ETc (RDI30) only in phenological stage IV and at
    100% ETc during the rest of irrigation season, respectively. Irrigation timing
    and frequency were varied during the irrigation seasons (February–November). 2.3.
    WSN Infrastructure The experimental plot already provided a basic Wi-Fi installation
    and data connection network, as it was included in the network infrastructure
    of the Technical University of Cartagena. Figure 1 depicts the general scheme
    of the devices, networks and services deployed in this work for the collection
    and monitoring of data, as well as for the remote management of the devices. On
    the laboratory terrace of the farm building (spot a), a device that integrates
    a 19 dBi 120-degree sector antenna and router board (mANTBox 19 s, MikroTik, Riga,
    Latvia) was installed. This router, powered by power over ethernet standard (PoE),
    was connected to the university network available at the laboratory. A virtual
    private network (VPN) server was configured in this router to facilitate network
    maintenance and access to equipment such as the datalogger and the fertigation
    controller. In addition, the router also implements the connection via 5 GHz Wi-Fi
    (802.11 ac) with a second router with integrated 16 dBi drum antenna (SXT Lite5
    ac, MikroTik, Riga, Latvia), located at spot b. The following devices are located
    at this spot (b): (i) A large weighing lysimeter (2.5 × 2.5 × 1.7 m) with forced
    suction at the bottom, installed in the middle of a 0.4 ha almond orchard with
    trees spaced at 5 × 6 m. The soil tank was laid on a platform equipped with load
    cells (model FX2, Sensocar, Spain) which supplied the total weight of the lysimeter.
    A 15-year old almond tree (P. dulcis (Mill) D. A. Webb cv. Marta) was used as
    a lysimeter tree for evapotranspiration determination (ETc). The accuracy of the
    whole weighing system was estimated to be ±500 g. The tree was drip irrigated
    by four laterals with six 4 L h−1 pressure compensating drippers. Irrigation management
    consisted of restoring water losses due to evapotranspiration and drainage from
    the previous day; (ii) A data-logger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA) used to collect data every 15 min from the sensors installed in the lysimeter:
    weight and drainage measurement, soil sensors for matric potential (MPS−6 Decagon
    Devices) and volumetric water content (VWC) (Enviroscan Sentek technologies, Stepney
    SA 5069 Australia), tree sensors for stress water index determination using dendrometers
    and thermo-radiometers. A climatic station with ET0 and vapor pressure deficit
    (VPD) was also installed; (iii) an Ethernet switch to connect the access points
    of the wireless links; (iv) a router (BaseBox 2, MikroTik, Riga, Latvia) and a
    dual polarity, 120°, 2.4 GHz 15 dB, sector antenna (AM2G15-120, Ubiquiti, New
    York, NY, USA) which provides 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi wireless coverage (802.11n) to the
    sensor nodes; (v) a 60 degrees 2 × 2 MIMO 10 dbi sector antenna with wireless
    on-board (SXT 2, MikroTik, Riga, Latvia) to establish an 802.11 wireless link
    to the irrigation controller, located at spot c. The fertigation control device
    (Agronic 4000) was connected to a serial Wi-Fi converter (USR-WIFI232-610, Jinan
    USR IOT Technology Limited, Shandong, China) through its RS-232 serial port to
    enable its wireless connection to the access point of spot b for the remote management
    of the fertigation programmer from any computer connected to the VPN of our installation.
    Figure 1. WSN infrastructure of the experimental orchard. Thanks to this infrastructure,
    the sensor nodes of the almond plot send the data to a server hosted in the cloud,
    which provides all the necessary services for its visualization from any personal
    computer or mobile device. This application allows real-time visualization, logging
    and querying of historical data, and alarm reporting among other features. 2.4.
    Agronomic Sensors To allow for real-time monitoring, several sensors were connected
    to wireless nodes (see Table 1): Table 1. Overview of the sensors used in the
    plot. A total of four sensors per replicate (twelve in total) deployed as follows:
    two volumetric soil water content sensors (10HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman,
    WA, USA) and two matric potential of soil water sensors (MPS-6, Decagon devices,
    Inc., Pullman, WA, USA), installed at 23 cm from each dripper and 25 and 45 cm
    depth located under the canopy and along the tree drip lines. A total of two linear
    variable displacement transducer sensors (LVDT, Model DF ± 2.5 mm, Solartron Metrology,
    Bognor Regis, UK) per replicate (six in total) were installed on the main tree
    branch for measuring micrometric branch diameter variations. A total of two infrared
    radiometer sensors (IR120, Campbell Scientific Inc., USA) per treatment were mounted
    on wooden poles and installed at 0.5–1.0 m over the trees canopy for monitoring
    canopy temperature. A total of four climatic sensors (VP4, Decagon devices, Inc.,
    Pullman, WA USA) were installed to record air temperature, relative humidity and
    vapor pressure deficit. 2.5. Sensor Nodes From the hardware/software point of
    view, there are two types of nodes: type A and type B, with different subtypes
    according to the sensors connected to them. The electronics of nodes A and B are
    housed inside a 120 × 120 × 90 mm IP65 box (G279C, Gainta AEK GmbH—Electrical
    Enclosures, Frankfurt, Germany). The power supply system consists of a 3.7 V,
    3000 mAh Li-ion rechargeable battery, charged by an 80 × 80 mm solar panel (5
    V, 0.8 W). Figure 2 shows pictures of both types of node installed in the field.
    Figure 2. Pictures of type-A (left) and type-B (right) nodes. Table 2 shows the
    25 nodes installed in the plot (see Figure 1), detailing, for each of them, the
    type it belongs to, the replicate, the irrigation treatment it is monitoring and
    the sensors connected to it. Table 2. Description of the deployed nodes. The hardware
    of the type A node (see Figure 3) is based on a wireless datalogger designed by
    our research group for PA applications (MEWiN MainBoard) [20]. For the signal
    conditioning from the sensors, an interface board (SensorBoard A) has been designed,
    connected to the first one by means of expansion connectors. An ESP8266 microcontroller
    (Esspressif Systems Co. LTD., Shanghai, China) with WiFi communication capability
    is also plugged to the SensorBoard A. Figure 3. Block diagram of type-A node.
    The SensorBoard A consists of four DC/DC voltage converters (12, 10, 5 and −5
    V), required to supply the sensors and to guarantee the operation of the different
    interfaces on the board: one for SDI12 sensors, another for radial dendrometers
    and one for analogue sensors (0–3 V). Finally, the board includes a circuit for
    the management of the rechargeable battery that supplies the power to the node.
    The type B Node is similar to type A, but it is based on the use of a Wipy 3.0
    (Pycom©, London, UK) (see Figure 4). Figure 4. Block diagram of type-B node. The
    SensorBoard B includes four DC/DC voltage converters (12, 10, −3.3 and −2.5 V),
    required to supply the sensors and to guarantee the operation of the different
    interfaces on the board: one for SDI12 sensors, another for thermal radiometers
    and one for analogue sensors (0–3 V). Finally, the board includes a circuit for
    the management of the rechargeable battery that supplies the power to the node.
    The software of the nodes was developed using the MicroPython programming language
    and a variety of open source libraries for Wi-Fi connectivity and sensor reading,
    among others. For some tasks, such as data acquisition from SDI-12 sensors, specific
    algorithms were developed. 2.6. Time Synchronization One of the requirements established
    by the agronomists for this study was that all the nodes should take the sensor
    measurements at the same time every 15 min so that they could be compared. Therefore,
    a synchronization algorithm was implemented: Once a day, the nodes connected to
    a time server (NTP) and update their real-time clock (RTC), which is very inaccurate
    (it has a daily drift of approximately 50 s). This inaccuracy, together with the
    drift of the internal timer in deep sleep mode (about 0.3%), generated a time
    drift that resulted in desynchronized measurements between nodes. To solve this
    problem, a time correction algorithm was developed. This algorithm determined
    the time the system requires to perform the measuring and data sending processes,
    working out the remaining time needed to be in deep sleep mode before waking up
    at the exact minute defined by the sampling period. In this deployment, measurements
    were performed every 15 min (minute 0, 15, 30 and 45 of each hour) and measurements
    were sent every 30 min (minute 0 and 30 of each hour). 3. Results and Discussion
    After the functional validation, in view of the importance of achieving the maximum
    autonomy, the current consumption of each of the node types was measured in the
    field. The measurements were performed with a data acquisition card (USB-6008,
    National Instruments Corp., Austin, TX, USA) that measured the voltage drop at
    a 1 Ohm shunt resistor placed in series with the battery that powered the node.
    The analog input of the card was configured in differential mode in the range
    of ±1 V and the acquisition was carried out in continuous mode at 1 kHz obtaining
    the averages every 0.25 s. In this mode, the card has a 12-bit resolution (equivalent
    to 0.48 mA) and an absolute precision at 25 °C of 1.53 mV (1.53 mA in current).
    For both type A and type B nodes, consumption tests were performed for the three
    possible operating modes, (i) the node connects to synchronize the date and time,
    collects data from the sensors and sends them to the server (this is the most
    energy-demanding operating mode and is therefore programmed to occur only every
    24 h), (ii) the node collects data and sends them to the server (occurs every
    30 min) and (iii) the node collects data and stores them in the memory card waiting
    for the next connection to the server (occurs in the middle of the period between
    sending events, i.e., 15 min later). 3.1. Consumption of Type A Nodes Node type
    A had a standby consumption of 1.1 mA. Figure 5 shows the current required in
    each of the states through which the node passes in operating mode (i). The measured
    current and the duration of each of these states are shown in Table 3. With these
    values, taking into account the standby current, the total consumption of the
    mode has been calculated with Equation (1). Figure 5. Node A—mode (i): NTP sync,
    sensor reading and data sending (once every 24 h). Table 3. Description of functional
    states of node A—mode (i). The function of each state is indicated in its description
    (Table 3). In state 2 (task signaling), the node displays information about the
    task it is executing by means of a lighting sequence of four LEDs. This information
    helps the user to perform maintenance and commissioning tasks in the field. 𝐼

    )·24 h =20.15 days (8) 3.3. Sensor Data Validation In order to demonstrate the
    usefulness and viability of the deployed network of nodes, data registered over
    a significant period of time from an agronomic and sensor network reliability
    point of view are shown below. Figure 11 shows the evolution of the VWC at both
    25 and 45 cm depth, measured by 10HS sensors (node 04). Irrigation was scheduled
    every two or three days at 11 a.m. and it took 2 h. VWC values ranged between
    0.413 and 0.336 m3 m−3 during the test period. The maximum values were reached
    during the irrigation events. After the irrigation events, VWC values fell due
    to infiltration and they stabilized at values close to 0.358 m3 m−3. The information
    registered by MPS-6 sensors (Figure 12) was complementary to that obtained by
    10HS sensors (Figure 11). In each irrigation event and depth, the value increased
    until it was close to −7 kPa, being considered this as field capacity [48]. The
    falls of MPS-6 sensors were steeper than those registered by 10HS sensors. Both
    types of sensors detected the irrigation events between 1 and 2 h after irrigation
    events started in both depths. During the test period, evaporative demand increased
    strongly, going from a reference crop evapotranspiration of 2.5 to 4.0 mm d−1
    at the end of the study period, which accelerated the falls of the VWC and soil
    matric potential values, as well as it showed a greater drop in values. The values
    showed both types of sensors at saturation level were similar to those reported
    by [49] on similar texture soil. Figure 11. Evolution of VWC sensors at 25 and
    45 cm depth measured by node 04 with 10HS sensors (year 2020). The arrows indicate
    the irrigation events. Figure 12. Evolution of matric potential at 25 and 45 cm
    depth measured by node 04 with MPS-6 sensors (year 2020). The arrows indicate
    the irrigation events. Additionally, the nodes automatically and continuously
    monitored plant water status with LVDT sensors. Figure 13 shows trunk diameter
    fluctuations (TDF) where the daily cycle of shrinkage for RDI30 for three consecutive
    days can be observed. The maximum trunk diameter (MXTD) was reached at the beginning
    of the day and the minimum trunk diameter (MNTD) was recorded during the afternoon.
    From data obtained from TDF, two indices were calculated to establish plant water
    status. The daily trunk shrinkage values, calculated as the difference between
    MXDT and MNTD on the same day, were 271, 411 and 292 μm for three consecutive
    days, respectively. The trunk growth rate values were calculated as the difference
    between MXTD of two consecutive days. In general, they were close to 0 μm throughout
    the period considered. The trend and values obtained were in agreement with those
    reported by [50,51]. Figure 13. Evolution of trunk diameter fluctuations (TDF)
    of the RDI30 treatment trees during deficit irrigation period (stage IV). The
    data was stored by node 23 equipped with linear variable displacement transducer
    sensors (year 2019). 3.4. Reliability of the Nodes In general terms, the performance
    of the nodes was satisfactory. Obviously, the installation required periodic maintenance
    tasks, such as cleaning the solar panels, and eventual interventions due to occasional
    failures in the hardware of the nodes. The evolution of the battery voltage of
    the nodes is a useful indicator of the “health” of the node. As an example, Figure
    14 shows the evolution of the battery voltage of one of the nodes (node 25) in
    typical conditions. As can be seen, the battery management algorithm starts the
    charge when the voltage falls below the lower threshold (3.95 V) and stops when
    the upper threshold is reached (4.1 V). In this way, it works within the optimum
    voltage range for the battery and reduces the charge cycles, extending its useful
    life. During the charge there are different voltage peaks corresponding to the
    daylight hours (the solar panel supplies charge) and the hours of darkness during
    the night (there is no photovoltaic generation and the battery discharges due
    to the node consumption). The “discrepancy” that appears between days 82 and 87
    (22 and 27 March 2020) corresponds to days when solar radiation was lower due
    to the existence of cloudiness (see Figure 15). Figure 14. Typical behavior of
    the battery voltage in a node without operational problems. Figure 15. Battery
    voltage (node 25) vs. daily average radiation (source: http://siam.imida.es/ Agro-Meteorological
    Weather Station CA12-La Palma, accessed on 6 April 2020). Cloudy days. 3.5. Typical
    Node Failures Among the common problems detected during the operation of the deployment,
    the most frequent were those that led to the exhaustion or destruction of the
    battery. The usual reasons were (i) overheating due to the high temperatures reached
    inside the box in summer, (ii) dirt or ageing of the solar panels and (iii) natural
    ageing of the batteries as they reached the end of their lifespan. Figure 16 presents
    the evolution of the battery voltage of node 23. As can be seen, between 7 and
    27 March there was a prolonged discharge due to the ageing of the panel, which
    stopped charging (this was later verified in a field intervention). Once the solar
    panel was replaced on the 27th, the node started charging again. It is worth noting
    that from this graph it is possible to extract very interesting information: due
    to the failure of the panel, the node showed an autonomy of approximately 20 days,
    which validates the theoretical calculations indicated in the section of consumption
    and autonomy estimation of the nodes. Figure 16. Evolution of the battery voltage
    of node 23. Figure 17 and Figure 18 depict failures in two other nodes due to
    dirt on the solar panels (mainly dust and bird droppings). In the case of node
    5 (Figure 17), it can be seen that since 15 March, there were successive loads
    that did not reach the upper threshold. From 21 March, the panel did not supply
    the required current to increase the battery charge, whose voltage started a downward
    trend until 25 March, the day on which the panel was cleaned, and the node recovered.
    In the case of node 4 (Figure 18), the node never managed to reach the upper threshold
    because the panel current was not sufficient, so on 24 March, the voltage fell
    below the minimum operating voltage and the node stopped transmitting. Figure

    Conclusions The results described in this work demonstrate the viability of using
    new or existing Wi-Fi infrastructures for the collection of agronomic data with
    low-cost nodes in deployments for taking measurements over long periods of time.
    Although some authors argue that Wi-Fi is not the most suitable technology for
    WSN in PA, the application of techniques to reduce consumption and the use of
    energy harvesting methods (solar panels) allows for virtually unlimited node operating
    autonomy. Consequently, this work demonstrates that, properly managing the energy
    demand, WSN deployment using Wi-Fi is feasible and even advantageous in installations
    where Wi-Fi coverage is already available or a major investment in the communications
    infrastructure is not desired. In addition, the use of Wi-Fi is particularly convenient
    when using multi-node deployments on the same plot (high density), e.g., in research
    trials where it is necessary to replicate measurements in several locations to
    minimize variability, and also to perform them with different parameters to evaluate
    the performance of irrigation strategies on a given crop. In addition, time synchronization
    techniques have been implemented to ensure time alignment of the data measured
    by the sensors. This facilitates its subsequent analysis for the realization of
    agronomic studies that relate the different irrigation treatments with the state
    of the plant and the crop yield. Likewise, the experimental installation described
    in this work has demonstrated the reliability of the nodes, sensors and communications
    infrastructure used. The experimental results have shown that, although wireless
    networks require less installation and maintenance tasks than wired ones, they
    do need programmed servicing interventions and occasional troubleshooting. Next
    steps would involve the integration of nodes with other communication technologies
    such as LoRa to carry out studies to compare the advantages and disadvantages
    of each technology. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.T.-S. and M.J.-B.;

  description: In today’s digital age, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining popularity.
    IoT has made everything smart, for example, smart cities (smart buildings and
    smart homes), smart healthcare (personal monitoring, smart wearables), industrial
    automation (especially manufacturing), commercial (shopping systems, retail),
    and even that agriculture too. IoT is becoming increasingly important in today’s
    digital age, resulting in a rapid rise in the number of devices connected to it.
    Massive amounts of data will be produced by such widely distributed IoT devices
    at the network’s edge. Processing these massive amounts of data in the centralized
    cloud is expected to result in increased 400bandwidth utilization, latency, and
    network congestion. Edge computing has become a popular paradigm in recent years
    for reducing network congestion and serving real-time IoT applications by providing
    services close to enduser devices. Agriculture is the foundation of the economy
    of any nation in the world. By 2050, the world population will need a 70% increase
    in food production to feed an estimated global population of more than 9 billion
    people. Potatoes are consumed all over the world and its production plays an important
    role in agriculture. The two primary diseases that adversely affect the yield
    of potato crop production are early blight and late blight. Therefore, in this
    work, we used containerized microservices to deploy machine learning models to
    resource restricted edge nodes on agricultural land for real-time disease and
    irrigation water requirement prediction in potato crops. Containers are lightweight
    and easy to deploy, making them the ideal choice for running machine learning
    models on resource-constrained edge nodes. We examined AlexNet, MobileNet, and
    VGG16, three deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), to detect these diseases
    automatically. A dataset of 7128 images containing healthy and diseased leaves
    of potato plants was used to train all three CNN models on the cloud. Even if
    training is outsourced, trained models need a lot of RAM; hence, the first aim
    of this study is to find a lightweight CNN model that can easily fit into resource-constrained
    devices. To improve potato crop yield and reduce economic losses, we found and
    deployed lightweight CNN model at the edge node to identify diseases in real time
    using leaf pictures recorded by in-place camera devices. The advantage of the
    developed technique is that by classifying potato leaf pictures in real time on-premises,
    there is no need to transfer images to the cloud for probable disease identification,
    which increases network congestion. The lightweight CNN model achieved 99.87%
    accuracy for both train and test images, according to the results. Precision (P),
    Recall (R), and F1 score (F1) are also displayed, to visualize the model’s efficiency.
    Similarly for real-time prediction of irrigation water requirement in potato crop,
    we trained two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic
    Regression (LR) on 100,000 values of records. Each record has four input parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and how many days the crop was planted
    before). With four input parameters in each record (soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and how many days before the crop was planted), the model decides whether
    the water pump should be turned on or off. The SVM model and the LR model attained
    92 and 73% accuracy, respectively, in determining whether the water pump should
    be turned ON or OFF.

    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    system (edge devices). 2.1. Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation
    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Left: An Illustration of how AICropCAM was set up in the field for
    image collection. In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar
    panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and
    its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep
    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation
    and image augmentation. Model Number of images Data Augmentation Techniques Total

    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of message generation and data size reduction
    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    Confusion matrix for test images by CropClassiNet. CanopySegNet on the test images
    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal
    curves of crop CC, as shown in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res image (621KB)

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    detection 5.25 V × (0.62 – 0.70) A Arduino MKR1310 Sleep mode <0.01A Serial communication
    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

  description: As the Hass avocado crop expands exponentially in Colombia, concern
    about its increasing water use is on the rise. This research aimed to develop
    IS-SAR, a free-access web application to schedule irrigation for Valle del Cauca’s
    Hass growers. We calibrated the water cloud (WCM) and artificial neural network
    (ANN) models using field data measurements from Hass avocado orchard plots in
    Valle del Cauca (Colombia) and Sentinel 1 (S1) satellite imagery measurements
    and evaluated their performance computing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and
    Pearson correlation coefficient (r). IS-SAR estimates the surface soil water content
    from the most recent S1 image, becomes it in water depth, and recommends to users
    apply irrigation according to allowable depletion limits, computed from a spatially
    distributed θ at field capacity and permanent wilting point obtained from a soil
    database of the study area. Our results indicate that the surface soil water content
    was retrieved with a better performance by the ANN (RMSE = 0.05 m3 m−3, r= 0.74),
    compared with the WCM (RMSE = 0.06 m3 m−3, r= 0.47). IS-SAR simulations in validation
    orchard plots result in irrigation events of up to 107 L tree−1 for 3.4 h. The
    IS-SAR web application provides near-real-time irrigation information to assist
    Hass avocado growers in designing better irrigation routines and improving the
    regional understanding of water crop consumption.

    Systems in Libya Using Soil Salinity Data Predicted by GIS, Remote Sensing and
    Artificial Neural Networks Chapter © 2022 Introduction In a world demanding immediate
    actions for solving the water crisis (Naddaf 2023), implementing irrigation scheduling
    (IS) technologies could significantly contribute to efficient water use in agriculture
    (Zinkernagel et al. 2020). When farmers schedule irrigation, they are unaware
    that the water volume used to produce a kilogram of food would meet household
    water consumption per capita for several months (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2020; Bo
    et al. 2021). This situation indicates a clear disparity between the level of
    water used by agriculture and that used by others (Flörke et al. 2018; Wang et
    al. 2023). The core of the most commonly used IS methods has remained invariable
    over time; using these methods requires acquiring specialized equipment, handling
    large volumes of climate data, measuring soil properties, or managing software
    (Gu et al. 2020). Innumerable farmers worldwide lack technical knowledge, economic,
    or access-to-data capabilities to perform any of these IS methods for their crops
    (Yohannes et al. 2019; Berthold et al. 2021). All these limitations are also evident
    for Hass avocado growers in Colombia. Beyond the economic benefits propelled by
    the rising global demand for Hass avocados, the volume of water required for their
    production in Colombia has grown exponentially. In 2018, Colombian Hass avocado
    production represented an estimated total water footprint of approximately 300
    Mm3 (Sommaruga and Eldridge 2020); and in 2016, exported virtual water trade was
    31 Mm3 (Caro et al. 2021). Although rainfall is the main source of water for the
    crop (Erazo-Mesa et al. 2021), supplementary water from irrigation is needed to
    reach optimal fruit development (Grajales 2017). Moreover, Diaz et al. (2021)
    identified a gap between incipient avocado growers'' water management knowledge
    and the newest irrigation technologies. (Díaz et al. 2021), and regional environmental
    agencies have reported an increase in requests for crop irrigation water concessions
    (CVC 2021). One way to track IS parameters, bypassing some limitations of traditional
    IS methods, is through remote-sensing (RS) technologies (Tolomio and Casa 2020).
    RS technologies, scaled down to easy-to-use, cheap or free-access, and wide-coverage
    tools, have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for irrigators (Erazo-Mesa
    et al. 2022a). Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images have shown promising results
    for estimating the surface soil water content (SSWC), the water content in the
    first 5–10 cm of the soil depth (Li et al. 2021), at local and regional scales
    (Peng et al. 2021). SAR images have been used to estimate the occurrence of irrigation
    events, detect and map irrigated areas, and quantify applied volumes of water
    at a regional scale by employing SAR satellite projects for soil moisture and
    ocean salinity (SMOS), soil moisture active passive (SMAP), and advanced microwave
    scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) (Jalilvand et al. 2019; Dari et al. 2021) and at
    a plot scale using the Sentinel-1 (S1) project (Bousbih et al. 2018; Le Page et
    al. 2020; Ouaadi et al. 2020). Bousbih et al. (2018) and Han et al. (2020) estimated
    the SSWC using the water cloud model (WCM) for nonorchard crops, obtaining root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) values lower than 6.4 and 3.16% (Vol), respectively. Among the current
    challenges of using SAR images to schedule irrigation are the satellite revisit
    time, which is on average 4 days in countries at the equator, and the lack of
    correspondence between the effective root depth of some crops (for Hass avocados
    is 60 cm) and the superficial estimation of SSWC (Peng et al. 2021). To counterbalance
    the first limitation, some RS-based IS applications forecast irrigation parameters
    (Montgomery et al. 2015; Brinkhoff et al. 2019). Regarding the second limitation,
    some studies have modeled the soil water content at the root zone from SSWC for
    wheat (Babaeian et al. 2021) and Hass avocados (Erazo-Mesa et al. 2022b). Hass
    avocado growers could take advantage of SAR images, because SSWC dynamics are
    directly related to the superficial distribution of tree roots (Lahav and Whiley
    2002), a thin layer of litter on the soil surface near the trunk in some cultures
    which retains moisture (Bernal-Estrada et al. 2020), coarse soils and irrigation
    systems (Salgado and Cautín 2008), and dense canopy during the productivity period
    (Bernal and Díaz 2020). This research aims to develop an irrigation scheduling
    web application for Hass avocado orchards located in Valle del Cauca (Colombia)
    based on S1 images. Theoretical background The development and successful implementation
    of IS-SAR required a robust theoretical foundation associated with the SSWC, WCM,
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and irrigation scheduling concepts. A comprehensive
    theoretical background is essential for multiple reasons. First, it underpins
    our understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms governing soil water
    dynamics, which is fundamental to precise irrigation management. Second, a solid
    theoretical foundation allows for the informed selection and integration of the
    Water Cloud and ANN models, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our approach.
    Third, it enables the development of effective irrigation scheduling strategies
    that optimize water resource utilization while minimizing environmental impacts.
    Soil surface water content (SSWC) Precise measurements of available water in the
    root zone are required for irrigation scheduling of crops. However, accounting
    for accurate estimations of soil water content in space and time at plot, farm,
    and regional scales is challenging. Microwave measurements from SAR satellites
    have demonstrated being sensitive to backscattering properties of the soil surface
    by which these can detect soil water content changes from topsoil (Karthikeyan
    et al. 2017). The radar sensor''s soil cover type and wavelength mainly determine
    the depth at which the soil water content can be estimated (Babaeian et al. 2019).
    According to Babaeian et al. (2019), the theoretical penetration of the C-band
    signal, used here through the Sentinel-1 project, reaches 1.5 cm for agricultural
    soils. However, some studies have compared soil water content measurements in
    a range of 0–12 cm of soil depth with a backscattering coefficient from Sentinel-1
    obtaining reasonable correlations (Bousbih et al. 2018; Han et al. 2020; Ouaadi
    et al. 2020). We define SSWC as the water content in the first 10 cm of the soil
    depth (Li et al. 2021). Erazo-Mesa et al. (2022b) studied the influence of soil
    water content ( ) at several depth ranges on the soil water balance at depths
    of 0–60 cm ( ) for three Hass avocado orchard plots in Valle del Cauca (Colombia)
    and determined that the 5–10 cm range depth correlated better with the soil water
    balance, which is named here as . Water cloud model (WCM) WCM describes how the
    microwave signal backscatters on vegetation–soil–water systems, representing the
    vegetation canopy as a cloud with identical droplets randomly distributed within
    the canopy. Initially introduced by Attema and Ulaby (1978) and with some variants
    from the original (Ouaadi et al. 2020), this semiempirical model splits the total
    backscattering coefficient from SAR images to a determined polarization ( ) (for
    this study VV and VH) and radar signal incidence angle into the microwave signal
    backscattered by vegetation , soil , and the soil-vegetation interphase (usually
    neglected) (Eq. 1) (1) Canopy structure, leaf size and distribution, and vegetation
    water content influence the strength, and their effects are indiscriminately introduced
    in the WCM by parameters and (Eq. 2 and 4) (Prévot et al. 1993). Parameter is
    usually computed from the leaf area index (LAI) using the function , where is
    a parameter to find in the model calibration, and is LAI (Han et al. 2020). Due
    to the heterogeneity of vegetation–soil–water systems, the impact of the surface
    soil backscattered signal is adjusted by a two-way vegetation attenuation effect
    and added to the WCM through the value. depends on surface roughness (inferred
    from parameters and in Eq. 3) and surface soil water content, called originally
    in the WCM but customized for this study as (Eq. 3). The contribution of in the
    signal backscattered by soil can be linearly (Han et al. 2020) or exponentially
    (Bousbih et al. 2018) expressed (Eq. 3) (2) and, (3) and, (4) Artificial neural
    network (ANN) An ANN is a bioinspired algorithm that operates by emulating how
    the neural system in the human brain builds reasoned decisions from previous knowledge
    and new information perceived by senses (Samek et al. 2019). From Widrow''s Adaline
    to deep or convolutional neural networks, ANN fundamentals are nearly the same:
    a structured net of processing units (neurons) is sorted in layers, where connections
    among neurons are strengthened through training (Montesinos et al. 2022). ANNs
    have been used as an alternative to retrieve SSWC from SAR images with better
    agreement than semiempirical backscattering models (Bousbih et al. 2018; Mirsoleimani
    et al. 2019). A perceptron multilayer consists of a supervised ANN with m layers,
    n neurons by layer, and an algorithm that back-propagates the error. Irrigation
    scheduling Irrigation scheduling consists of apply the right amount of water in
    the proper moment to avoid that crop plants suffer water stress. Using the premise
    of maintaining the soil water in a crop within the desired limits (Eisenhauer
    et al. 2021), in this case the allowable depletion limit and field capacity, when
    the IS-SAR user computed the irrigation requirement can act in three ways (Fig.
    1): (1) When is between field capacity and the irrigation triggering limit (i.e.,
    available water was not depleted), supplemental irrigation can be performed; (2)
    when is situated left , exceeding the irrigation triggering limit, imminent irrigation
    must be applied; and 3) when is right of , soil accounts with excess water and
    irrigation are not needed (Fig. 1). The amount of water (water depth in millimeters)
    to be applied in actions 1 and 2 will be quantified by , where and are expressed
    in fractional units and 600 corresponds to the crop root effective maximum depth
    (in millimeters) (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Irrigation actions according to the water content
    of a cultivated soil found by users in IS-SAR Full size image Materials and methods
    Influence area of IS-SAR and plots’ characteristics IS-SAR was implemented for
    Hass avocado growers located in the current and potential production area (PPA)
    in the department of Valle del Cauca (Colombia) (Fig. 2a). PPA has an extension
    in Valle del Cauca of 330,279 ha and is characterized by a mountain landscape
    in a range of altitudes from 1500 to 2500 m.a.s.l and slopes that exceed 25%.
    The mean temperature and annual rainfall range from 18 to 24 °C and 1000–2000
    mm in PPA, respectively, and soils were formed from volcanic ashes of igneous
    and metamorphic rocks at altitudes above 1800 m.a.s.l. and sedimentary, igneous,
    and metamorphic rocks below 1800 m.a.s.l. (CVC and IGAC 2017). Approximately 400
    growers distributed in 5216 ha in the north and center of Valle del Cauca manage
    Hass avocado orchards from 1 to 430 ha, predominating small farms (Díaz et al.
    2021; MADR 2021). Fig. 2 Location of Colombia in South America (a), location of
    Valle del Cauca in Colombia (b), and location of the influence area of IS-SAR
    in Valle del Cauca (a) Full size image Our study is focused on a detailed pixel-level
    analysis of the S1 imagery (spatial resolution 100 m2). It is expected that the
    retrieved spectral response of S1 images results of a mixture of the avocado canopy,
    sparse pastures, and bare soil in 100 m2, in which are 2 to 4 avocado trees (49
    m2 to 24.5 m2, respectively) given a tree density in the study plots. The low
    tree density is an advantage for modeling the surface soil water content for Hass
    avocado crops, compared with high-density crops where the contribution of soil
    to the backscattering coefficient close to harvest significantly decreases. Sentinel
    2 imagery was also evaluated to calculate NDVI time-series data to be used as
    a proxy to derive LAI as input parameter for (Eq. 2). In the influence area of
    IS-SAR (Fig. 2a), the commercial 2-ha plots in Laurentina, Poncena, and Olival
    orchards were selected, which were cropped with Hass avocado at densities of 408,
    238, and 204 trees ha−1, respectively (Fig. 2c, d, e). The canopy area and trunk
    diameter varied according to the age of trees. The average values measured for
    canopy area were 6.28 ± 3.30, 9.70 ± 3.35, and 1.43 ± 0.69 m2 for Laurentina (3.5
    years), Poncena (5 years), and Olival plots (2.5 years), respectively, and average
    trunk diameters measured for Laurentina, Poncena, and Olival plots were 0.47 ± 0.08,
    0.34 ± 0.11, and 0.52 ± 0.12 m, respectively. The soil properties measured in
    the laboratory for the three plots determined that these mostly have a sandy loam
    texture, with a sand content higher than 57% and a content clay content varying
    from 9 to 23%, and an average total available water of 0.08 cm3 cm−3. Three monitoring
    trees were selected for each plot, where soil matric potential at 15, 45, and
    75 cm of depth was measured from 15 August 2020 to 15 August 2021 (Fig. 2c, d,
    and e) using granular matrix sensors. Moreover, climate data were recorded in
    this period using portable weather stations installed in the center of each plot.
    Regarding irrigation, a drip system was implemented for the Laurentina plot; Olival
    plot accounted for micro-sprinklers; and Poncena’s grower irrigated the trees
    one at a time with a hose. Approximately one fertigation events a week were implemented
    in Laurentina, totaling 44 in the study period (1245 mm). Conversely, irrigation
    was scheduled based on a visual manifestation of water deficit in trees in the
    Olival and Poncena plots. In Olival, no irrigation was needed during the study
    period, because rainfall met the water requirements of the crop, while in Poncena,
    the crops were irrigated five times (153 mm). The amount, date, and time of each
    irrigation event for Laurentina and Poncena were recorded. Annual precipitation
    of 1372, 1782, and 1275 mm for Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plot were recorded,
    respectively. Methodological framework This study can be described in four major
    steps (Fig. 3). First, , , and were merged by date to calibrate the WCM and ANN
    models. Second, the best model that retrieved using S1 images was selected, and
    the best-adjusted linear regression parameters to predict soil water content at
    0–60 cm ( ) from were found. Third, at field capacity ( ) and permanent wilting
    point ( ) were spatially modeled, and finally, IS-SAR was designed, evaluated,
    and uploaded online to Hass growers (Fig. 3). Each of these steps comprises other
    steps, which are shown in Fig. 3’s flowchart and described in detail later. All
    these procedures described in the following sections and the graphical outputs
    (package ggplot2) were coded in R scripts. Fig. 3 The four steps outlined in the
    methodological framework used in this study Full size image Step 1: Calibrating
    the WCM and ANN models Soil volumetric water content time-series and irrigation
    practice description And time-series were obtained from the Erazo-Mesa’s et al.
    (2022b) study who modeled the vertical water dynamics in the soil profile up to
    90 cm at nine Hass avocado trees in the Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plots
    (Fig. 2). Soil matric potential, climate, soil properties, and crop parameter
    data were monitored, the first two hourly, at the trees from 15 August 2020 to
    15 August 2021 as inputs to calibrate the Richards equation, van Genuchten, and
    Mualem pore distribution models (Mualem 1976; van Genuchten 1980; Hillel 2014)
    through Hydrus-1D software (Simunek et al. 2012). Further details for the field
    equipment, Hydrus-1D modeling, and procedures to select the surface depth range
    for can be found in Erazo-Mesa et al. (2022b). Processing of Sentinel-1 images
    A collection of 152 Sentinel-1 C-band images at the Level-1 GRD was processed
    on Google Earth Engine (GEE) using the framework routine developed by Mullissa
    et al. (2021). With a spatial resolution of 10 m, VV and VH polarizations, and
    ascending–descending orbits, this collection was delimited by the geographic quadrant
    76.869–75.990 W and 3.295–4.478 N and filtered from 15 August 2020 to 15 August
    2021. The 152 S1 images were composed of 48 Sentinel 1A (S1A) and 106 Sentinel
    1B (S1B) images from orbits 142 and 48 and acquired at 15:51 UTC and 04:21 UTC,
    respectively. The revisiting time was 12 and 7 days between S1A and S1B images,
    respectively, and averaged 4 days among consecutive S1 images. The procedures
    executed by Mullissa’s et al. (2021) framework routine included additional border
    noise correction, a multitemporal speckle filter, and radiometric terrain normalization
    using the NASA SRTM 30-m DEM, according to the incidence angle. Then, the in VV
    and VH polarizations (in dB units), (in degrees units), and acquisition date (in
    decimal format) were extracted from the images'' pixels intersected with tree
    monitoring coordinates. S1 images and θ integration The time-series product of
    merging by date , , and was split into calibration (15 August 2020–15 February
    2021) and validation (16 February 2021–15 August 2021) datasets. The calibration
    dataset, with 384 records, was used to calibrate the WCM and train the ANN, and
    the validation dataset, with 306 records, was used to select the best model. Inversion,
    NSGA-II implementation, and parameter optimization of WMC WCM calibration consists
    of finding the values of parameters , , , , and that minimize the difference between
    and . Although the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) at the tree monitoring coordinates
    was computed from Sentinel-2 images to calculate the LAI, the scarce free-cloud
    images in the study area impeded consolidating an NDVI time-series similar to
    that obtained from S1 images. Thus, parameter was optimized as the other WCM parameters.
    In this study, the WCM was calibrated using the optimization genetic algorithm
    NSGA-II (Deb et al. 2002), according to Kumar et al.’s (2012) suggestions. First,
    was computed using and from the calibration dataset and synthetic parameters ,
    , , , and , provided by NSGA-II. The computed was compared iteratively (100 generations
    and a population size of 500) with through a three-objective optimization function
    (Eq. 5–7). In Eq. 5–7, is the RMSE function, is one minus the coefficient of determination
    ), is a function that computes the number of undefined/infinite outputted values
    (ideally zero), represents the paired values ( for a time , and is the number
    of calibration dataset pairs (5) (6) (7) Since no restriction in the sign and
    magnitude of , , , , and were reported in the forecited studies, they were set
    to vary between − 100 and + 100 in NSGA-II. The best combination of , , , , and
    was selected based on the crowding distance. NSGA-II implementation and validation
    were coded in an R script, wrapping the R function nsga2R (Tsou 2013) into a set
    of R functions to achieve the procedure previously described. ANN architecture
    and training To train the ANNs, 25 multilayer perceptron networks were configured,
    building two hidden layers and adding 1 to 5 neurons for each layer. These architectures
    were trained 200 times, for a total of 5000. The input variables for each architecture
    corresponded to , , and tree monitoring coordinates, and the output variable corresponded
    to . All these variables were scaled between 0 and 1. The calibration dataset
    was split into 60, 70, and 75% of the data for training and the remaining percentage
    was used to select the best architecture, which accounted for the lowest RMSE
    (Eq. 5) and the highest (right side of Eq. 6). ANN implementation was conducted
    using the function neuralnet from the neuralnet R package (Fritsch et al. 2019).
    Step 2: Selecting the best model Was computed using the validation dataset and
    the calibrated the WCM and trained ANN models and was added to the validation
    dataset. Then, RMSE (Eq. 5) and (right side of Eq. 6) were computed. Two selection
    criteria were considered to select the best model: the lowest RMSE and highest
    and the simplicity by either coding its mathematical formulation or importing
    its dependent libraries to the IS-SAR project. Step 3: Interpolating soil water
    content at field capacity and permanent wilting point And permanent wilting point
    at a depth of 30 cm, and geographic coordinates were extracted from a soil survey
    study that described 300 georeferenced soil profiles in the study area (Fig. 1)
    (CVC and IGAC 2017). A geostatistical analysis was implemented to obtain the and
    maps. This analysis consisted of exploring these data to identify outliers, selecting
    the theoretical semivariogram, interpolating using ordinary kriging, and validating
    the interpolation (Oliver and Webster 2015). In addition to RMSE and , mean error
    (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and the comparison between the average of the
    observed ( ) and predicted-by-interpolation values ( ) were used to validate the
    and interpolations. The resulting maps were computed with a pixel size of 500 × 500
    m. Step 4: Implementing IS-SAR Web application design IS-SAR is an interactive
    web map application based on Sentinel-1 images that contains navigating, locating,
    zooming in–out, and plotting controls. This application has a module displaying
    one of the three irrigation actions described in the section \"Irrigation scheduling\",
    according to the current soil water content in the target plotted by the user.
    IS-SAR was designed using Django (Python) and JavaScript web frameworks and GEE
    API repositories (back-end). HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to design the
    front end. IS-SAR is hosted on the GitHub contribute project https://github.com/Viinky-Kevs/IS-SAR-APP.
    Once users draw the target plot in IS-SAR, the application functions call the
    framework routine developed by Mullissa et al. (2021) to obtain and from the most
    recent S1 image and compute for the target plot area using the best model selected.
    Then, is retrieved from using the calibrated linear model. IS-SAR obtains the
    and values from the closest and map pixels to the user plot centroid and compares
    them with the average in the user-drawn plot to select the irrigation action and
    compute the amount of water required to apply the irrigation. Based on the 27
    available S1 images from 14 August to 9 December 2021, the consistency of IS-SAR
    for irrigation scheduling in the study area was evaluated simulating the IS-SAR
    user executions for Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plots. For each plot, simulations
    consisted of creating an account, loading to IS-SAR its boundary in shapefile
    format (done once), calculating the irrigation actions and the irrigation water
    depth (to actions 1 and 2), and recording these data into a database. Results
    WCM and ANN calibration and the best model selection The WCM and ANN were successfully
    calibrated using the entire monitoring tree dataset and split by tree to retrieve
    from , , and the tree coordinates (for ANN). In WCM calibration, the best solutions
    accounted for an NSGA-II convergence, , and infinitive crowding distance. After
    calibrating the WCM using the backscattering coefficient at VV and VH polarizations,
    was selected to retrieve , because the RMSE was lowest and was highest for the
    nine monitoring trees. The resulting values for the WCM parameters , , , , and
    varied from − 99.99 to 98.90. When comparing these among trees and plots, no recognizable
    pattern in the magnitude and sign of these parameters was found. Regarding ANN
    training, the error threshold and the maximum number of cycles were set to 0.02
    (in 0–1 scaled units) and 1000, respectively. Therefore, the ANN training finished
    in a reasonable time (1 h), with an acceptable prediction error, and converged
    a high percentage of the tested ANN. The ANN architecture with the lowest RMSE
    and highest in the training stage for was 5:5 (5 neurons for the two hidden layers).
    The evaluated Hass avocado plots'' soil water content at depths of 5–10 cm changed
    considerably over time (Fig. 4). varied from 0.11 m3 m−3, a value close to for
    monitoring tree O3 (Fig. 4f), to 0.49 m3 m−3, a value close to saturation for
    monitoring tree P2 (Fig. 4h). These changes were mainly produced by fallen rain
    and applied irrigation (Fig. 4c, f, and i), evapotranspiration, and sandy soils,
    which poorly retained moisture. averaged 56%, 97%, and 73% of the time above for
    Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena trees, respectively. These percentages suggest
    that fallen rain was frequent and abundant for the Olival plot and that irrigation
    was not needed, while irrigation was needed for the Laurentina and Poncena plots.
    Fig. 4 Surface soil water content retrieved from the Water Cloud Model (WCM),
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and their comparison with that simulated by
    Hydrus-1D for the calibration and validation periods at monitoring trees of Laurentina
    (a–c), Olival (d–f), and Poncena (g–i) Full size image varied in the monitoring
    trees at a rate from 0.02 to 0.04 m3 m−3 between consecutive estimations (Fig.
    4). Due to the low frequency of the data, the time-series presented a nonnatural
    behavior in its changes, hindering the identification of sudden increases and
    later decreases in moisture after inputs of water, as observed in the time-series
    (Fig. 4). The WCM and ANN models were consistent with the estimation in the calibration
    and validation periods, with an average absolute difference between models of
    0.02, 0.03, and 0.03 m3 m−3 for the Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena monitoring
    trees, respectively (Fig. 4), and a maximum difference of 0.05 m3 m−3 for the
    monitoring tree O3 (Fig. 4f). An increasing error in the time-series was observed
    in the monitoring trees P2 and P3 for the validation period (Fig. 4h, i, respectively),
    coinciding with a high , a consequence of the frequent rainfalls in this period.
    The error and agreement between and , calculated for the WCM and ANN models in
    the calibration and validation periods, are shown in Table 1. The WCM estimated
    with a maximum RMSE of 0.04 m3 m−3 and 0.05 m3 m−3 per-tree calibration and validation,
    respectively, representing 17% (tree O1) and 15% (tree P2) of the average . The
    value broadly varied for the WCM among trees with a maximum of 0.33 for calibration
    and reported a value of 0.01 for five trees for validation. The ANN model slightly
    improved the WCM performance, obtaining maximum RMSEs of 0.03 m3 m−3 and 0.07
    m3 m−3 for calibration and validation per tree, respectively, which represent
    18% (tree O3) and 30% (tree O1) of the average . The for ANN was consistently
    higher than that for WCM for per-tree calibration with a value higher than 0.40,
    but this decreased for validation, obtaining a maximum value of 0.44. Regarding
    the performance per plot, the RMSE average for the two models was lower in Laurentina
    for calibration and validation, compared with the RMSE average of the other plots
    (Table 1). Table 1 Root-mean-square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient
    ( ) for the calibration and validation of the water cloud model (WCM) and artificial
    neural network (ANN) for the nine monitoring trees in the study area Full size
    table Differences of 0.02 and 0.01 were calculated by comparing the RMSE of ANN
    and the WCM for calibration and validation, respectively, suggesting a better
    performance of ANN when all-trees data were used. Moreover, the value for the
    ANN exceeded 0.37 and 0.27, which were obtained by the WCM for validation and
    calibration, respectively. Although the trained ANN model performed consistently
    better than the WCM, the WCM was selected to retrieve from S1 images due to its
    simplicity in tracking the surface soil water content for the IS-SAR web application.
    The calibration and validation of the WCM and ANN models for all trees resulted
    in a higher RMSE and higher values than those obtained per tree. However, all-tree
    optimized WCM parameters integrally represent the dynamics in the study area.
    From surface soil water content to soil water content at depths of 0–60 cm The
    linear regression model implemented to obtain from resulted in Eq. 8, with an
    RMSE of 0.05 m3 m−3, value of 0.51, and (8) Soil water content at field capacity
    and permanent wilting point maps And maps were obtained with a spatial resolution
    of 500 × 500 m by applying the geostatistical steps described in Sect.  2.5 (Fig.
    5). In the exploratory analysis, 45 outliers were removed for both variables,
    and after testing several transformation functions without improving the interpolation
    performance, and data were processed without transformation. The semivariogram
    analysis resulted in selecting the Spherical and Mattern models for and , respectively,
    with the parameters shown in Table 2. The found nugget values indicate a high
    variability among samples separated at very short distances. The and semivariogram
    ranges of 22 and 6 km imply that spatially distributed points of are autocorrelated
    at a greater distance than . The difference between the averaged observed ( )
    and interpolated ( ) values for and was 0.01 and 0.01, respectively (Table 2).

    an average value of 0.28 m3 m−3, varied from 0.10 to 0.29 m3 m−3 with an average
    value of 0.17 m3 m−3, and the total available water (i.e., ) varied from 0.03
    to 0.24 m3 m−3 (Fig. 5). The lowest values were in the northwest and southwest
    of the study area, where Laurentina and Olival''s monitoring trees were located
    (Fig. 5a). The location of the highest and lowest values coincided with that of
    . The zone with a low total available water is delimited by the range 0.030–0.094
    and is distributed in 20.2% of the study area, where the monitoring trees are
    located (Fig. 5). IS-SAR web application IS-SAR is a web application for Hass
    avocado growers in the Valle del Cauca (Colombia) that need scheduled irrigation
    in their orchards. This application, accessible from http://www.is-sar.com, accounts
    for the calibrated WCM, two layers of and at a spatial resolution of 500 × 500
    m, and a linear regression model to transform into to retrieve the soil water
    content in the target plot at the crop effective root depth of 0–60 cm using the
    most recent S1 image. To access the main IS-SAR page (Fig. 6b), users must create
    an account and log in (Fig. 6a). Then, users must locate their plot and draw it
    using the drawing polygon tool. IS-SAR computes , determine the irrigation action
    according to the position in the total available water and recommend the user
    the action to take and the water depth to apply (Fig. 6c). Fig. 6 Login page (a)

    irrigation scheduling for plot \"L2\": soil water spatial variability (c) and

    size image To evaluate IS-SAR, 27 simulations were conducted in the Laurentina,
    Olival, and Poncena plots on dates coinciding with the S1 revisit time (Fig. 7).
    In the simulation period, in the Laurentina plot, 397 mm of irrigation was applied,
    plus 553 mm of rainfall kept the soil water close to field capacity and below
    the irrigation triggering limit. IS-SAR recommended applying supplementary irrigation
    (action 1) of 12 mm on average for the Laurentina plot, which is equivalent to
    applying, on average, one drip irrigation of 39 L tree−1 for 1.2 h (dripper flow
    of 4 L h−1) (Fig. 7a). Fig. 7 Irrigation water depth to be applied in IS-SAR simulation
    actions on dates coinciding with the S1 revisiting time for the Laurentina (a),
    Olival (b), and Poncena (c) plots Full size image Although no irrigation was applied
    in the Olival plot and the rainfall of 464 mm was smaller than that in Laurentina,
    this plot did not reach the irrigation triggering limit (Fig. 7b). In the case
    of applying irrigation when IS-SAR indicated the need for it, each Olival plot''s
    tree should have received 91 L for 2.8 h. A water shortage at the supply source
    meant that irrigation was not applied in the Poncena plot for the simulation period.
    Then, the rainfall of 504 mm was not enough to keep the soil water content at
    field capacity, increasing to 107 L tree−1 over 3.4 h for each simulated irrigation
    event (Fig. 7c). Discussion Sentinel-1 and its implications in irrigation scheduling
    Considering the irrigation frequency in the Laurentina plot in the maximum crop
    water demand (approximately one fertigation event per week) and other Hass avocado
    orchards with similar irrigation system, climate and soil conditions (Grajales
    2017), the S1 revisiting time of 7 days (Fig. 4) is suitable to track the soil
    water content and schedule and irrigate Hass avocado crops in Colombia, avoiding
    water stress. Similar IS-SAR satellite-based applications also account for week-based
    irrigation scheduling (Montgomery et al. 2015). Access to IS-SAR on the same days
    as the S1 revisit time, i.e., based on the S1 revisiting time calendar, could
    benefit avocado growers (Hill and Allen 1996; Fessehazion et al. 2014). Water
    cloud model and artificial neural networks LAI is an essential parameter for calibrating
    the WCM, because it relates to the backscattered signal from vegetation (Prévot
    et al. 1993). In the absence of LAI field data, the ten images resulting from
    filtering by cloudy percentage (< 60%) of the Sentinel 2 (S2) GEE collection for
    the study period were insufficient to build a robust NDVI time-series and compute
    the LAI of the monitoring trees. Therefore, our model is limited, because only
    S1 images were used to calibrate the water cloud and artificial neural network
    models. This variant for the WCM calibration differs from recent studies that
    used S1 and S2 images for calibrating the WCM (Bousbih et al. 2018; Ouaadi et
    al. 2020). In addition, the RMSE of 6% (vol) found for the WCM calibration and
    validation for sandy soils in this study, which have a reduced range of total
    available water, could increase the uncertainty of water depth computed in IS-SAR.
    Despite not having LAI data in the WCM calibration, the RMSE and values found
    after comparing the WCM and ANN model with the surface soil water content modeled
    by Hydrus-1D for sandy soils were similar to those reported by Bousbih et al.
    (2018) and Ouaadi et al. (2020). However, when a robust LAI model is integrated
    into the WCM, as Han et al. (2020) reported, the RMSE and values decrease and
    increase, respectively. Thus, LAI field data are required to improve the WCM calibration,
    reduce the error, and increase the agreement with the field SSWC data. In the
    same line with that found here, similar studies in sparce density tree crops have
    shown how the vegetation influences the soil moisture retrieved by SAR images.
    Chiraz et al. (2022) and Courault et al. (2022) found that the correlation of
    soil moisture with S1 measures under the canopy are lower compared with this when
    is measured on the row space among trees and Shashikant et al. (2021) found a
    strong correlation of vegetation descriptors with the WCM. In WCM calibration,
    the accuracy of SSWC retrieved from the backscattering coefficient with VH and
    VV polarizations depends on specific characteristics of the calibration sites,
    vegetation characteristics, and the inclusion of additional parameters such as
    soil texture and roughness. Although Bousbih et al. (2017) and Hajj et al. (2017)
    reported that was more sensitive to vegetation cover, Baghdadi et al. (2017),
    in the same line as that found here for sandy soils, found that was more precise
    than . Compared with the WCM, the ANN model retrieved SSWC with a lower RMSE and
    a higher value with the calibration and validation datasets. The addition of the
    monitoring tree coordinates (in decimal degree units) as input variables in the
    ANN training phase improved the performance of the model. Similar results were
    found by adding a priori rainfall and soil moisture condition information (El
    Hajj et al. 2017; Bousbih et al. 2018). IS-SAR web application IS-SAR is a novel
    web application to track the water content in soils cropped with Hass avocado
    and schedule irrigation at the plot level. No antecedents were found in irrigation
    scheduling web applications based on SAR images. Similar scheduling irrigation
    web applications use optical images (Montgomery et al. 2015; Calera et al. 2017)
    but cannot be used in Valle del Cauca due to its cloudy conditions throughout
    the year. IS-SAR, available for Hass avocado growers in the Valle del Cauca on
    http://www.is-sar.com, could be extended to be used in other Colombian regions
    using additional calibration points. Once implemented, the potential impacts of
    IS-SAR in Hass avocado orchards include improved irrigation scheduling, reduction
    in the applied irrigation water volumes, and a good match between water supply
    and crop water demand, all of which increase the use of digital agriculture practices
    (Erazo-Mesa et al. 2022a). In 10 of the 12 months in which the WCM was calibrated
    and in the 5 months in which IS-SAR was evaluated, the ENSO climate phenomenon
    La Niña increased rainfalls and decreased the crop irrigation water demand in
    the study area. In the context of scarce rainfall and an increase in Hass avocado
    irrigation demand caused by El Niño, the S1 revisiting time of 7 days would result
    in a long irrigation schedule. Although the WCM was calibrated using field data
    from nine monitoring trees, which provided a proper generalization of the soil
    water content dynamics in the study area, it is recommended to check with a soil
    moisture probe or similar device the correspondence between the in-field soil
    water content and the outputted values by IS-SAR. Notably, the more precise the
    and maps are, the more accurate the IS-SAR irrigation estimation. Moreover, IS-SAR
    depends on the correct and continuous operation of S1 satellites. The results
    of IS-SAR simulations shown in Fig. 7 coincided with the soil water dynamics,
    applied irrigation, and climate recorded and observed in the field from 15 August
    2021 to 9 December 2021 for the Laurentina, Olival, and Poncena plots. Notably,
    the high amount of rainfall caused by La Niña and irrigation (for Laurentina)
    implied that the water irrigation depth did not accumulate, decreasing to critical
    soil water content values. Although the available water content at the three plots
    was similar, averaging 0.10 m3 m−3, the high field capacity and permanent wilting
    points in the Poncena plot soil retrieved from the corresponding maps caused this
    plot to exceed the irrigation triggering limit in all IS-SAR queries. Conclusions
    We developed a near-real-time irrigation information tool—IS-SAR—to assist Hass
    avocado growers in designing better irrigation tasks and understanding water crop
    consumption. The IS-SAR implementation allows us to conclude that the Sentinel-1
    revisiting time of 7 days is appropriate to schedule Hass avocado irrigation in
    the current climate and soils of Valle del Cauca (Colombia). The ANN model performed
    better than the WCM in estimating SSWC due to its flexibility in adding a priori
    information. In permanently cloudy conditions, such as those presented in the
    Andean mountains of Valle del Cauca, LAI field data are required to improve the
    agreement with the field SSWC data. Under extreme wet conditions such as La Niña,
    further testing and evaluation of IS-SAR are needed. We are posing IS-SAR as a
    regional application to farmers who need to schedule irrigation for orchard and
    nonorchard crops. Data availability The data presented in this study are available
    upon request from the corresponding author. The data are not publicly available,
    because they are part of the research project, and the Research Group Regar is
    using the data for other analyses. References Attema EPW, Ulaby FT (1978) Vegetation

  description: Soil salinization is a widespread environmental hazard and a major
    abiotic constraint affecting global food production and threatening food security.
    Salt-affected cropland is widely distributed in China, and the problem of salinization
    in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    is particularly prominent. The salt-affected soil in Inner Mongolia is 1.75 million
    hectares, accounting for 14.8% of the total land. Therefore, mapping saline cropland
    in the irrigation district of Inner Mongolia could evaluate the impacts of cropland
    soil salinization on the environment and food security. This study hypothesized
    that a reasonably accurate regional map of salt-affected cropland would result
    from a ground sampling approach based on PlanetScope images and the methodology
    developed by Sentinel multi-sensor images employing the machine learning algorithm
    in the cloud computing platform. Thus, a model was developed to create the salt-affected
    cropland map of HID in 2021 based on the modified cropland base map, valid saline
    and non-saline samples through consistency testing, and various spectral parameters,
    such as reflectance bands, published salinity indices, vegetation indices, and
    texture information. Additionally, multi-sensor data of Sentinel from dry and
    wet seasons were used to determine the best solution for mapping saline cropland.
    The results imply that combining the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data could map
    the soil salinity in HID during the dry season with reasonable accuracy and close
    to real time. Then, the indicators derived from the confusion matrix were used
    to validate the established model. As a result, the combined dataset, which included
    reflectance bands, spectral indices, vertical transmit–vertical receive (VV) and
    vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) polarization, and texture information,
    outperformed the highest overall accuracy at 0.8938, while the F1 scores for saline
    cropland and non-saline cropland are 0.8687 and 0.9109, respectively. According
    to the analyses conducted for this study, salt-affected cropland can be detected
    more accurately during the dry season by using just Sentinel images from March
    to April. The findings of this study provide a clear explanation of the efficiency
    and standardization of salt-affected cropland mapping in arid and semi-arid regions,
    with significant potential for applicability outside the current study area.

    Versions Notes Abstract Soil salinization is a widespread environmental hazard
    and a major abiotic constraint affecting global food production and threatening
    food security. Salt-affected cropland is widely distributed in China, and the
    problem of salinization in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the Inner Mongolia
    Autonomous Region is particularly prominent. The salt-affected soil in Inner Mongolia
    is 1.75 million hectares, accounting for 14.8% of the total land. Therefore, mapping
    saline cropland in the irrigation district of Inner Mongolia could evaluate the
    impacts of cropland soil salinization on the environment and food security. This
    study hypothesized that a reasonably accurate regional map of salt-affected cropland
    would result from a ground sampling approach based on PlanetScope images and the
    methodology developed by Sentinel multi-sensor images employing the machine learning
    algorithm in the cloud computing platform. Thus, a model was developed to create
    the salt-affected cropland map of HID in 2021 based on the modified cropland base
    map, valid saline and non-saline samples through consistency testing, and various
    spectral parameters, such as reflectance bands, published salinity indices, vegetation
    indices, and texture information. Additionally, multi-sensor data of Sentinel
    from dry and wet seasons were used to determine the best solution for mapping
    saline cropland. The results imply that combining the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    data could map the soil salinity in HID during the dry season with reasonable
    accuracy and close to real time. Then, the indicators derived from the confusion
    matrix were used to validate the established model. As a result, the combined
    dataset, which included reflectance bands, spectral indices, vertical transmit–vertical
    receive (VV) and vertical transmit–horizontal receive (VH) polarization, and texture
    information, outperformed the highest overall accuracy at 0.8938, while the F1
    scores for saline cropland and non-saline cropland are 0.8687 and 0.9109, respectively.
    According to the analyses conducted for this study, salt-affected cropland can
    be detected more accurately during the dry season by using just Sentinel images
    from March to April. The findings of this study provide a clear explanation of
    the efficiency and standardization of salt-affected cropland mapping in arid and
    semi-arid regions, with significant potential for applicability outside the current
    study area. Keywords: irrigation district; cropland; quantile and quantile plots
    testing; dry season; Google Earth Engine 1. Introduction Soil salinization is
    a matter of concern in agriculture, as the excess salt hinders crop growth by
    obstructing the ability to uptake water. In another sense, it causes a loss in
    soil fertility and leads to the desertification of cropland [1,2]. According to
    the estimation released by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there
    are more than 424 million hectares of topsoil (0–30 cm) and 833 million hectares
    of subsoil (30–100 cm) are salt-affected around the globe (8.7% of the planet)
    [3]. Most of them can be found in naturally arid or semi-arid environments in
    Africa, Asia and Latin America [4]. Soils are easily affected by salt in arid
    and semi-arid regions where low rainfall and high evapotranspiration lead to the
    concentration of salts such as sodium, magnesium and calcium to form saline soils
    [5,6,7,8]. FAO launched the Global Map of Salt-Affected Soils in 2021, although
    the salt-affected soil of China has not been included in that. Nonetheless, estimates
    show that 20 to 50% of irrigated soils across all continents are too salty, implying
    that over 1.5 billion people face significant challenges in meeting rising food
    demand due to severe cropland salinity and cropland degradation [9]. Saline cropland
    is an essential part of reserve cropland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    in China and is an integral part of the cropland restoration program [10]. The
    salt-affect soil in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is mainly disturbed in
    the Xiliao River Plain in the east and Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in the
    west. The cropland of HID is dominated by saline soil and accounts for 30.5% of
    the saline cropland in Inner Mongolia [10]. In the early stage of the reclamation
    HID, flood irrigation without drainage facilities caused the secondary salinization
    of the field soil. For now, cropland salinization has gradually evolved into the
    main factor restricting the sustainable development of agriculture in HID. Therefore,
    the severe salinity cropland is a typical area for the agricultural management
    department’s soil rehabilitation program, which has attracted the interest of
    many academics [11,12]. The cropland soil salinity in HID is mainly adapted from
    the irrigation water of the Yellow River. Only 20% of the initial salt can be
    discharged through drainage, while 80% of the salt is kept in the soil of the
    irrigation area, showing a salinization trend [13]. Soil salinity will adversely
    affect plant growth, crop yields, and underground water quality, leading to soil
    erosion and land degradation [14]. The hazard of soil salinity is not limited
    to the environment but also includes the economy. For example, for the secondary
    salinization of the land in the Sultanate of Oman, the direct economic loss from
    mild to moderate salinity is about 1604 US dollars per hectare, and the direct
    economic loss from mild to severe salinity is as high as 4352 US dollars per hectare
    [15]. Thus, knowing the spatial distribution of salt-affected cropland is an urgent
    need to alleviate the contradiction between humans and land [16,17], which is
    also vital for promoting the high-quality development of the national agricultural
    economy [18]. At the same time, the eradicate because of dynamic and accessible
    restress from salinization after agricultural activities seriously endangers the
    sustainable development of agriculture and its productivity, which makes the timely
    detection of salt-affected cropland within HID with limited cropland resources
    particularly urgent [19,20,21]. Traditionally, soil salinity was measured by collecting
    soil samples and analyzing them in a laboratory to determine their solute concentration
    or electronic conductivity [22]. However, due to intensive sampling being time-consuming
    and expensive, the spatial variability of soil salinity is hardly fully characterized
    traditionally in a large area. Remote sensing data and techniques can more effectively
    provide economic and rapid tools and methods for mapping soil salinity [23]. Remote
    sensing data and its analyzing processes have gradually become the most convenient
    method of mapping soil salinity since black-and-white and color aerial photographs
    were used to describe salinity-stressed soils in the 1960s. Multispectral imagery
    such as Landsat [24], Sentinel [25], IKONOS [26], QuickBird [27] and UAV-Borne
    [28] are highly suitable for evaluating soil salinity. In the last three decades
    of research on monitoring saline soils, multispectral sensors have been mainly
    used. In addition, some researchers have emphasized the importance of ground sample
    data [29,30]. In practical applications, multispectral sensors also show limitations,
    as their spectral resolution and fewer bands affect the quality and quantity of
    information provided. Many current studies pointed out this limitation, thus monitoring
    the salinity using hyperspectral [31] and thermal infrared data [32], even Synthetic
    Aperture Radar (SAR) data [33] in the last few years. Nevertheless, the broad
    acquisition capability of Sentinel data, high spatial resolution (10 m), and the
    combination of active and passive remote sensing data can compensate for the deficiencies
    of multispectral data widely available for free. Remote sensing data with meter-level
    high resolution or sub-meter-level resolution (IKONOS, QuickBird, WroldView-2,
    GF series) have also been gradually introduced into salinity mapping research
    and have become indispensable data sources. Mapping the salinity of cropland combining
    high spatial resolution images and ground sampling data using machine learning
    algorithms is mainly carried out at the field scale or farm scale [34]. However,
    the validity and reliability of such a method need to be assessed in a larger
    area. Recent years have seen an increase in nonparametric machine learning techniques,
    particularly Random Forest (RF), to calculate soil salinity [35,36]. Since it
    can manage the high dimensionality and multicollinearity of remote sensing data
    with excellent classification accuracy and insensitivity to overfitting, RF is
    one of the most extensively used algorithms in land cover classification. Additionally,
    it has been stated that RF in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides
    unassailable benefits in the remote sensing classification of land cover in a
    large area [37,38]. Some researchers have demonstrated that RF outperforms other
    popular nonparametric machine learning algorithms, which can significantly increase
    soil salinity mapping accuracy [25,39]. However, many scholars have shown that
    using remote sensing technology to map cropland salinity in arid and semi-arid
    regions is challenging [23,24,40]. It is mainly because the bare ground and other
    sparse vegetation are easily confused with saline soil in spectral reflectance
    [33,41]. Alternatively, the method based on spectral reflectance may lead to unreliable
    results when the soil is moisturizing or the soil salts are not exposed on the
    soil surface in crystalline form but mixed with other soil components [42]. In
    this case, SAR data, frequently employed in detecting soil salinity, can capture
    information that is challenging to acquire using multispectral imagery. Various
    remote sensing data have already been used to study saline soil in HID. Nonetheless,
    the majority of these studies have focused on single sensors rather than multi-sensor
    images. Therefore, to comprehend the main mechanism causing agricultural salinization
    and degradation, a salt-affected map using a wide range of remote sensing data
    must be acquired in almost real time. To fill this gap, the following questions
    will be addressed in this study: Is the PlanetScope image of April appropriate
    for sample collection employing the Visual Interpretation strategy? If so, how
    can the samples’ validity—which includes cropland that is both saline and non-saline—be
    estimated? How to quickly and efficiently map salinized cropland using Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 data freely available in GEE? These questions are unavoidable in
    multi-sensor data-based mapping of salinized cropland, and addressing them is
    the primary goal of the current study. The specific objectives of this research
    are to: Create a cropland base map using global land cover data from ESA WorldCover
    while masking off roads and irrigation ditches collected from the electronic map
    of HID; Evaluate the validity of samples, comprising both saline and non-saline
    cropland, using the quantile and quantile plots testing method; Create a multi-variable
    dataset for salt-affected cropland identification using VV + VH dual polarization,
    reflectance bands, and vegetation indices; Determine the best solution for mapping
    salt-affected cropland in dry and wet seasons using the overall accuracies and
    indicators from the confusion matrix of various datasets. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. The Study Area HID is located at the top of the northernmost Bay of the Yellow
    River and spans a region situated at 106°11′35″E–109°53′52″E and 40°10′30″–41°16′43″N.
    HID comprises five counties in Bayannur city with a total area of 17,243.23 km2
    (Figure 1), with 733,333.33 hectares of cropland. The crop yield has been stable
    at more than 5 billion tons for a long time. It is Asia’s largest artesian irrigation
    area and one of China’s three largest irrigation areas. In addition, HID was included
    in the World Irrigation Engineering Heritage List in 2019. Spring wheat, corn,
    vegetables, citrus, and sunflowers are the main crops in HID (see phenology of
    main crops in HID in Table S1). Vegetables are grown in a few places after the
    spring wheat harvest, while other crops are sown as one-season crops. Figure 1.

    and PlanetScope images acquired from 1 to 13 April in 2021 (shown in false color
    composited-R: NIR (Near-Infrared) band, G: Green band, B: Blue band). (b) The
    location of HID in China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. (c) Field photographs
    taken on April 2021, showing the salt on the soil surface before crops were planted.
    A typical temperate continental climate prevails in the study area. The number
    of hours of sunshine per year is 3210.8–3305.8; the total amount of solar radiation
    is 146–152 kcal per square centimeter; the average yearly temperature is 6.1–7.6
    °C; the daily average temperature difference is 13–14 °C. Additionally, the average
    annual evaporation is 2200 mm, which is nearly twelve times the average annual
    precipitation of 180 mm. 2.2. Data 2.2.1. Filed Sampling The sample data for mapping
    saline cropland are based initially on the ground survey samples in previous studies.
    In contrast, the PlanetScope images acquired from April 2021 were utilized for
    delineating the reference samples using a visual interpretation strategy in this
    study, which was mainly because of the controlling measurements for preventing
    the COVID-19 epidemic during the critical period for collecting the ground truth
    samples. To accurately distinguish salt-affected soil from non-salt-affected soil
    on the cropland base map of HID, 1000 saline samples and 1000 non-saline samples
    were selected, as shown in Figure 2. High-resolution PlanetScope images were used
    as a reference to assess whether the soil was saline or non-saline, and each sample
    was labeled as either salinized or non-salinized, following the principle introduced
    in Figure 1. The study area is a typical arid irrigation farming area in northern
    China, with no winter crops grown throughout the year. This means the cropland
    surface in the irrigation area is bare outside from the previous year’s harvest
    to the sowing of the following year. Therefore, the soil salinity is in layers
    0–10 cm from March to April, which means the salinity of soil is on the surface
    and can be distinguished by the naked eye. This phenomenon leads to the surface
    reflectance of the saline soil captured by the imagery is also significantly different
    from that of the healthy soil. Figure 2. (a) The distribution of the samples of
    saline and non-saline cropland, (b) the samples in the false color composited
    PlanetScope image (R: NIR band, G: Green band, B: Blue band). Moreover, to ensure
    the accuracy of the artificially delineated saline and non-saline cropland samples,
    the number and spatial distribution must be as consistent as possible. Therefore,
    after the initial sample data are selected, the validity of the samples needs
    to be checked to ensure that the samples can adequately represent the category
    to which they belong. In this part, the quantile and quantile plots testing method
    will be applied to validate whether the selected saline and non-saline samples
    obey the normal distribution (Section 2.4). 2.2.2. Remote Sensing Data Collection
    PlanetScope PlanetScope, operated by Planet, is a constellation of approximately
    130 satellites that is able to image the entire land surface of the earth every
    day (a daily collection capacity of 200 million km²/day). PlanetScope images have
    a resolution of about 3 m per pixel. The four-band frame imager with a butcher-block
    filter provides Blue, Green, Red and NIR bands. The PlanetScope Ortho Scene Level
    3B Product has been used for selecting samples visually since it is an orthorectified,
    scaled Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Radiance Surface Reflectance image product suitable
    for analytic and visual applications. Sentinel The European Space Agency (ESA)
    was renamed the EU Global Security Monitoring GMES as the Copernicus program,
    considering service duplication and discontinuity in 2012. Sentinel satellites
    are part of the Copernicus program. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are two Earth observation
    satellites currently in service with high-resolution sensors that can be shared
    globally. The Sentinel-1 mission consists of a constellation of two polar-orbiting
    satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, operating day and night to perform C-band
    synthetic aperture radar imaging. SAR data with a 10 m resolution are available
    for 12 days revisit period. Commonly used Class 1 products include Single-Look
    Complex (SLC) and Ground Range Detection (GRD) products. SLC products preserve
    phase information and process at natural pixel spacing; GRD products incorporate
    detected amplitudes and multi-look to reduce speckle effects. Currently, only
    GRD products with Sentinel-1 data are integrated with GEE. The Sentinel-1 SAR
    imagery, in the Interferometric Wide (IW) mode, C-band, with dual polarization
    VV and VH, was acquired from 1 March 2020, to 31 April 2020, in coincidence with
    the field samples’ selection period. The Sentinel-2 mission consists of two solar
    polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-2A (23 June 2015–present) and Sentinel-2B
    (7 March 2017–present), distributed in a sun-synchronous orbit, each other into
    a 180° phase. Currently, Sentinel-2 mainly provides two product data: L1C and
    L2A. The L1C product is the reflectance data of TOA after orthorectification and
    sub-pixel geometric precision correction; the L2A product is the surface reflectance
    data product obtained using the Sen2cor tool officially provided by ESA to perform
    atmospheric correction on L1C. Data are available across Europe from October and
    globally from January 2017. Each Sentinel-2 satellite carries a multi-spectrometer
    MSI with 13 bands in the Visible, NIR, Narrow NIR and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR)
    spectral ranges, including three Red Edge bands. Sentinel-2 Leve-1C and Leve-1A
    data products have been integrated into GEE (find details in Table A1). Considering
    that the Leve-1C product has more extended data availability, the Leve-1C TOA
    data product of Sentinel-2 has been selected for mapping saline cropland. 2.2.3.
    Ancillary Data An initial cropland base map was created using the ESA WorldCover
    global land cover data package, which was developed based on the Sentinel-1 and
    Sentinel-2 at 10 m resolution, and it may be accessed at https://viewer.esa-worldcover.org/worldcover,
    accessed on 16 October 2022. The cropland category is 40 in the ESA WorldCover
    global land cover data. 2.3. Generating the Cropland Base Map In this section,
    the roads and irrigation ditches with a resolution of 2.4 m provided by AutoNavi
    Electronic Maps will be used to mask out the non-cropland areas within the fields
    of HID. Firstly, the GDAL module of Python extracted the roads and irrigation
    ditches from the electronic maps and then converted them to the SHP file. Secondly,
    the RASTERIO in Python was captured to mask the non-cropland parts from the WorldCover
    global cropland cover data. 2.4. Quantile and Quantile Plots Testing Generally,
    the same type of ground objects should have the same or similar spectral reflectance
    characteristics in the same wavelength range of remote sensing images. The saline
    soils in arid regions mainly contain salts such as chlorides, sulfates and carbonates.
    Before the first irrigation of spring sowing in the Yellow River irrigation district,
    the salinity in the topsoil of 0–10 cm would be at the highest level, and saline
    elements would cover the soil surface, whitening the soil surface, as shown in
    Figure 1c. Spring wheat is the earliest sowing crop in the study area that cannot
    be grown in saline soil. Other crops, such as vegetables, corn and fruit, can
    be grown in soils with slight to moderate salinity. Sunflower is the main salt-tolerant
    crop and can even be planted in severe saline soil. Therefore, the 3 m resolution
    PlanetScope images obtained in early April (spring wheat grows in the Emergence
    Stage and can cover the ground surface) were chosen to collect sample data additionally
    to solve the problem that ground truth sample data are difficult to distribute
    evenly in a large area (Figure 2b). It can be assumed that the eigenvalues of
    the saline and non-saline samples in different wavelength ranges obey the normal
    distribution. Conversely, when a specific sample contains anomalies, its distribution
    will deviate from the normal distribution. Therefore, the quantile graphical method
    (Quantile and Quantile Plot, Q-Q plot) can be used for sample validity tests for
    elements inconsistent during sample selection caused by visual interpretation
    errors. The Q-Q plot is a graphical technique for determining if two datasets
    come from populations with a common distribution. A Q-Q plot is the quantiles
    of the first dataset against the quantiles of the second dataset. Thus, the point
    (x, y) on the graph represents the quantile of the second dataset (y-coordinate)
    and the same quantile of the corresponding first dataset (x-coordinate). Therefore,
    the Q-Q plot will approximately lie on the line y = x superior if the two distributions
    are the same or similar. In this study, the x-axis was set as the normal data
    quantiles of the sample’s reflectance value. In contrast, the y-axis was set as
    the normal theoretical quantiles to test whether the two categories of samples
    obey the normal distribution. The reflectance of the ten bands (B2, B3, B4, B5,
    B6, B7, B8, B8A, B11, B12) of the Sentinel-2 images observed from March to April
    2021 (reduced to mean value on Google Earth Engine) are set as examples to illustrate
    the Q-Q plot (find the testing results in Section 3.2). 2.5. Modeling Strategy
    The technical frame of this study is illustrated in Figure 3. First, the reflectance
    bands of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were selected via spatial resolution
    to ensure the generalization and robustness of the models. In this step, bands
    at 60 m resolution were dedicated primarily to detecting atmospheric features
    and therefore are not included in subsequent research. Thus, indices and texture
    variables based on spectral reflectance were created at 10 m resolution. On the
    other hand, the backscattering signal of the Sentinel-1 VV + VH dual-polarization
    also participated in the modelling process at 10 m resolution. Figure 3. Technical
    framework of this study. 2.5.1. Spectral Salinity Indices The wide range of wavelengths
    of the Sentinel-2 data has an excellent capability for remote sensing monitoring
    and mapping requirements of soil salinity [25]. Therefore, the mean values of
    Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance were included in the combined dataset to map the
    saline cropland in HID accurately. Table A1 (Section 2.2.2) lists the bands used
    in this study. Applying spectral indices to investigate cropland salinity is built
    upon the different spectral behavior associated with image pixels of the ground
    object [43]. The salinization can dramatically change soil surface characteristics,
    leading to a significant difference from healthy soil, especially during the best
    monitoring period before the growing season in the arid and semi-arid regions
    with low vegetation cover and more exposed soil. Moreover, the presence of salinity-tolerant
    crop coverage on the soil may also be a marker to reflect the soil salinization,
    thus allowing indirect mapping of salinity-stressed cropland [44]. On the other
    hand, unhealthy vegetation photosynthetic activity resulted in increased visible
    reflectance and decreased near-infrared reflectance (NIR) [25]. Therefore, several
    vegetation indices (VIs), such as Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted
    Vegetation Index (SAVI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and
    Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), were used to map soil salinity.
    Numerous academics have regarded the VIs performance as appropriate for estimating
    soil salinity using remote sensing images [45]. To create a multi-variable model
    to map the saline cropland in an arid and semi-arid area, a succession of VIs
    commonly used for monitoring soil salinity was proposed in this study. Corresponding
    to this, other researchers have created various salinity indices, including the
    Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI) and Salinity Index (SI), to identify
    and map soil salinity. Table A2 provides specific information. On the other hand,
    for combinations of two or three wavelengths in remote sensing images, extensive
    information can be obtained from the indices determined by spectral reflectance
    at the 10 m resolution. 2.5.2. Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix Texture variables
    can provide valuable spatial information, reflecting the spatial distribution
    of the gray levels of remote sensing images and representing the spatial relationship
    between image features and the surrounding environment [46]. For instance, soil
    salinization in HID refers to the phenomenon in which the salt in the bottom soil
    or groundwater rises to the surface with capillary water. After the water evaporates,
    the salt accumulates in the surface layer. Thus, this phenomenon could significantly
    change the texture features of the land surface. The textures are essential for
    identifying objects or regions of interest, whether in photographs, aerial photos,
    or satellite images. GEE provides the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) function
    to calculate broad applicability textures and can be utilized in various image
    classification applications [47,48,49]. In this study, the 14 GLCM indicators
    proposed by Robert et al. [50] and four other indicators proposed by Conners et
    al. [51] were used to construct texture variables. The reflectance-based texture
    variables based on the B2 with the highest accuracy of the Sentinel-2 images were
    obtained in GEE for modeling the mapping strategy for saline cropland in HID.
    2.5.3. Classifier and Accuracy Assessment Random Forest is one of the machine
    learning algorithms widely used in land cover classification [52] and has been
    applied to the remote sensing monitoring research of saline cropland gradually
    [53]. Furthermore, the importance evaluation function of the variables of Random
    Forest can screen out the variable that contributes the most to classification.
    Therefore, it can support further research on soil salinity monitoring. Random
    Forest can build a multi-layer decision tree and randomly select subsets and variables
    of training samples. The classification accuracy of the Random Forest classifier
    on the GEE platform uses the incremental step of 100 trees to reach the highest
    accuracy with 600 trees. In addition, 70% of random samples are used to train
    the classifier, and 30% of random samples are used to validate the accuracy of
    the saline cropland classification. Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA),
    and User Accuracy (UA) were used to evaluate the performance of Random Forest
    classifiers on the GEE. OA is the ratio of the total number of correctly classified
    pixels to the total number of pixels (the total number of pixels in the ground
    reference samples). UA corresponds to the probability that a randomly selected
    pixel from the map is classified as correct in the ground reference samples. PA
    corresponds to the likelihood that the reference sample is correctly classified
    on the map. The Kappa coefficient was previously considered an indicator that
    can be used for consistency checks and to measure classification effects. However,
    Foody [54] points out that the Kappa coefficient is not a measure of accuracy
    but an agreement beyond chance. Hence, it is unnecessary and should not be used
    in typical remote sensing applications. Therefore, Foody [54] argues that researchers
    should abandon the Kappa coefficient as a measure of accuracy instead of per-class
    accuracy estimation and confusion matrices to evaluate machine learning classification
    accuracy. Based on this, the Kappa coefficient is not used as a criterion for
    assessing the accuracies in this study. In addition, to test the robustness of
    the RF on GEE, the F1 scores (F1 = 2 × UA × PA/ (UA + PA)) of saline cropland
    and non-saline cropland were also calculated. The F1-score is the harmonic mean
    of producer and user accuracies. In studies where the classification samples are
    not perfectly balanced, the F1 score is a strong indicator for testing the stability
    of classification. The F1 score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating
    better classification performance. 3. Results 3.1. Cropland Base Map The cropland
    base map without roads and irrigation ditches was generated through the two steps
    introduced in Section 2.3. As a result, the boundaries of fields are more prominent,
    and the problem of adhesion between field pixels in the study area is eliminated,
    as shown in Figure 4. There are 887,938.39 hectares of cropland in the study area.
    In addition, the area calculated from remote sensing results was compared with
    the data of The Third National Land Survey of China in 2020; a minimal difference
    between the modified cropland area and that of in land survey was found, and the
    specific data are relevant in Table 1. Therefore, the cropland base map is reliable
    and can be a basis for consecutive research. Figure 4. Cropland distribution in
    HID, (a) HID base map of modified cropland, (b) detailed map of initial cropland
    of ESA WorldCover global land cover data at 10 m resolution, (c) detailed SHP
    file of roads and ditches downloaded from AutoNavi Electronic Maps, (d) detailed
    map of modified cropland at 10 m resolution. Table 1. Cropland area derived from
    remote sensing data and areas included in The Third National Land Survey. 3.2.
    Sample Validity Test The samples’ pixel reflectance means values derived from
    the ten spectral bands of Sentinel-2 were acquired during the mapping period in
    this study (from March to April). Then, Origin 2018 was used to generate the Q-Q
    plot diagrams of the values of non-saline and saline cropland samples, as shown
    in Figure A1. In addition, the R-square (R2) between the normal data quantiles
    and normal theoretical quantiles is a practical approach to showing the validity
    of samples. The specific R2 values can be found in Table 2. Table 2. R2 values
    between normal data quantiles and normal theoretical quantiles of samples for
    the various bands of the Sentinel-2 image. It can be found that the samples of
    either non-saline or saline cropland obey the normal distribution in the validation
    results. The scatter points in the Q-Q diagram of the saline and non-saline cropland
    before the growing season (from March to April) tend to fall on the x = y reference
    line, and the R2 of all sample data is above 0.9. Whereas, the R2 values of both
    non-saline and saline cropland samples on the B2 appear lowest (0.93 and 0.90,
    respectively) in all bands. This is because salt-affected soil has a valley of
    absorption close to the blue wavelength. Because of this, the reflectance is also
    lower than at other wavelengths. The sample points on the other bands in Figure
    A1 lie on the line x = y except for the B2 band, demonstrating the linear relationship
    between the normal data quantiles and the normal theoretical quantiles. This indicates
    a high level of sample consistency between two distributions of sample data on
    the B3 to B12 (Green to SWIR2) bands. The results of the sample validity test
    show that the samples chosen in this study for two cropland classes before the
    growing season have adequate consistency and representativeness to meet the needs
    of the subsequent research. 3.3. Accuracy Assessment of Saline Cropland Mapping
    The other probability of mapping saline cropland in the dry or wet season was
    tested in this part. According to observing the total precipitation in the last
    decade (chart in Figure 1a), the precipitation peaks in August and September and
    has been set in the wet season, while there was less precipitation from March
    to April and can be set as the dry season. Therefore, the accuracies of each dataset,
    including (1) the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization VV + VH dataset, (2) textures of
    Sentinel-2 B2 band, (3) Sentinel-2 spectral band dataset, (4) indices built based
    on Sentinel-2, and (5) the dataset of combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 in different
    time intervals were assessed to present the performance of the modeling strategies
    in the dry and wet season. The box plot of validation results are presented in
    Figure A2, and the validation indicators are shown in Table A3. The results showed
    that the highest accuracy was achieved In the dry season from March to April,
    which was significantly higher than other time interval combinations. In comparison,
    no significant difference has been observed in the box plot of March, August and
    August to September. The result indicates that the two-month data combination
    in the dry season is the best solution for mapping saline cropland in HID. Thus,
    the dataset combined with March and April generated the salt-affected cropland
    map. Moreover, to clarify the best multi-variables with the highest accuracy for
    saline cropland mapping, the performances of the variables and their combinations
    were estimated, respectively, as shown in Figure 5 and Table A4. Figure 5. Classification
    accuracies of each variable and the combined datasets: Sentinel-1 indicates the
    mean value of Sentinel-1 dual-PolSAR (VV + VH) bands; Sentinel-2 suggests the
    combination of texture and indices derived from reflectance bands of Sentinel-2
    and original mean values of spectral bands. S1_S2 combined indicates the combination
    of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets. As shown in Figure 5 and Table A4, the
    B2 band reflectance showed the highest accuracy (OA = 0.80) in the spectral bands
    of the Sentinel-2 data, which was followed by the B3 band. The Red Edge wavelength
    range is considered sensitive to green plants’ growth status [55]. Thus, the B5,
    B6 and B7 bands of Sentinel-2 data showed no obvious advantage for salt-affected
    soil mapping at 20 m resolution in this case, as shown in Figure 5. Notably, the
    visible band has higher advantages for identifying salt-affected soil than the
    Infrared band in the dry season. The VV + VH dual-polarization backscattering
    signal of Sentinel-1 data did not show competitive accuracy assessment results,
    with an overall accuracy of 0.68. The accuracy of the VH backscattering signal
    was higher than the VV backscattering signal, reaching 0.67 and 0.58, respectively.
    In addition, it can be seen in Table A4 that a very slight improvement (0.0019)
    has been detected in the assessment results by adding Sentinel-1 SAR data to Sentinel-2
    spectral data. In this case, the mapping of salinity-affected crops is not significantly
    impacted by the VV + VH dual-polarization backscattering information. SAR data,
    however, can also be an essential supplemental data source in overcast and rainy
    regions where continuous optical images are challenging to obtain. Each index
    variable’s OA was greater than 70%, which denotes high accuracy. With an OA of
    0.79, SI had the highest accuracy of any index, which was followed by MSAVI with
    an OA of 0.72. The degrees of accuracy for NDVI, SAVI, OSAVI, NDSI, and DVI are
    equivalent. These findings suggest that SI is the most appropriate indicator for
    saline cropland in salt-affected cropland mapping before the growing season in
    an arid and semi-arid region. In this situation, combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    (S1_S2 combined in Figure 5), modeling strategies provided the optimal solution
    for saline cropland mapping, with an OA of 0.8938. 3.4. The Map of Saline Cropland
    The dataset, including the spectrum reflectance, indices, texture information
    and PolSAR backscattering signal, produced the highest overall accuracy and F1
    score (non-saline cropland is 0.91 and saline cropland is 0.87). Therefore, the
    Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 combined datasets were selected for mapping the saline
    cropland before the growing season in HID. Furthermore, the cropland in HID was
    classified into two categories, as aforementioned. As seen in Figure 6, the amount
    of non-saline cropland in HID is more than the area of saline cropland, with 58.30%
    and 41.70% of cropland, respectively. The stretch between Wuyuan County to the
    west bank of Ulansuhai Nur is the largest saline cropland zone in HID. Additionally,
    the concentration of saline soil increases with proximity to the Yellow River
    Basin. As seen in Figure 6, the cropland is generally dispersed in strips toward
    the south and north to the east of Ulansuhai Nur. The majority of the cropland
    in the north uses drip irrigation, and some portions are watered by groundwater.
    Figure 6. The distribution of non-saline and saline cropland with the percentage
    pie chart. In contrast, the salinization is relatively high in the area irrigated
    mainly by the Yellow River in the south. As a result, there is less salinization
    than in the southern region. Numerous studies have shown that flood irrigating
    with Yellow River water causes soil salinization in HID. Therefore, the higher
    salinization is in keeping with the actual situation in areas irrigated with water
    from the Yellow River. 4. Discussion 4.1. Indices in Salt-Affected Cropland Mapping
    Index variables were important in previous research on salt-affected soil monitoring
    and inversion. The analysis based on SI-MSAVI is the most renowned among them
    and has been shown to invert soil salinity [56,57,58] accurately. Likewise, NDVI
    and DVI, commonly used to monitor vegetation status, are also widely used in land
    salinization monitoring research and are critical indicators [59,60,61]. A mapping
    methodology for salinized cropland was developed in this study using several variables
    based on two bands (see Table A2 for details). The Red and NIR bands produce all
    other indices besides the SI. Figure 7 shows that even though the saline and non-saline
    samples have clear absorption valleys in the visible wavelength range, their reflectance
    values significantly differ. In comparison, the reflectance value in the NIR wavelength
    range is relatively high, but no clear difference has been observed. Near the
    two bands of water vapor (945 nm) and cirrus (1375 nm) of the Sentinel-2 image,
    there are more wide absorption valleys but practically overlapping curves in the
    SWIR wavelength range; however, near the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands, the difference
    becomes more evident. Nevertheless, when employing a single SWIR band for accuracy
    assessment, the result does not achieve the high accuracy of the visible band
    due to the SWIR band’s resolution of 20 m. Figure 7. Reflectance curve of non-saline
    and saline cropland samples over the wavelength range of Sentinel-2 data in dry
    season. Commonly, SI measures the direct relationship between Electrical Conductivity
    (EC) and moisture. This ratio shows the salinity concentration in the available
    water [62]. By utilizing the more pronounced differences between the two cropland
    sample types in the Blue and Red bands, the SI index based on the visible band
    in this study was the variable with the highest contribution and achieved higher
    classification accuracy. However, other indices have similar classification accuracy
    since they are both constructed from red and NIR bands. While NDVI and NDSI represent
    normalized differences between the Red and NIR bands of the Sentinel-2 image,
    NDVI is the NIR minus the Red and NDSI is the inverse. Thus, a positive value
    of NDVI and a negative value of NDSI at the same pixel are equivalent. However,
    when NDVI or NDSI are not employed, the overall accuracy of the salt-affected
    cropland mapping slightly decreases (the accuracy decreases by 0.0019 when NDVI
    is removed, and the accuracy drops by 0.0058 when NDSI is removed). Consequently,
    NDVI and NDSI have equal correlation coefficients with the sample data, which
    means positive correlation coefficients for NDVI and negative correlation coefficients
    for NDSI). Additionally, NDSI was found to be more sensitive for detecting saline
    cropland in the wet season with OA at 0.66, which is slightly higher than the
    accuracy that NDVI can achieve in the wet season with OA at 0.65. 4.2. Multi-Sensor
    Data Application in Saline Cropland Mapping Soil salinization is a severe problem
    faced by land worldwide, and the affected area is vast [18]. However, there is
    no exact standard for monitoring solutions due to different data sources and statistical
    methods. Unlike non-salt-affected land and other ground features, soil salinization
    has distinct and unique spectral reflectance characteristics and tends to show
    higher reflectance on spectral images [40,63,64,65]. Satellite remote sensing
    technology has irreplaceable advantages (near real-time and covering a large area)
    and good application prospects for observing soil salinity. Therefore, using multispectral
    remote sensing images to monitor the soil-affected cropland in an area with complex
    land surface objects is feasible. On the other hand, microwave remote sensing
    has been widely used in the inversion of surface soil moisture and salinity for
    a long time [66,67]. Since the C-band polarization radar data of the Sentinel-1
    satellite was introduced into civilian use, some breakthroughs have been made
    in soil moisture inversion research at the beginning [68,69]. However, the salinity
    change in the soil surface will affect the soil dielectric properties and thus
    will change the microwave emissivity of the land surface. Therefore, in addition
    to considering the impact of soil moisture alone, soil salinity has to be considered
    in areas with severe soil salinization [70,71,72]. As a result, the study of monitoring
    soil salinity using microwave remote sensing data has gradually attracted extensive
    attention [73,74]. The method combining the optical and microwave remote sensing
    data has been discussed preliminary in this study. However, many studies have
    shown that the identification ability of the backscattering coefficient will be
    significantly enhanced after the polarization decomposition of radar data. Nevertheless,
    the importance of radar data in this study is still minimal, which may be because
    the eigenvalues after polarization decomposition are more advantageous for identifying
    salt on the soil surface than the original backscattering coefficient. The GRD
    data provided in GEE do not have phase information, so it is impossible to realize
    GEE’s polarization decomposition. Hence, it is difficult to establish the eigenvalues
    after polarization decomposition in a large area to extract saline cropland. The
    application of remote sensing to earth observation is an essential means to understand
    the earth and study various natural phenomena in the future. Remote sensing technology
    is constantly developing, including many commercial satellite programs. As a result,
    the earth will be observed without a dead angle. In addition, the data volume
    will increase in geometric multiples; managing and using data efficiently and
    reasonably will be both a challenge and an opportunity for developing various
    algorithms and applications for salt-affected cropland monitoring. 4.3. Strongly
    Saline Cropland Abandonment in HID The ESA WorldCover global land cover data did
    not recognize some fields with severe salinization as cropland. However, it is
    a minor error, because these have been abandoned for many years. On the other
    hand, a few severely salinized croplands have been planted late for sunflower
    seeds because of their salt tolerance [75]. In either case, it points to the severely
    salinized cropland in HID under the high potential abandonment stress. Soil salinization
    has become an essential topic of global change research. The latest research shows
    that global soil salinization will be characterized by regional prominence, global
    intensification, and the coexistence of local salinization and intensification.
    Severely salinization is one of the most hazardous reasons why cropland is removed
    from production and then causes the abandonment globally of 0.3–1.5 million hectares
    per year [76]. It is generally recognized that a large proportion of salt-affected
    soils in irrigated areas occurs on land inhabited by smallholder farmers. However,
    salt-affected cropland degradation’s social and economic dimensions have received
    little attention compared to its biophysical aspects [77]. Well-known examples
    of salt-induced land degradation include the Aral Sea Basin (Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya
    River Basins) in Central Asian countries, the Indo-Gangetic Basin in India, the
    Indus Basin in Pakistan, the Yellow River Basin in China, the Euphrates Basin
    in Syria and Iraq, the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia, and the San Joaquin
    Valley in the United States. Severe salinity also reduces paddy yields in many
    previously productive land areas; many paddy fields in Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lanka,
    have been abandoned and are currently becoming shrubland [78]. Nevertheless, there
    has been no comprehensive study on the contribution of soil salinity to reduced
    agricultural productivity and the abandonment of paddy lands in a region. A study
    based on the analysis of the spatiotemporal variation in cropland expansion and
    loss in Xinjiang over 20 years found that the abandonment was the primary reason
    for the loss of cropland, with soil salinization playing an increasingly major
    role in the cropland abandonment [79]. Furthermore, Wu et al. [80] found widespread
    abandonment of reclaimed land and tillage in Xinjiang. A major reason for this
    abandonment was soil salinization with as much as 12,680 km2 of cropland being
    affected. There was a strong sense of expansion in the land use pattern of humanity
    with a poor understanding of sustainable development in the last few decades in
    Inner Mongolia. As a result, the saline bare land in northeast China has been
    utilized to a certain extent. However, due to the lack of protective technology,
    paddy fields’ abandonment and salinization reappearance have also occurred in
    some areas after the high-intensity utilization of cropland. The extensive area
    saline cropland treatment was also implemented in 2022 with the government’s support
    since the abandoned cropland is an essential reserve in China. The efficient utilization
    of salinized land is vital to ensure national food security, especially under
    the current COVID-19 pandemic and the global background of frequent disasters;
    it is imminent to utilize the reserve cropland and control the salinity. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, after manual visual selection of samples, creation of a cropland
    base map of HID, and sample validity testing, a saline cropland identification
    model based on multi-sensor remote sensing data and the multi-variable dataset
    was built and achieved with high classification accuracy. One of these, the sample
    validity test method, was used for the first time in the saline cropland monitoring
    study and produced promising experimental results. The multi-variable dataset
    based on Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images from March to April
    furthermore exhibits strong performance in the remote sensing mapping of salt-affected
    crops. The methodology and results reported in this study may be advantageous
    for mapping saline cropland before the growing season in arid and semi-arid regions.
    They can therefore be encouraged and utilized in a broader area. Supplementary

  description: Currently, smart farming has been established to realize agriculture
    automation by leveraging sensors to gather the growth and environmental data for
    crops, and realizing multiple intelligent controls, such as irrigation, fertilization,
    and so on, to increase the crop yields. To support real-time intelligent controls,
    edge computing is introduced to smart farming by endowing computing and storage
    capacities to edge devices nearby the geographically distributed sensors. However,
    the farmers are relatively willing to purchase and deploy a small quantity of
    edge servers (ESs) in the farm from the perspective of expenditure saving, thereby
    leading to a key challenge to guarantee the performance of the real-time controls
    and the overall edge services. In view of this challenge, a service offloading-oriented
    ES placement method for supporting smart farming, called SOP, is proposed to optimize
    the data transmission delay from sensors to ESs and the load balance among ESs.
    More precisely, the corresponding service range of a certain ES is ascertained
    according to the specific analysis of the farming service requirements. Subsequently,
    the layout policies for the trade-offs of the ES performance and service efficiency
    are acquired. Then the most balanced policy is determined as the final ES placement
    strategy. Eventually, we evaluate the performance of the whole ES system and the
    service execution efficiency with SOP.

    as irrigation, fertilization, and so on, to increase the crop yields. To support
    real-time intelligent controls, edge computing is introduced to smart farming
    by endowing computing and storage capacities to edge devices nearby the geographically
    distributed sensors. However, the farmers are relatively willing to purchase and
    deploy a small quantity of edge servers (ESs) in the farm from the perspective
    of expenditure saving, thereby leading to a key challenge to guarantee the performance
    of the real-time controls and the overall edge services. In view of this challenge,
    a service offloading-oriented ES placement method for supporting smart farming,
    called SOP, is proposed to optimize the data transmission delay from sensors to
    ESs and the load balance among ESs. More precisely, the corresponding service
    range of a certain ES is ascertained according to the specific analysis of the
    farming service requirements. Subsequently, the layout policies for the trade-offs
    of the ES performance and service efficiency are acquired. Then the most balanced
    policy is determined as the final ES placement strategy. Eventually, we evaluate
    the performance of the whole ES system and the service execution efficiency with
    SOP. 1 INTRODUCTION Agriculture, as one of the most essential industries in the
    world, produces plenty of indispensable resources like food, fiber and energy
    for living.1 In the last few decades, agriculture is faced with some problems
    including deficient water provision, attacks by pests, severe weather, and so
    on, which leads to the drop in the crop production.2 Confronted with the unpredictable
    environmental changes, farmers are required to make corresponding measures to
    increase the irrigation, sprinkle pesticide, adjust the humidity or change the
    illumination for guaranteeing crops yields. Benefiting from the reasonable adjustments
    by farmers, the aforementioned problems are handled to some extent. However, the
    constant manual detecting of crops to gain the agricultural information is barely
    realized, since the absence of farmers is likely to take place.3 With the intention
    of liberating farmers and monitoring crops accurately, smart farming is emerging
    to provision monitor and control capabilities in the farming procedure.4 Consequently,
    multiple smart devices and sensors are deployed in the rural areas to collect
    the agricultural information for further analysis.5 With the import of Internet
    of Things (IoT), the sensors in the farm are connected with each other to monitor
    the environmental situations and instruct the smart devices deployed around the
    crops through wireline and wireless communication.6, 7 However, along with the
    ever-increasing sensor scales, a huge amount of accumulated sensoring data are
    generated which urgently demand massive computing resources for processing, while
    it is approximately impossible to undergo such computation-intensive data analysis
    on the local resource-constrained sensors. To eliminate the computation and storage
    pressure for the sensors, cloud computing paradigm is introduced in smart farming.
    The gathered data are transmitted to the cloud platform for its powerful and elastic
    storage and computing capabilities.8 By achieving on-demand resource provisioning
    for the sensors located at the crop side, the collected data are stored on the
    centralized data center. Benefiting from analysis and mining of such data, a collection
    of the instructions to prompt the health growth of the crops are devised for long-range
    control of the intelligent devices. Nevertheless, for the relative long-transmission
    distance between the crop side and the cloud, the performance of controlling smart
    devices around the crops is severely affected.9 Currently, a wide range of sensors
    in IoT choose to dispatch their data to the cloud platform, which accordingly
    brings about the worse transmission performance between the cloud platforms and
    the smart devices. To mitigate the transmission pressure, edge computing emerges
    as a significant paradigm of great concern to accomplish real-time controls.10,
    11 Technically, edge computing extends the computing and storage capabilities
    to edge servers (ESs) which are deployed together with some sensors for evaluating
    the status of crops by handling the gathered data on the edge.12 Besides, to cope
    with the environmental changes, the control modules are embedded in ESs. Thus,
    ESs possess the ability to control the smart devices timely.13 In reality, considering
    the exorbitant expenditure of purchasing ESs, farmers prefer to leverage a small
    quantity of ESs, which results in the difficulty of guaranteeing the performance
    of the real-time controls and the overall edge services. Most sensors have no
    ES close by on account of a small quantity of ESs placement, which causes unavoidable
    transmission delay between ESs and sensors. Besides, the computing resources in
    ESs are limited, so ESs are incapable of responding to superabundant data-processing
    demands from sensors, which brings about the delay of a few computing applications
    waiting in ESs for processing. On the other hand, for insuring the performance
    and the stability of the edge service system, the load balance for all ESs is
    urgent to be realized. With the above observations, it is indeed a challenge to
    realize the rational placement of ES to enhance the performance of the real-time
    controls and the overall edge services with the aim of reducing the delay and
    achieving the load balance. In this article, a service offloading-oriented ES
    placement method for supporting edge computing in smart farming called SOP is
    devised to address the above challenge. In summary, the main contributions are
    presented as follows. The corresponding service range of a certain ES is ascertained
    according to the specific analysis of the farming service requirements. The layout
    policies for the trade-offs of the ES performance and service efficiency are acquired
    by the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The most balanced
    layout policy is identified as the final ES layout strategy through utility value
    analysis. A large number of experimental evaluations are conducted to evaluate
    the performance of the whole ES system and the service execution efficiency with
    SOP. The remaining of this article is organized as four sections. In Section 2,
    the system model is shown. In Section 8, a service offloading-oriented ES placement
    method in smart farming is designed. In Section 17, the simulation experiments
    are underwent. In Section 25, related works are summarized. In Section 26, conclusions
    and future work are outlined. 2 SYSTEM MODEL In this section, a system model for
    placing ESs in rural areas is proposed to evaluate the data transmission delay
    from sensors to ESs and the load balance among ESs in smart farming. Key terms

    section, the service offloading oriented edge computing architecture for smart
    farming is discussed in Figure 1. Two layers, including the sensor layer and the
    service layer, compose the architecture. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    An service offloading oriented edge computing architecture for smart farming [Color
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] In the sensor layer, sensors are
    placed nearby the crops to collect the data of temperature, irrigation, illumination,
    precipitation, and so on, which are denoted as . However, sensors are unable to
    process the massive collected data. Therefore, edge computing extends the computing
    and storage capacity to ESs for helping sensor process the data. In the service
    layer, ESs are placed close to sensors for helping process the data, which are
    denoted as . The computing resources for ESs are measured by virtual machines
    (VMs). VMs are denoted as which mean that the mth sensor has W VMs. In addition,
    the number of sensors which is certain is defaulted as N, while the number of
    ESs is uncertain. In our framework, the sensors and ESs are connected by a low
    power wireless personal area network (LoWPAN) for it is capable of low computation
    processing and low power consuming.14 Besides, if all the VMs in the ESs are occupied,
    data which are not dealt yet enter the queue in ES and wait for processing. In
    case of ESs handling all data from sensors, they are capable of commanding sensors
    to strengthen irrigation, illumination, fertilization, and so on. Besides, the
    monitor also has the ability to acknowledge the situation in rural areas. After
    this, the farmers can make a choice for demanding enhancing the temperature, irrigation,
    illumination, precipitation, and so on. In addition, the remote cloud offers the
    advice and make the forecast by consulting the results. 2.2 Delay model When an
    ES deals with data from a sensor, the delay consists of the offloading time from
    the sensor to the ES, the executing time for ES processing the data, the waiting
    time in the queue and the transmitting time during the process of sending the
    results to the sensor. Considering each sensor is only able to detect the environmental
    information within a certain range, so we denote the ranges of sensors are denoted
    as , respectively, for convenient calculation. Suppose that ES is not always placed
    in the range of sensors. A binary variable is leveraged to judge whether the mth
    (1≤m≤M) ES em is in the range of the nth (1≤n≤N) sensor sn, denoted as (1) The
    time for offloading the data from the sensor sn to the ES em is calculated by
    (2) where dsn is the data size of the data from the sensor sn, λl is the data
    transmission rate by using LoWPAN and θn represents the number of the ESs which
    data are transmitted through. The executing time for the ESs to process the data
    from the sensor sn is calculated by (3) where run represents the resource units
    demanded by the data from the sensor sn and p represents the processing power
    of each resource unit. Before calculating the waiting time, the waiting rounds
    are described as (4) where wtm represents the wait rounds in the mth ES em. The
    waiting time of data from the sensor sn in the queue is calculated by (5) where
    ETz represents the respective executing time for all data processed in this ES
    at zth round. The transmitting time during the process of sending the results
    to the sensor from the ES em is calculated by (6) where is the result size from
    em. The total delay for implementing the data from the sensor sn is calculated
    by (7) Then, the average delay for implementing the data from all sensors is calculated
    by (8) 2.3 Load balance model In the load balance model, the capacity of ESs and
    the computing resource requirement of data are measured by the VMs'' number. A
    binary variable is used to judge whether the mth ES em has been occupied, which
    is deduced by (9) There is also a binary variable to judge whether the nth sensor
    sn offloads the data to the mth ES em, that are defined by (10) In case of that
    the number of the occupied ES is certain, it is feasible to count the computing
    resource usage of ESs. Hence, the number of ESs that are occupied is calculated
    by (11) The usage of the computing resources in the mth ES em is measured by the
    usage of VMs instances. (12) where represents the number of the employed VM instances
    in the ES em at the zth round. Thus, the average usage of the computing resources
    in ESs is determined by (13) With the previous paving, the load variance of the
    ES computing resource usage is calculated by (14) Eventually, the overall load
    variance for the whole ESs is deduced by (15) 2.4 Energy emission model First,
    we put forward two binary variables: one is utilized for judging whether the mth
    ES em disposes the data from the sensor sn and the other is utilized for judging
    the round, described as follows. (16) and (17) The time of the mth ES em providing
    services, which determines the total energy consumption, is calculated by (18)
    Let ρ be the power rate of the ES. The baseline energy cost for keeping the ESs
    running is calculated by (19) Let σ be the energy emission rate of the engaged
    resource units, and the relevant energy cost is determined by (20) where ruz is
    the number of the used resource units in the round z. Let ψ be the energy emission
    rate of the unoccupied units, and their corresponding energy cost is calculated
    by (21) Thus, the overall energy consumption of the ESs is givens as (22) 2.5
    Problem definition The goal is to realize multiple optimizations for minimum latency
    in (8), load balance variance in (15), and energy consumption minimization in
    (22) when placing ESs in the farm. The multiobjective problem is denoted as (23)
    (24) (25) The formulation (24) makes sure that the ES amount is less than the
    sensor amount. In addition, the formulation (25) means that the total required
    computational resource for all the data from sensors is less than the capacity
    of all ESs. 3 A SERVICE OFFLOADING-ORIENTED ES PLACEMENT METHOD 3.1 Service range
    and routing confirmation of ESs In this section, an algorithm for service range
    and routing confirmation of ESs when the number of ESs is determined is discussed.
    We first introduce an instance, and then the universal algorithm is introduced
    according to the instance. The instance is that nine sensors are placed in rural
    areas, denoted as . In view of that the situation where there is only one ES in
    the farm is too simple (every sensor offloads its data to the only ES), the situation
    where two ESs are placed in the farm is used as an example: two ESs, denoted as
    e1 and e2, are placed in the range of s3 and s5, respectively. The confirmation
    of ESs'' service range and routing for this example is: s3 and s5 offload data
    to e1 and e2, respectively. Then the other sensors count the distance to e1 and
    e2. The data from the sensor which has the minimal distance are considered to
    be offloaded: s2, s4, s6, and s8. The key is the allocation of data from s2 and
    s6 in case of that the distances from s2 and s6 to e1 and e2, respectively are
    the same. We consider using a decision tree to store the data transmission routes
    across the sensors. The data in s4 and s8 are offloaded to d2 directly. At this
    time, if the data in s2 and s6 are offloaded to e2, the values of the delay and
    the load balance variance can''t be the most ideal. And then those data in s2
    and s6 are offloaded to e1. After that, there are still several tasks needed to
    be offloaded. The rule is that the distance is the priority. However, the distances
    from s1, s7, and s9 to e2 are all the same, while the distance from s7 to e1 is
    longer than those from s1 and s9 to e1. For minimizing the delay, the data from
    s7 is offloaded to e2. Then for minimizing the load balance variance in ESs and
    balancing the balanced binary tree, data from s1 and s7 is offloaded to e1. Even
    though, when the number of sensors becomes larger, the situation of all VMs in
    an ES being occupied has the possibility to occur. Then the data enter the queue
    and wait for being processed. On account of the sensor placemen in the farm being
    regular, we decide to see the rural areas as a 3×3 square grid and a 3×3 matrix,
    employed to calculate the distance between the sensor and the ES easily. Furthermore,
    the data transmission routes across the sensors are shown in Figure 2A and the
    constructed decision tree is shown in Figure 2B. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer

    nine sensors (ie, s1 to s9) and 2 ESs (ie, e1 and e2). ES, edge server [Color
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The universal algorithm is shown
    in Algorithm 1. In the algorithm, each sensor uses a flag to indicate whether
    it has offloaded the data to an ES. First, the flags for sensors are initialized.
    Then, ESs are placed close to sensors randomly. In addition, sensors offload the
    data to the corresponding ES. Finally, sensors that has not offloaded data choose
    the ES to offload according to the decision tree. Algorithm 1. Service Range and
    Routing Confirmation of Edge Servers 3.2 ES layout policy acquisition To acquire
    the ES layout policies, improving the ES performance (ie, the load balance and
    energy conservation) and the service implementation time are key criteria. To
    collaboratively promoting these criteria, the evolutional algorithm NSGA-II is
    imported, since it is efficient in multiobjective optimization. In this phase,
    ESs in are encoded. In the genetic algorithm (GA), each ES placement is represented
    by a gene. Because the number of ESs is M, M genes compose a chromosome, which
    compose a chromosome specified through integer representation with the range [1,
    N]. The encoding operation is presented in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2. Encoding
    for ESs In addition, the fitness functions are used to search for the optimal
    solution for the multiobjective optimization. Here, delay, load balance variance
    and energy cost are the three considered aspects which are presented in (8), (15),
    and (22), respectively. We aim at chasing down the hybrid ES placement strategies
    with the minimum delay, the minimum load variance and the minimum energy cost.
    Under the constraints given by (24) and (25), the trade-offs between the three
    objectives are looking forward to be realized. Before carrying out NSGA-II, the
    parameters of GA are set in advance in this phase. The size of the population
    is denoted as P, and the maximum iteration is denoted as I. In addition, the crossover
    and mutation probability are pc and pm, respectively. The gene which is denoted
    as gp,n represents the nth ES placement strategy in the pth chromosome. So let
    represent the pth chromosome. The populations Ap and Bp, whose sizes are both
    P, are randomly generated. Then, the population Cp with size 2P is formed. Next,
    the crossover and mutation operations are executed to prepare for the selection
    operation. The goal of the crossover operation is to obtain the better offspring
    by combing the two parent chromosomes. First, selecting the crossover point in
    the chromosome is necessary. Then, swapping two parent genes which are on the
    point''s two sides is conducted. Finally, completing the crossover operation is
    realized. Then, for avoiding the early convergence, the mutation operation is
    used to modify some genes slightly. After the mutation operation, each gene is
    modified with the same possibility. Finally, the selection operation is utilized
    for finding out the balanced ES placement strategies. In the selection operation,
    some chromosomes are selected to accomplish recombining for generating the next
    population. The next population realizes the crossover operation and mutation
    operation. After this, a new population whose population size is 2P with better
    fitness is generated. The fast nondominated sorting approach is employed to help
    this population generate the multiple nondominated layers. Besides, in each layer,
    all individuals have a crowding distance which is computed, respectively. The
    NSGA-II selection method is based on the comparison of the crowded distance operator.
    After the calculation of the crowding distance, more appropriate individuals are
    appropriate are employed to generate the elite population by (26) where ig represents
    the crowding distance with the ES placement strategy gp,n. While , , and represent
    the objective functions, that is, the delay, the load balance variance, and the
    energy consumption, respectively. Besides, Di+1, Li+1, and Ei+1 represent the
    values of the delay, load balance variance and energy consumption objective functions
    with (i+1)th offloading strategy, respectively, and Di−1, Li−1, and Ei−1 is the
    delay, load balance and energy emission by the (i−1)th placement strategy, respectively.
    In our article, we aim at minimizing of the delay, the load variance and the energy
    cost of ESs when ESs placements are determined. NSGA-II is fully leveraged in
    case of its function for addressing the multiobjective optimization problem. The
    overview of ES layout strategies acquisition based on NSGA-II is illustrated in
    Algorithm 3. Algorithm 3. ES Layout Policy Acquisition Using NSGA-II 3.3 Optimal
    ES placement strategy confirmation Our method aims to find the most optimal ES
    placement strategy which achieves the trade-offs among the delay, the load variance
    and the energy cost. SAW and MCDM are utilized to obtain the most balanced ES
    layout policy generated by NSGA-II. The normalized delay and load balance are
    calculated by (27) and (28) and (29) where ADmax, ADmin, ALmax, ALmin, AEmax and
    AEmin are the maximum and minimum delay, load variance, and energy cost, respectively,
    in the population after the selection operation. Then, the utility value is used
    to judge whether the placement strategy is optimal by considering the delay, the
    energy cost and the load variance. The utility value is calculated by (30) where
    wd, wl, and we represent the weights of the delay, the load variance, and the
    energy cost, respectively. Thus, the placement strategy having the most utility
    value is selected as the most optimal ES placement in our method. 3.4 Method overview
    In this article, to minimize the delay, the energy consumption, and the load balance
    variance, we propose a service offloading-oriented ES placement method, called
    SOP. First, a decision tree is erected for deciding the range service of the ESs.
    Then, NSGA-II is employed to produce the ES layout policies. Finally, SAW and
    MCDM techniques are employed to search for the ideal layout policy. The whole
    procedure of our method is presented in Algorithm 4. The inputs of Algorithm 4
    are sensors, ESs, VMs, the initialized population P and the iteration times I.
    The output is the most optimal placement strategy. Algorithm 4. Selection for
    the Optimal ES Placement Strategy 4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION In this section, experiments
    are implemented to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SOP. 4.1 Simulation
    setup Our experiments examine the performances of the SOP method and comparative
    methods (ie, Greedy-D and Greedy-L) when the ES scale is different. The parameter
    settings in this experiment are shown in Table 2. And two comparative methods
    based on greedy algorithm are presented as follows: Greedy-D: A sensor offloads
    the data to the nearest ES. When the closest ES has no spare computing resources
    for processing the data. The sensor chooses a neighbor ES which has sufficient
    computing resources for the data. This process is repeated until all sensors have
    offloaded the data. Greedy-L: A Sensors offloads the data to the ES whose occupancy
    of VMs is the minimum. When all ESs has the similar occupancy of VMs. The sensor
    chooses a nearest ES to offload the data. This process is repeated until all sensor
    have offloaded the data. TABLE 2. Parameter settings Parameter description Value

    are carried out under the simulation tools based on Cloudsim framework on a PC
    which has Intel Core i7-4720HQ 3.60 GHz processors and 8 GB RAM. The corresponding
    evaluation results are presented in the following phases. 4.2 Performance evaluation
    The goal of SOP is to achieve the trades-offs between minimizing the delay, the
    load balance variance, and the energy consumption. The comparison of the utility
    value for different solutions generated by SOP at different ES scales is shown
    by the six subfigures in Figure 3. From Figure 3, it is intuitive that SOP generates
    three solutions for each ES scale, and we choose the optimal edge sensor location
    with the highest utility value as the decisive ES placement destination, for example,
    in Figure 3A, the solution 2 achieves the highest utility value, so 5 ESs will
    be placed in the obtained sensor locations according to the solution 2. FIGURE

    4.3 Comparison analysis In this section, comparisons between SOP and comparative
    methods (ie, Greedy-D and Greedy-L) for different ES scales under the same experimental
    environment are evaluated particularly. The delay, load variance, and energy cost
    are seen as the priority assessment conditions for evaluating the performance
    of methods. The corresponding results are shown in Figures 4-8, and 9. FIGURE

    4.3.1 Comparison of delay In our experimental environment, the processing power
    of each ES is defaulted as equal. When the range service and routing of ESs have
    been confirmed, the executing time for ES among SOP, Greedy-D and Greedy-L are
    obviously the same. Besides, the amount of data in the up time is GB, the amount
    of data in the down time is KB. Their magnitude difference is too large. Therefore,
    the figure of the executing time and the down time has not been presented alone.
    With the number of ESs increasing, the delay decreases because of data having
    more ESs close by to offload without being offloaded to a long-distant ES. However,
    for Greedy-L, the condition, where data in sensors are sent to a relatively remote
    ES because of the employed VMs in this ES is the minimum, has the ability to happen,
    and this condition causes the high time delay which makes the total delay high.
    In Figures 4, 5, and 6, the up time, the queue time, and the total delay are shown,
    respectively. Intuitively, the ability of SOP optimizing the delay is weaker than
    Greedy-D, and stronger than Greedy-L. 4.3.2 Comparison of ES load In our experiment,
    the load variance is calculated according to the occupied VM amount and the usage
    of the computing resource. The occupancy of VMs for different ESs scales is shown
    in Figure 7. When the ES scale is small, the data wait in the queue for the limited
    computing resources in ESs, so the total rounds for ESs processing data are 7.
    However, with the increasing number of ESs, the total rounds decrease for data
    having more ESs to offload. Besides, the comparison of the resource usage for
    different ES scales between SOP and comparative methods is shown in Figure 8.
    When the ES scale increases, more and more computing resources are vacated. In
    addition, in Figure 9, the load variance with different ES amount by SOP, Greedy-L
    and Greedy-D is presented. Contrary to Greedy-L, Greedy-D aims to optimize the
    delay. This give rise to the condition where data in sensors are transmitted to
    a close ES that is fully occupied, just for low delay, which makes several ESs
    over-used. Intuitively, the ability of SOP optimizing the load balance is weaker
    than Greedy-L, but stronger than Greedy-D. 4.3.3 Comparison of ES energy cost
    There are three sources of energy costs: the baseline energy cost, the energy
    cost of the engaged resource units, and the energy cost of the unoccupied resource
    units. Considering that the ES is scarce and kept in operation mode for consistently,
    the baseline energy consumption of the ES is not considered in the experiment.
    The energy cost of the engaged resources is shown in Figure 10, the energy cost
    of the unengaged resources is shown in Figure 11, and the total energy consumption
    is shown in Figure 12. From these figures, it is visible that SOP is capable of
    reducing the energy consumption to some extent. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer

    4.3.4 Experiments results for optimal ES placement strategy The experiment results
    for the optimal ES placement strategy in different ES scales are shown in Figure
    13, respectively. Theoretically, the ES placement should be symmetry and regular.
    However, in view of that the size of data in different sensor is not always the
    same, the ES placement is asymmetric and irregular. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer

    with the increasing population, the decreasing farmlands, and the villainous climate
    change, feeding billions of people in modern agriculture becomes difficult. Smart
    farming, as a brand-new technology which emphasizes using some information technologies
    such as IoT, is believed to address this challenge.15-17 In smart farming, IoT
    plays a significant role because of its scalability, interoperability and low
    cost.18 IoT extends precision agriculture to smart farming through distributed
    and collaborative sensors, which collect data for processing, sorting and analyzing
    in smart farming to save resources.19 Prathibha et al20 aimed to monitor temperature
    and humidity in rural areas through sensors by using IoT technology. A method,
    which combined IoT technologies and Web Services, was proposed to handle the enormous
    data in smart farming.21 Patil et al22 proposed a remote monitoring system by
    combing internet and wireless communications. Given these facts, adapting IoT
    technologies to smart farming is more and more mature. Meanwhile, other information
    technologies also make a difference in smart farming. Cloud computing, as an important
    technology, is implemented to provide storage and analytics in smart farming due
    to its powerful storage and computing capabilities.23-26 Roy et al27 proposed
    an innovative hybrid system called AgroTick for smart farming. This system utilizes
    technologies like cloud computing and big data analytics based on IoT. AgroTick
    is believed to improve the efficiency of agriculture. Channe et al28 proposed
    a multidisciplinary model based on cloud computing for smart farming. This model
    has the ability to analyze fertilizer requirements, total production prediction
    and market commands. Social sensor cloud was discussed, sensor was proved to be
    a significant element in smart farming.29 However, with the development of smart
    farming, the increasing number of sensors in rural area leads to the generation
    of large amounts of data.30 This makes the applications on the IoT devices have
    large delay and affects the performance of IoT and cloud computing. Furthermore,
    due to the existence of network failures, cloud computing is unable to always
    make timely decisions based on environmental changes in smart farming.31 Edge
    computing, which is able to take advantage of the computing resources in the edge
    of network, is proposed to address the challenges.32-35 In edge computing, cloud
    services, partial analysis, and control functions are extended to the edge nodes
    from the cloud data center.36, 37 Due to this, the latency is reduced obviously
    and the reliability for data transmission is improved, and edge nodes can monitor
    sensors in smart farming timely.38 In view of that, it is urgent to apply edge
    computing to smart farming. Miguel et al proposed a three-tier open source software
    platform and the platform introduced edge computing and fog computing to enhance
    precision agriculture. At the edge level, an NFV-based approach is employed to
    perform local operational decisions, and it mitigate the impact of network failures
    when using cloud data centers.39, 40 A platform, which enables a low-cost sensor/actuator
    network based on IoT, uses edge computing to develop control processed for smart
    farming.41, 42 Currently, few researches guarantee the performance of the real-time
    controls and the overall edge services through ES placement, while it is important
    to consider this, for it may affect the real-time control for making timely decisions
    to the environmental changes in smart farming. Optimizing the delay, energy consumption
    and the load balance through ES placement for enhancing the performance of the
    real-time control is remained as a challenge in smart farming. Therefore, we need
    to make efforts to deal with this challenge. 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Nowadays,
    agriculture is in great crisis for it is facing much problems including water
    scarcity, plague of insects, serve weather, and so on, which rapidly increases
    the crop production. For solving this challenge, edge computing is introduced
    as a considerable technology in smart farming. Edge computing confers the computing
    and storage capacity to ESs, which is capable of real-timely controlling the sensors
    to cope with the situation in the farm. To realize the rational ES placement which
    aims to reduce the delay from sensors to ESs, the load balance and the energy
    consumption among ESs, SOP is proposed in this article. Specifically, a decision
    tree is utilized to determine the data transmission routes of the data in sensors.
    Then, for achieving the multiobjective optimization, NSGA-II is employed. Finally,
    the performance of SOP is evaluated by the experimental analysis. In future work,
    we will try our best to acquire real smart farming datasets and adjust SOP to
    fit the personized real-world smart farming. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported

    these technologies can make the agricultural processes smarter and more cost-efficient

    systems that adopt the traditional cloud-based architecture have provided powerful

    and compared to the traditional implementation. According to the results of thousands
    of agriculture sensors, the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional
    cloud-based architecture in terms of reducing the overall energy consumption by
    36% and the carbon emissions by 43%. In addition to these achievements, the results
    show that our proposed architecture can reduce network traffic by up to 86%, which
    can reduce network congestion. Finally, we develop a heuristic algorithm to validate
    and mimic the presented approach, and it shows comparable results to the MILP
    model.

    of Things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies that promise to transform
    the way on how people work and live. The term IoT refers to a network of physical
    objects “things” that contain embedded systems with connectivity and computing
    power to exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet. By 2025,
    the number of IoT devices connected to the Internet is projected to be 100 billion,
    with an economic impact of more than $ 11 trillion [1]. The recent development
    of IoT devices presents a new dimension in the agriculture field, where the IoT
    has become an ideal choice for smart agriculture due to its highly scalable and
    ubiquitous architecture. Moreover, the IoT-based smart agriculture value is estimated
    to reach $ 18.45 billion in 2022, and 75 million IoT devices are used for the
    agricultural sector in 2020 [2]. Furthermore, smart farms are projected to have
    12 million IoT points by 2023 [3]. Smart agriculture has started incorporating
    IoT solutions to improve operational efficiency, maximize yield, and minimize
    wastage through real-time field data collection, data analysis, and deployment
    of control mechanisms. Also, the diverse of IoT-based applications such as precision
    farming and smart irrigation is very helpful to the enhancement of agricultural
    processes. Thus, the IoT is considered as one of the promising solutions for embracing
    connected farms to address agriculture-based issues and increase the quality and
    quantity of agricultural production. IoT solutions are highly associated with
    cloud computing to process the huge amount of heterogeneous data sent or received
    by agriculture sensors/actuators [4]. Although cloud computing can handle smart
    agriculture applications, some of the applications and services produce a large
    amount of data and need to be processed in a real-time manner, which may cause
    a heavy load on the network, long response time, and poor quality of service,
    due to limited bandwidth [5]. Therefore, using the traditional cloud-based architecture
    may not be efficient to support these applications, which may also result in high
    energy consumption due to the transfer of agriculture data to and from the cloud.
    The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry is projected to account
    for 20% of the global electricity demand by 2025 [5]–[8], [9]. Usually, consuming
    electricity is accompanied by carbon emissions (CO2). fossil fuel usage is the
    primary source of CO2 [10]. Consequently, this causes the growth of carbon dioxide
    emissions. According to [11], ICT uses 730 Million ton (Mt) CO2 equivalents (CO2e)
    or 1.4% of worldwide carbon emissions. To overcome the above shortcomings, edge
    and fog computing architecture are introduced to process the real-time IoT applications
    and services at the proximity of data sources in an efficient way, which have
    several benefits (e.g., reduce energy consumption, network traffic and improve
    quality of service) compared to traditional cloud-based architecture, that does
    not exploit the latest paradigms such as fog and edge in the agriculture system
    [4], [6]. However, edge and fog computing are not a replacement for cloud computing,
    as cloud computing will still be preferable and suitable for analyzing and processing
    heavy tasks, as well as storing data in a long term. The collaboration between
    edge, fog, and cloud computing is the best practice to achieve smart agriculture
    solutions. Several related works in the literature, (e.g. in [12], [13]), have
    discussed various architectures, techniques, and methods applied for smart agriculture
    systems considering different technologies such as IoT, big data analytics, and
    cloud computing. However, none of the existing works focused on the edge-fog-cloud
    architecture intending to reduce the energy consumption, CO2 emission, and network
    traffic as considering the three computing layers (edge, fog, and cloud). Therefore,
    this paper presents a new approach for smart agriculture systems to develop an
    energy-efficient offloading of IoT agriculture applications over an edge-fog-cloud
    computing architecture, according to the resource requirements of each agriculture
    task. Also, this approach could help to enhance the solutions of many traditional
    agriculture issues by taking the advantage of edge and fog computing, which will
    improve the overall energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emission, network traffic
    of smart agriculture systems. The major contributions of this paper are summarized
    as follows: ∙ Develop an energy-efficient architecture based on mathematical modeling
    and heuristic algorithm to study the offloading of IoT applications from agriculture
    sensors to edge, fog, and geo-distributed cloud, while considering minimization
    of the overall power consumption of networking and processing of the IoT agriculture
    services. ∙ Optimize the offloading of IoT agriculture applications over an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture, which connected to the access network, metro area network, and wide
    area network, respectively, thus eliminating the associated power consumption
    and telecommunication network traffic. ∙ Evaluate the usability and the capability
    of the proposed architecture and its models, using the mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) model, and compared the results to the traditional approach. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the edge-fog-cloud
    system architecture and its interaction layers. Section III presents the mixed-integer
    linear programming (MILP) model for optimizing the offloading of IoT agriculture
    applications in the edge-fog-cloud architecture. The model’s design, scenarios,
    and the input parameters of the models are presented in Section IV. This is followed
    by discussing the optimization model results and analysis in Section V. In Section
    VI, we introduce energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic
    over the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC). Finally, Section VII concludes
    the paper and discusses future work. SECTION II. Proposed Architecture for Smart
    Agriculture System Today, the traditional cloud-based architecture for agriculture
    systems is inefficient to satisfy all the requirements of the current scenarios
    [4], [5], [7], [8], as it lacks the essential efficiency prerequisites such as
    energy consumption, CO2 emission, network traffic, and so on [6]. Consequently,
    there is a need to develop an energy-efficient architecture for a smart agriculture
    system to fulfill these requirements. This section provides an outline of the
    proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture and its role in providing dynamicity and
    efficiency based on different IoT agriculture applications. The proposed architecture
    of the smart agriculture system is shown in Fig. 1; and it consists of four essential
    layers, namely, IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. The
    description of each layer of the proposed architecture is presented as follow:
    FIGURE 1. An IoT-based edge-fog-cloud architecture for smart agriculture system.
    Show All A. IoT Sensor Layer IoT sensors generate massive heterogeneous data to
    the gateways by using various sensors deployed in different areas of the agriculture
    field. Also, this layer can receive decisions from to control actuators (e.g.,
    turning on/off irrigation system) [14]. In smart agriculture, there is a range
    of IoT sensor nodes used to identify several phenomena over the urban areas including
    but not limited to soil pH, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity,
    and ambient temperature [15]. In the IoT agriculture system, low power wide area
    (LPWA) technologies have paved the way due to their low power consumption and
    wide area coverage. Long range (LoRa) is proved its efficiency, as a transmission
    protocol for IoT sensors. Besides its low power consumption, it ensures an extent
    of 10 kilometers coverage or more. In addition to LoRa, multiple wireless technologies
    can be used for smart agriculture urban areas such as narrowband (NB)-IoT, WiFi,
    Zigbee, and the 5G. The Zigbee technology has been successfully used in the field
    of agriculture at a low power cost. However, the limited distance coverage for
    wireless data transferring (about 20 meters) is reducing its efficiency. A comprehensive
    comparison of different IoT wireless network technologies (Zigbee, LoRa, NB-IoT,
    and 5G), is presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 IoT Wireless Network Technologies Comparison
    B. Edge Layer Edge computing refers to a new computing model that implements the
    computation of sensors/actuators data at the edge of the network. With this concept,
    some applications and services that do not require a lot of computing resources
    can be processed in the edge layer (close to the data source) and no longer need
    to traverse the network to be processed by the fog or the cloud. Thus, edge computing
    can improve data transmission performance, ensure real-time processing, and reduce
    the computational load as well as the amount of data transmitted to and from the
    fog or cloud data centers [8]. However, in case of unavailability/unsuitability
    of the resources in the edge layer, the sensors will automatically request to
    process their data in the fog or the cloud, and this will be done hierarchically.
    C. Fog Layer The fog computing concept was initially proposed by Cisco in 2014
    to expand the resources of cloud computing to the edge of the telecommunications
    network. In this context, the fog layer has the responsibility to process and
    analyze data sent from IoT sensors, which helps to minimize the latency for agriculture
    applications and services. Also, the fog layer has the ability to process and
    analyze complex data more than the edge layer. Both fog and edge can provide computation,
    networking, and storage services in between the sensor layer and the cloud layer.
    It means that instead of executing all processing at the cloud layer, the fog
    and edge layers can process and analyze agricultural data locally and close to
    the sensor layer (based on their ability) to reduce latency and cost [5], [7].
    D. Cloud Layer At the same level of importance as edge and fog, cloud computing
    is a vital enabler for the growth of IoT agriculture applications. It offers on-demand
    computing resources and services (e.g., storage, networking, and processing) in
    a scalable way. The cloud layer handles the agriculture data received from the
    sensor layer or the fog layer to process, analyze and store them into the cloud.
    Cloud computing can process and analyze heavy data, that requires more complex
    operations (e.g., big data processing and predictive analysis like weather forecasting,
    fire warning, and soil droughting), which exceeds the fog computing capability
    [6]. Also, it could provide a large-scale secure platform and cheap data storage
    services for the IoT agriculture applications [5], [8]. E. Telecommunication Networks
    The traditional telecommunication network architecture consists of three layers
    [16]: the core layer, the metro layer, and the access network layer. The wide
    area network (WAN) is the key network infrastructure that provides interconnection
    between different regions and cities. The Internet protocol (IP) over wavelength
    division multiplexing (WDM) is widely implemented in the core network as it can
    provide high scalability, large capacity, and fast communication network transfer
    speeds. Based on the reference hierarchy in Fig. 1, every core network has a direct
    connection with a metro area network (MAN), which covers a metropolitan area.
    Metro Ethernet is the technology commonly used in the metro network. It offers
    connectivity between the core network and users located in the access network.
    The local area network (LAN) supports Internet access to numerous user premises.
    We adopted the passive optical networks (PONs) which considered as the leading
    networking in the LAN network. SECTION III. MILP Model In this section, a new
    approach is developed based on mathematical mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
    optimization model to study the energy-efficiency of offloading IoT agriculture
    applications over an edge-fog-cloud architecture, considering the three telecom
    network layers: LAN equipped with an edge layer, MAN equipped with a fog layer
    and the WAN equipped with a cloud layer. In the following, we introduce the parameters
    and variables of our proposed architecture. The architecture consists of the IoT
    sensor, edge, fog, and cloud layers. Then, we provide the mathematical model to
    find the optimum distribution of IoT agriculture applications to serve the offloaded
    requests from the IoT sensor layer based on their energy consumption over an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture. A. IoT Sensor Layer The parameters and variables that represent
    the IoT sensor layer, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. TABLE 2 IoT Parameters TABLE

    that will be placed in the edge, fog, or cloud layers, as well as the resulted
    traffic and power consumption. TABLE 4 Cloud, Fog, and Edge Networking and Processing

    Networks As described in Section II-E, a typical telecom network is considered
    including WAN, MAN, and LAN networks. The traffic traverse through these layers
    as well as the corresponding power consumption are represented by the parameters
    and variables described below. 1) Local Area Network (LAN) The parameters and
    variables that define the LAN network are shown in Tables 6 and 7. TABLE 6 LAN

    Carbon emissions [18] can be defined as the carbon emission intensity per an energy
    consumption and the unit of carbon emission intensity is kgCO2e / kWh. The research
    found that using solar, wind or nuclear plants creates a low carbon footprint
    compared with fossil fuels [19]. However, there are multiple limitations to the
    usage of low carbon sources including but not limited to the cost of installing
    these clean plants. Thus, in this work, we assume that only the IoT sensor layer
    and edge layer are powered by low carbon sources (i.e., solar plants panels) to
    reduce the power consumption of the proposed architecture. In the following Tables
    12 and 13, we define parameters and variables related to carbon emissions. TABLE
    12 Emission Parameters TABLE 13 Emission Variables Total carbon emission (CO)
    is composed of: (WAN O)+(MAN O)+(LAN O)+(IoT S) +(Cloud O)+(Fog O)+(Edge S) (26)
    View Source Considering that IoT sensors, gateway, and edge processing layers
    are powered by solar energy sources. While others are powered by oil energy sources.
    SECTION IV. MILP Model Design In this section we explain the scenarios and the
    design of the model conducted in order to evaluate the proposed architecture.
    A. Scenarios As shown in Fig. 1, different scenarios can be implemented with this
    proposed architecture to show its effectiveness. In this work, the following scenarios
    are considered in a hierarchical order based on the edge, fog, and cloud ability.
    Edge/fog layers can be deployed in the proposed architecture according to the
    resources required by the agriculture tasks. Essentially, all tasks from heterogeneous
    IoT devices/sensors in the agriculture field, using different IoT wireless network
    technologies will be offloaded to the network gateways and then directed to edge/fog
    or cloud layer. Each layer has pros and cons. For example, processing the tasks
    within the edge layer will save the power and traffic cost of request transmission
    from/to the fog or cloud layer. However, handling all types of tasks within the
    edge layer is not possible, as it has limited capacity. Therefore, fog and cloud
    layers can be the choice for processing heavy tasks (e.g., resource-intensive
    applications). In our model, we assume that a scheduler in the gateway of the
    IoT layer checks if the edge node has available resources and can handle the request
    of IoT applications (e.g., CPU capability - the number of million instructions
    per second (MIPS)), the tasks will then pass to the edge layer to process them.
    In case of insufficient/unavailability of processing the tasks in the edge layer,
    the request will be transferred to the fog layer and check if there is enough
    capacity. Otherwise, the tasks will be forwarded to the cloud layer for processing,
    which supports resource-intensive applications. Also, we have assumed that the
    cloud has enough resources and capability to handle all kinds of tasks. B. Input
    Parameters of the Models In the MILP model, we have configured four layers in
    a smart agriculture system, which is composed of the IoT sensor layer, edge layer,
    fog layer, and cloud layer. The configuration of edge, fog, and cloud layers depend
    on the type of tasks (e.g., number of MIPS) requested by each IoT sensor/device
    at the IoT sensor layer. The model input parameters of different layers (IoT sensor,
    edge, fog, and cloud layers), in addition to networks and carbon emissions parameters,
    are shown in Tables 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, respectively. TABLE 14 IoT Sensor
    Layer Input Parameters TABLE 15 Cloud, Fog, and Edge Input Parameters TABLE 16
    LAN, MAN, WAN Network Input Parameters TABLE 17 Carbon Emission Inputs for Each
    Fuel Type [17], [22] In our model, we assume that there are 100,000 sensors distributed
    in each farm The sensors task requirements are divided into three types (sensing
    60%, processing 30%, heavy processing 10%). The sensing processing task is usually
    limited to handling offloaded reading data sent by the sensors (e.g., temperature
    reading or send control commands for the irrigation system). The processing task
    is the requirement of light processing (e.g., soil analytics and event detection).
    The heavy processing task is the requisite of higher processing power and resources
    (e.g., weather prediction and analysis). SECTION V. Results and Discussion In
    this section, we discuss the proposed energy-efficient edge-fog-cloud architecture.
    In addition to its energy efficiency, we evaluate our model to find the consequence
    CO2 emission, and network traffic compared to the traditional cloud-based architecture.
    We have evaluated the proposed architecture and models using MILP optimizer based
    on the AT&T network topology, as shown in Fig. 2. To solve the MILP model, we
    use the CPLEX solver over a laptop with an Intel Core i7–7660U CPU, running at
    2.50 GHz, with 16 GB RAM. FIGURE 2. AT&T WAN network topology. Show All As shown
    in Table 1, we have categorized all IoT wireless network technologies used in
    this work based on their data rate, range, number of devices, power consumption
    of both gateway/base-station, and sensors. This work has identified that the power
    consumption of different IoT wireless network technologies almost the same, as
    shown in Fig. 3. The Zigbee technology delivers connectivity with low power consumption
    compared to other technologies. However, using Zigbee in the urban area is not
    the best choice as it only covers 20 meters, thus, hundreds or thousands of gateways
    are required to cover a large area. FIGURE 3. Comparison of different IoT wireless
    network technologies based on their energy consumption. Show All Since we aim
    to use a technology that covers a large area with the least amount of energy consumption.
    Therefore, LoRa has been chosen as an IoT wireless communication technology between
    the IoT sensors and the gateway, that covers long-distance communication, with
    low power consumption, and considers one of the most suitable technology for IoT
    agriculture applications, as shown in Fig. 3. A. Energy Consumption Fig. 4 illustrates
    the power consumptions of different tasks in the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture
    versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. Also, it shows the placement
    location of each task/application in edge-fog-cloud architecture, as well as the
    power consumption values of each task individually. FIGURE 4. The energy consumption
    of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, considering
    the IoT LoRa technology. Show All The results showed that the sensing tasks are
    offloaded to the edge layer, as it has enough capacity (i.e., sensing requires
    500 MIPS, and the edge layer has the capability to process up to 1800 MIPS). The
    normal processing tasks are offloaded to the fog respectively, as the fog layer
    has sufficient resources (i.e., 4000 MIPS) to process the tasks (i.e., 2000 MIPS).
    All remaining requests are offloaded to the cloud layer as there is no capacity
    in edge neither fog layers to accommodate heavy processing tasks. Fig. 5 shows
    the power consumption of our proposed architecture compared to the traditional
    cloud-based architecture, considering different IoT wireless technologies. Also,
    the figure displays power saving achieved by the proposed architecture. It is
    clearly shown that our proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud-based
    architecture by up to 36% of the total power consumption. However, the power savings
    have slightly ranged between 33.6% and 35.6% based on the different IoT wireless
    technologies. The Zigbee shows a higher power saving as it capable of offloading
    sensor data with lower power consumption. FIGURE 5. The energy saving of the proposed
    architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, using different IoT
    wireless technologies. Show All B. CO2 Emission Fig. 6 illustrates the total carbon
    emissions of the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture versus the traditional cloud-based
    architecture, considering powering the IoT sensor layer and edge layer by a solar
    power source. FIGURE 6. The total carbon footprint emission of the proposed architecture
    vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture. Show All It shows that our proposed
    architecture can reduce up to 42% of CO2 emission, for real-time IoT applications
    in agriculture systems. The results also show a comparable carbon emission using
    different IoT wireless technologies. The power consumption of these technologies
    has been eliminated, as all IoT sensors and gateways are power by a solar plant,
    that emits very low carbon footprints (solar plants emit only 0.048 kgCO2/kWh).
    C. Network Traffic Fig. 7 shows the total traffic in each network tier in our
    proposed architecture versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. The results
    showed that our proposed architecture is capable to reduce the total traffic by
    14% and 86% in MAN and WAN tiers, respectively, compared to a cloud-based approach.
    FIGURE 7. The network traffic of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional
    cloud-based architecture. Show All In the traditional cloud-based architecture,
    the process of sending/retrieving the data to/from the cloud in real-time requires
    high-capacity bandwidth, which may cause a burden on the three network tiers.
    Thus, employing edge and fog computing has allowed processing most requests locally
    in edge or fog layers, which significantly decreases the flow of data traverse
    to the cloud and reduces network traffic, as shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Energy
    Efficient Agriculture IoT Edge/Fog/Cloud Architecture Heuristic The problem over
    energy-efficient offloading of IoT applications in edge-fog-cloud architecture
    for smart agriculture environment is a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard
    problem. For instance, if i is IoT applications count and n is the count of locations
    in edge-fog-cloud architecture, then we will have ( ∑ z=1 n n! (n−z)! ) combinations
    of possible applications locations to find the optimum locations that result in
    optimal power consumption. Thus, applying MILP to large-size problems is not feasible.
    Therefore, heuristic provides a simple and fast real-time implementation. Also,
    the optimal solution provided by the heuristic can provide validation to results
    obtained from MILP. To provide that, a heuristic algorithm was developed, referred
    to as energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic over
    the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC). In the EEAIOT-EFC heuristic, IoT
    application i is checked based on their total MIPS processing requirements. Firstly,
    the algorithm tries to place and run the application on the edge layer. If there
    is not enough MIPS capacity at the edge layer, then, agriculture IoT application
    is placed in the fog layer, if it has enough capacity. In case of unavailability
    resources in both edge and fog layers, the cloud layer will host the IoT application,
    as it has enough processing capability to handle all types IoT applications. After
    distributing all IoT applications, the power consumption of EEAIOT-EFC is determined.
    The heuristic flowchart process is shown in Fig. 8. FIGURE 8. Flowchart of EEAIOT-EFC
    heuristic. Show All The heuristic is assessed using a PC with an Intel Core i7–7660U
    CPU, running at 2.50 GHz, with 16 GB RAM. Similar to MILP, the AT&T network is
    considered a WAN network example. The heuristic took 5 seconds to evaluate the
    EEAIOT-EFC, and the MILP and EEAIOT-EFC show a comparable result, as shown in
    Fig. 9. The gaps between them are limited to 0.7% and 4.7% of the total power
    consumption under the proposed and the traditional cloud-based, respectively.
    FIGURE 9. Difference between the MILP model vs. EEAIOT-EFC heuristic. Show All
    SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Works In this paper, the concept of an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture is introduced in the smart agriculture system, which solved existing
    real-time processing issues in terms of reducing energy consumption, CO2 emission,
    and network traffic, compared to the traditional cloud-based architecture. The
    proposed architecture employed the edge and fog layers, which are placed close
    to the agriculture fields to collect heterogeneous data from various kinds of
    IoT agriculture sensors and process them at these layers. Although the proposed
    architecture was significantly reduced the computational load and the amount of
    transmitted data to and from the cloud due to the use of edge and fog layers,
    however, the cloud layer is inevitably used to process the heavy and complex data/task
    requested by IoT agriculture devices/sensors. Most of the processing tasks are
    completed on the edge and fog layers, while few tasks are offloaded to the cloud
    layer for processing. In the paper, different metrics have been taken into consideration,
    including energy consumption, CO2 emission, and network traffic to study the performance
    and the outcomes of the proposed architecture. Using mathematical modeling, the
    proposed architecture is compared with the traditional cloud-based architecture.
    The model results showed that our proposed architecture can reduce the overall
    power consumption, carbon footprints, and network traffic by up to 43%, 36%, 86%,
    respectively. Moreover, we developed energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications
    distribution heuristic over the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC) algorithm,
    which showed comparable results to the MILP model. Though this proposed solution
    is based on the idea of smart agriculture, it also can be suitable for other IoT
    applications and sectors, such as e-healthcare, smart city, and smart home. In
    the future, we intend to extend the proposed approach in a distributed real agricultural
    environment, considering machine-learning and decision-making algorithms to further
    understand the capability of the proposed work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would

    In semi-arid and arid areas, irrigation is an essential practice and efficient
    water applications and management are major concerns. Water applications are used
    in self-propelled center pivot and linear move irrigation systems. Environmental
    impacts, application efficiencies, and yields can be improved by site-specific
    irrigation management. While saving water, quality and yield can be increased
    by the development of distributed in-field sensor-based site-specific irrigation
    system. But the seamless integration of sensor fusion, irrigation control, data
    interface, software design, and communication can be challenging. Microcontrollers
    operating at low cost and data networks are useful in managing the coordination
    of control and instrumentation data. Reusability of common hardware and communication
    protocol can be materialized by adopting a standard interface for sensors and
    actuators. The installation and maintenance costs shoot up by the application
    of a hard-wired system from in-field sensing stations to base station. Normal
    farming operations get disrupted by hard-wiring the system for long distances
    and may not be acceptable to growers. Dynamic mobility and cost-free relocation
    provide a wireless data communication system. Wireless communication products
    used by consumers are established with a radio frequency technology incorporated
    in it. It provides numerous opportunities to use wireless signal communication
    in agricultural systems. According to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 [2], ZigBee is a
    specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols by applying small
    and low-power WPANs [3]. This can be related to the wireless headphones connected
    with the cell phones via short-range radio. ZigBee technology in comparison with
    other WPANs such as Bluetooth is less complex and cheaper. Radio frequency applications
    requiring low data rate, long battery life, and secure networking use ZigBee technology
    [1, 4]. The sensor-based rate irrigation operating at variable conditions prefer
    ZigBee module operations in this project. It functionalizes development, testing,
    and usage of an integrated distributed wireless sensor network. A reduction in
    installation and maintenance costs is possible with the WSN which eliminates the
    need of hard-wiring the sensor stations. Unlike the WLAN, WSN uses an ad hoc network,
    i.e., a mobile wireless network. These ad hoc networks due to their mobility and
    self-configuration find applications in agricultural operations as they are suitable
    for a distributed sensor network. The brief analysis and study of the design,
    construction, and testing of various controls is the ultimate objective of this
    paper. These controls include WSN, remote valve control, motor control, and user-friendly
    software for real-time in-field sensing and control. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1
    Conceptual System Design In-field WSN is illustrated with a conceptual system
    layout in Fig. 1. A base station, irrigation control station and two in-field
    sensing stations are put in use field conditions related to soil moisture, humidity
    and air temperature are monitored through the in-field sensing stations [5]. Wireless
    transmission of in-field sensory data is given to the base station. A user-friendly
    decision-making program is used for the processing of in-field sensory data from
    the base station to the irrigation control station. This control station regulates
    the operation control of valves and motors. Module containing controller, data
    converter, and memory provide row data to ZigBee module to make wireless network.
    A process unit is needed to satisfy the operations of the individual nodes and
    to reduce hardware cost, a common control unit is required [6]. Fig. 1 Conceptual
    system layout of in-field wireless network [2] Full size image Command to generate
    control signals given from the decision-making algorithm and analysis of whole
    network is done through the base station. Storage of sensor data from in-field
    sensing nodes and provision of inter-connectivity is given by a PC-interface.
    2.2 Sensor-Based In-field Station The main components used majorly in this station’s
    operation are three different types of sensors, controllers with data converters,
    and wireless data communication module (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Block diagram of in-field
    sensing station [7] Full size image 2.2.1 Interface-Based Sensing The sensing-based
    operation is performed by connecting an analog output and digital outputs on either
    side. Trouble of voltage range discrepancy occurs due to the fact of us using
    same power supply for analog output with sensors and data converters (Fig. 3).
    Fig. 3 Block diagram of sensor interface with analog output [8] Full size image
    2.2.2 I2c-Bus [9] Transmission of information among devices connected to the bus
    is done via two wires, namely, Serial data wire and serial clock wire. Observing
    the functionality of the system, device can operate as a transmitter or receiver
    by recognizing from its unique address. Initiation of data transfer and generation
    of clock signals are performed by the master device and this establishment satisfies
    the normal operation. 2.2.3 Humidity-Based Sensor [10] A calibrated digital output
    is generated from a module comprising humidity and multi-sensor chip known as
    the SHT71. For high reliability and long-term stability CMOS process with patented
    micromachining is applied. For the sensing of humidity a capacitive polymer sensing
    element and a bandgap temperature sensor is incorporated in the device. These
    sensors are coupled to a serial interface circuit and an ADC converter. 2.2.4
    Soil Moisture-Based Sensor [11] For the measurement of the conductivity of soil
    and keeping it low cost, a simple designed circuit is used rather than a standard
    soil moisture sensor. This operation functions when the soil is wet. The copper
    wires get short and output senses and indicate by jumping to a high position.
    The absence of conductivity between copper wires indicates that the soil is dry.
    2.2.5 Temperature-Based Sensor A direct proportional operation between the device
    output and Celsius temperature is governed by LM35 precision integrated-circuit
    temperature sensors. The major disadvantage of Kelvin-based temperature sensor
    is that it cannot subtract a large constant voltage from its output to obtain
    scaling in centigrade. No need of providing any external calibration or trimming
    to support typical accuracies of ±1/4 °C at room temperature and ±3/4 °C over
    a full temperature range. 2.3 Irrigation Control Station Irrigation control station
    consists of a wireless communication module, driver circuit, valves, and AC motor.
    Functioning of motors and valves is controlled via input signaling conditions
    (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Block diagram of irrigation control station [12] Full size image
    2.3.1 Driver Circuit This circuit provides major prevention for microcontrollers
    from high surge current and voltage by providing isolation between them. Motor
    control board being a single-layer board is used for the routing on the bottom
    layer. With a threshold range of AC current to 2 A and for remaining tracks a
    maximum of 25 mA, there is successful application in both signal and power nets.
    Keeping the current rating in loop, the output nets of AC signal are with 150
    mil track. 2.4 Base Station Command to generate control signals given from the
    decision-making algorithm and analysis of whole network is done through the base
    station. Storage of sensor data from in-field sensing nodes and provision of inter-connectivity
    are given by a PC-interface (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Block diagram of base station [13]
    Full size image 2.5 Graphical User Interface (Gui) In contrast with the text-based
    interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation, the GUI offers graphical
    icons and visual indicators to represent the information and actions defined by
    the user. Direct manipulation of graphical elements is the driving force to describe
    anything an application displays to the user. It is the primary way you interact
    with the hardware and allows it to interact with you. GUI is being implemented
    using Visual Basic6. This module has the following functionality: (1) Node Setting
    (2) Mode Setting (3) Current Status (4) Node and Motor Control. Flexibility of
    changing the threshold values of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture can
    be materialized through node setting. Selection of either manual mode or auto-mode
    is done through mode setting. The display text boxes show the current status of
    infield sensor nodes (Figs. 6 and 7). Fig. 6 Main graphical user interface (GUI)
    window Full size image Fig. 7 Node setting GUI window Full size image 2.6 Mail
    Transfer Having a graphical user interface, mail transfer makes a connection with
    the local SMTP server with logical addressing mode. This checks the availability
    of port number 25 connected to SMTP server. Execution is done through mail-id
    communication (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 E. Mail transfer GUI window Full size image 2.6.1
    Data Acquisition In order to get the computer data processed in an easy way, data
    acquisition samples the real-world physical conditions and conversions into digital
    numeric values which are used. It typically involves the conversion of analog
    waveforms into digital values for processing. In this project data from in-field
    sensing station is stored in two different files. This finds applications in software
    programs developed using various general-purpose programming languages. Data acquisition
    is implemented with Visual Basic Language. 3 Application and Observations This
    project includes two in-field sensing stations, one base station and one control
    station. Action of base station is to sense and generate control signals for motor
    and valves. Incorporation of the ability to set different threshold values is
    possible through signaling via computer. Functioning of data logging and mailing
    section have been checked using 5–6 email-ids. 4 Limitation Operation of ZigBee
    module is limited to 10–12 m range which is comparatively less for an irrigation
    system. Usage of excess current causes a reduction in battery life and needs more
    batteries. Manual mode of mailing is operational instead of automatic. A simple
    comparator circuit is used instead of a soil moisture sensor. This circuit comprises
    only two states, thus we cannot find out water level present in the soil. 5 Conclusion
    and Future Work A wireless irrigation system comprising ZigBee technology is helpful
    in building low-power and low-cost wireless irrigation system. The main force
    driving this phenomenon is the requirement of low power consumption. The interface
    provides large operations to user to set the conditions according to his/her requirement.
    A thorough checkup starting from circuit level to system design is done and it
    can accessible through the internet. Mails are periodically updated with the stipulated
    data. Certain discrepancies are still not resolved. However, appropriate actions
    have been planned and charted to ease out the operations. Mail transfer can be
    automatically operated with certain algorithm. These in-field sensing stations
    are powered by an external battery which can be converted into solar-powered wireless
    in-field sensing station. This can be implemented through better energy management
    in wireless station. References https://www.radio-electronics.com/info/wireless/zigbee/zigbee.php

    Figures Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract In recent decades, considerable
    efforts have been devoted to process automation in agriculture. Regarding irrigation
    systems, this demand has found several difficulties, including the lack of communication
    networks and the large distances to electricity supply points. With the recent
    implementation of LPWAN wireless communication networks (SIGFOX, LoraWan, and
    NBIoT), and the expanding market of electronic controllers based on free software
    and hardware (i.e., Arduino, Raspberry, ESP, etc.) with low energy requirements,
    new perspectives have appeared for the automation of agricultural irrigation networks.
    This paper presents a low-cost solution for automatic cloud-based irrigation.
    In this paper, it is proposed the design of a node network based on microcontroller
    ESP32-Lora and Internet connection through SIGFOX network. The results obtained
    show the stability and robustness of the designed system. Keywords: LPWAN; free
    hardware; sensor networks; IOT platform 1. Introduction and Background In modern
    farms, the competitiveness of the sector and the growing demand for food [1] leads
    to an increase in water consumption, which requires optimal water management strategies
    ([2,3]). The optimization of irrigation water consumption entails the improvement
    of crop development conditions through irrigation planning: water quantity and
    scheduling. For this purpose, automatic systems for monitoring variables and taking
    decisions are required. 1.1. State of the Art The need for optimization in agriculture
    became a reality in the 1970s. At the beginning, non-standardized wired electronic
    solutions designed ex professo were used. Since then, the development of irrigation
    system optimization has been closely linked to the rise and evolution of ICT [4].
    There has been a trend in the last decade to implement intelligent irrigation
    management systems based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [5], which have also
    been used in other agriculture areas. The characteristics and potentialities of
    WSNs perfectly match irrigation needs [6]. Presently, the integration of the devices
    to local communication networks, as well as to storing platforms, big data and
    information processing in the cloud, enable them to interact with other networks
    and the environment. [7,8] propose applications of IoT and Cloud Computing in
    agriculture Among the advantages of WSNs, we can highlight the option of automating
    irrigation, since networks allow taking measurements (humidity, temperature, irradiance,
    etc.) and actions (solenoid valves, pumps) through the different independent electronic
    systems (nodes) that compose these networks. Several authors [5,9,10] have developed
    methodologies for the analysis and development of efficient networks based on
    needs assessment for different crops, soil attributes, climate, etc. In [11] the
    authors developed an application for smartphones to programme urban lawn irrigation
    by using evapotranspiration data from weather stations. This proposal achieved
    a saving of 48% of water in comparison to the previous irrigation system. In [12]
    the authors monitored golf courses and greenhouses by running an Android management
    application using WSN. This kind of tools allows instant decision making for any
    event and from any place. The integration of WSN and decision-making systems enables
    the development of irrigation plans based on energy savings, available water or
    the reduction of greenhouse gases. In [13] the authors developed an application
    whose aim is to save costs in pumping stations by finding balances between the
    flow (the result of valve opening levels) and the pressure at different points
    of the system. For this purpose, the authors implemented contrasted heuristic
    models ([14,15,16]). In [17], a system aimed at saving energy in irrigation facilities
    by making real-time decisions based on data acquisition was designed through WSN.
    A fuzzy control to optimize WSN energy consumption by establishing when to transmit
    the data collected [18]. In [19], the authors designed a multi-objective optimization
    algorithm to maximize benefits in every irrigation plot while reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions. With the same purpose, we can find works such as that of [20] which
    are oriented towards the search for pumping and monitoring systems that are totally
    disconnected from the electricity grid system. This is achieved by means of a
    real time model that synchronizes the photovoltaic energy available with the requirements
    for each sector. Thanks to the automatic storage and the analysis of the measured
    data, in [21] the authors proposed the elaboration of databases from sensor measurements
    allowing the user of the application to model the operation of the irrigation
    system. The deployment of these solutions based on real-time data availability
    requires wireless communication networks both at local level and to the cloud.
    Networks of distributed nodes in fields and farms require specific attention since
    the quality of transmissions among devices needs to be ensured. The vegetative
    state of the crop canopy or the shape of the soil are known to affect the information
    loss rates in radio wave transmissions. In this sense, the works developed in
    ([22,23]) must be highlighted. 1.2. Typology of Communication Networks Communications
    networks are classified into three different groups according to their range and
    transmission speed as shown in Figure 1 ([24,25]), namely: Figure 1. Data rate
    vs. range in communication networks. Source: [27]. Short-range networks. Cellular
    networks. Long-range networks. Short-range networks do not require a license for
    use. This group includes ZigBee or Bluetooth, among others. They are characterized
    by their low power consumption and high data exchange speed, although these features
    are limited to a short range (Table 1). In [21] the authors used this sort of
    networks for monitoring the irrigation infrastructure. Table 1. Local network
    communication technology characteristics. Cellular networks outstand for a high
    transmission speed including short (Wi-Fi) and long-range with license (GSM, GPRS,
    3G, 4G, 5G). In [26] a tracking system for sprayers in vineyards based on GSM
    and GPRS high data flow was developed. Long-range networks present as advantages
    to the previous two systems that they have lower energy consumption, lower cost
    and a greater range. A new model of long-range wireless networks, Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWANs), has been recently developed. Its main feature is to have
    a star topology which has led to two models of technological development [28].
    On the one hand, several telecommunications companies have used existing facilities
    (antennas, relay stations, etc.) to offer coverage to devices compatible with
    this technology [29]. On the other, collaborative networks have emerged for the
    global integration of IoT applications through low-cost open tools [30]. This
    “ease of use” increases since electronics companies, aware of the impulse of LPWANs,
    have incorporated compatible communication modules to the already known boards,
    thus facilitating connectivity (e.g., Arduino MKR 1200, Arduino MKR 1300, Pycom
    Lopy 4, etc.). LPWANs are very promising for the development of a monitoring,
    control and computing solution “in the cloud” in agriculture. Relevant variables
    are well known and, in most cases, have reaction times that limit the measurement
    frequency required (temperature, soil humidity, atmospheric humidity, precipitation,
    solar radiation, wind, hail). For this reason, the information transfer rate is
    low, and long-range communications are required [31]. The main aspects of SIGFOX,
    LoraWan and NBIoT are presented below considering their applicability in the digitalization
    of irrigation exploitations SIGFOX: It is presented as the most limited option
    in terms of transmission speed (100 bps) and asymmetry, as it allows 140 uplink
    and 4 downlink messages per day. The uploading of messages admits up to 12 bytes
    for payload and up to 8 bytes for download. Moreover, the network use involves
    a cost per device similar to the use of the GPRS network in M2M (Machine to Machine)
    mode. Despite these limitations, SIGFOX is considered to be a suitable option
    for a wide range of agricultural projects since no additional facilities are required
    to be deployed and it achieves a high coverage in many EU countries (Figure 2).
    Several devices incorporating the SIGFOX communication module have emerged on
    the market due to the rapid growth of this technology. Figure 2. SIGFOX coverage.
    Reference: [29]. LoraWan: this option has significant advantages in terms of operating
    costs, no costs associated with the use of radio space, and symmetry in communication
    [32]. While there is a 1%-time limitation on band occupancy, the transfer rate
    required in the applications analysed is not a constraint. The number of messages
    in both directions is a favourable aspect. The Things Network (TTN) platform that
    channels information from any LoraWan node has allowed an expansion of this type
    of network [30]. As an example, Figure 3 shows the current status of gateway deployment
    assigned to TTN in Spain. Figure 3. Gateways assigned to TTN in Spain. Source:
    [30]. Considering that the areas covered by the gateways are, on average, circles
    with a radius of 20 km, the availability of the network in agricultural areas
    is still very low. The growth in coverage is the result of ad hoc gateways implemented
    by users of the network. NBIOT: This technology employs restricted frequencies
    which require a license for use. Its deployment is being carried out by the main
    telephone operators of each country (Vodafone, T-Mobile, AT&T, etc.). NBIOT provides
    a higher transmission speed than the other LPWAN options, although it involves
    a service cost per use and the range is reduced. Moreover, the availability of
    devices is still limited. Figure 4 presents a qualitative comparison of the three
    standards analysed above. Figure 4. Qualitative comparison between SIGFOX, LORAWAN
    and NBIoT (Source: Own elaboration). Free hardware philosophy has been used in
    LPWAN network applications ([33,34]), and more specifically ATMEL microcontrollers
    compatible with its development environment (IDE) [35]. Its widespread popularity
    has allowed the development of boards adapted to Bluetooth communications, Wi-Fi,
    Ethernet, LoRa, LORAWAN, SIGFOX, or Android, as well as a catalogue of sensors
    to interact with and measure any variable. These features, together with its low
    cost and size, have led to its gradual integration in the field of WSNs ([36,37]).
    1.3. IoT Platforms The literature shows three possibilities to approach the implementation
    of monitoring and performance based on IoT and Cloud Computing. Firstly, specific
    programming models can be referred for specific problems, as the ones used for
    precision agriculture management [7] or for the control of irrigation valves [38].
    This method entails a high programming effort, as it requires the coding of the
    entire application without reuse of code or adaptation to standard software. Secondly,
    we find commercial solutions adapted to the client’s needs in terms of data measuring
    and uploading to the cloud ([39,40]). As a drawback, these solutions are closed
    to the user. Finally, another way to address these technological challenges is
    to work with generic commercial tools (IoT platforms) where developers adapt the
    application to their specific needs. The report presents the most representative
    IoT platforms and their distribution in the market (Figure 5). Figure 5. Top IoT
    platforms. Source: [41]. This paper presents a new system for monitoring and acting
    on interesting variables in irrigation management. Economic competitiveness, standardization,
    and the use of flexible platforms are the key considerations for this design,
    which is based on the use of WSN and LPWAN communications, as well as on IoT platform
    integration. The solution presented here uses LoRa communications at the local
    level, and SIGFOX communications to access IoT platforms. At the hardware level,
    free hardware boards compatible with Arduino IDE have been used. The structure
    of the article is as follows. Section 2 describes the choice of the control board,
    the communication system and the monitoring platform, as well as their development
    and programming. Section 3 details the implementation of the proposed system and
    the results obtained. Finally, Section 4 presents the conclusions of this work
    and the further lines of research to be developed. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
    Configuration of the Local System 2.1.1. Local Network Architecture of the Agricultural
    Farm When approaching the system architecture at a local level, we find two alternative
    topologies: 1- Direct access from each node to the cloud: Each node accesses the
    cloud directly through the available network (Figure 6a). It must be equipped
    with the communication module that supports the working network (SIGFOX, LORAWAN,
    etc.). This method does not include communication between nodes, but only vertical
    communication to the cloud - therefore, it is not necessary to develop any type
    if infrastructure. When opting for a network that requires pay-per-use in applications
    with a high number of nodes, this may represent a considerable operating cost.
    Figure 6. Local architecture configurations. Source: Own elaboration. 2- Access
    to a local concentrator: A star, tree or mesh local network links to the Internet
    through a local gateway equipped with a module compatible with the working network
    (Figure 6b). This solution is conditioned by the distance between nodes and data
    traffic requirements. The most suitable wireless communication technologies for
    local network are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee and Lora [9]. Table 1 shows the main
    characteristics of each technology. The topology represented in Figure 6b has
    been considered for the solution presented here. As a result, only a single device
    connected to the cloud is required, thus reducing the cost of acquiring and operating
    modules. A solution is proposed based on sensor nodes distributed over the irrigation
    surface with a concentrator or gateway next to the pumping station, as shown in
    Figure 7. Figure 7. Proposal for node distribution and local gateway distribution.
    Source: Own elaboration. For the selected topology, there are several communication
    alternatives available as described in Table 1. LoRa has been selected for this
    proposal as it provides much greater ranges than the other options. Thus, the
    result of communication consists of a LoRa network for the local level. Figure
    7 shows the local nodes (hydrants and monitors) connected by LoRa technology to
    a gateway, consisting of a LoRa module. The connection to the cloud is detailed
    in Section 2.1.5. Since the longest distance between nodes in the working farm
    is 900 m (Figure 8), the proposed solution is adequate in according to features
    shown Table 1 (transmission range, [42]. Figure 8. Farm irrigation and node distribution
    layout. 2.1.2. LoRa Hardware Platform for Local Network Table 2 shows the characteristics
    for currently available electronic boards incorporating LoRa. Table 2. Technical
    characteristics of LoRa integrated boards. The HELTEC WiFi LoRa 32 board (Figure
    9) is recommended for this work because its performance is adequate and the price
    is the lowest of all options—a relevant consideration when the number of measuring
    points is large. Moreover, this board incorporates a 0.96-inch OLED display, where
    messages established via software can be visualized. Figure 9. Heltec WiFi LoRa
    32. The fieldwork design of the LoRa network for this paper has been developed
    by experimentally testing the signal level in both the receiver and the transmitter
    (no package loss). It has not been considered the potential interference between
    the foliar mass growth of the olive tree and the quality parameters of the radio
    information transmission [22] since the olive tree is a low-density canopy species.
    For all nodes 1.2 m height antennas are available (3m height for gateway antenna).
    Olive trees in orchard frames are isolated (Figure 8 and Figure 10). This feature
    together with the low leaf density enables successful communications between nodes.
    The antenna used is stubby type, quad band. Its features are: Length: 58 mm; Impedance:
    50 Ω; Gain: 2 dBi (3.5 dBi peak); VSWR: 2 maximum; Polarisation: Vertical; Connector:
    SMA Male; Directivity: Omnidirectional. Figure 10. Field monitor node. 2.1.3.
    Sensors There are sensors to measure the whole range of relevant irrigation variables:
    hydraulic network (pressures and flows), environmental variables (i.e., air temperature
    and humidity, irradiance, wind speed, precipitation), and soil variables (i.e.,
    humidity, temperature, pH, matric potential). In this work, irrigation management
    has been approached exclusively from soil moisture, but there are other criteria
    to control irrigation. In this case, a sensor is required to provide soil moisture,
    and its supply voltage and measurement signal must be compatible with HELTEC Wi-Fi
    LoRa 32 board. Under these conditions, SHT 15 (manufactured by Sensirion) sensor
    has been chosen. It is encapsulated in a sintered metal enclosure protecting electronics
    from direct contact with water (see Figure 11). Figure 11. SHT15 sensor. The power
    supply, 3.3 V, can be obtained from the electronic board. Sensor consumption is
    0.9 mA. The accuracy offered is +−2% in the range of 10–90 % relative humidity,
    and +−4% out of this range. 2.1.4. Power Supply for HELTEC Wi-Fi LoRa 32 Board
    Power supply is an important issue in the agriculture, since its availability
    is not frequent in locations to be sensed. It is essential to know the energy
    demands to address the problem of power supply. This requirement considers three
    states of the board: running, transmitting and deep sleep. In running mode, the
    microprocessor reads the sensor value. In transmitting mode, data are sent to
    the concentrator or gateway. Once this process has been completed, it switches
    to a low-power mode until the next measurement is taken. This mode involves the
    deactivation, via software, of all the elements comprising the microcontroller,
    with the exception of the main timer. In this mode, the CPU and the LoRa and Wi-Fi
    radio modules are disconnected. The board was monitored by executing the work
    cycle above using a YOKOGAWA DL850E oscilloscope, obtaining the results shown
    in Figure 12. The most significant values are Ir, Ita, Idp and tt (shown in Table
    3), where: Figure 12. Electric current consumed by HELTEC Wi-Fi LoRa 32 in its
    three function modes. Table 3. Electric parameters for running, transmitting and
    deep sleep modes. Ir = Running mode current (mA) Ita = Transmitting mode average
    current (mA) Ids = Deep sleep mode current (mA) tt = Transmitting time (s) The
    time that the system remains in deep sleep mode is given by the frequency of the
    measurements to be made. A second delay is applied to stabilize sensor measurements
    when the deep sleep mode ends. Table 4 shows, for different measurement frequencies,
    the required load values per working day. Table 4. Daily energy consumption according
    to measurement frequency for each function mode. From data shown in Table 4, the
    influence of daily consumption measurement frequency is practically insignificant,
    with the highest consumption during deep sleep periods. If power is supplied by
    means of lithium ion cells type 18,650, with a unit capacity of 3.000 mAh, in
    the case of using a single cell, the charge duration would be just over ten days.
    Even with several cells in parallel, duration would not be enough for an autonomous
    operation application. Based on these data, two alternatives are considered: (1)
    energy generation system based on a photovoltaic cell for battery recharging,
    (2) replacement of deep sleep mode by disconnection, via hardware, of the entire
    equipment. The first option, based on energy generation by photovoltaic cell,
    will require one or more 1 W-peak power photovoltaic modules with a 6 V open-circuit
    voltage of and 200 mA short-circuit current. To design the number of modules and
    cells, the method proposed by Posadillo and López Luque [43] using the LLP (Loss
    of Load Probability) concept is applied. A 0° angle module inclination has been
    assumed as the most disadvantageous option. The results obtained are shown in
    Table 5. Table 5. LLP values for different configurations. The most suitable option
    (with the lowest probability of failure) is that with two cells in parallel and
    one module due to set compactness. The TPL5110 module, a low-power timer, is proposed
    for the second option, based on replacing deep sleep mode with hardware disconnection,
    which interrupts power supply for a period of time from 100 ms to 7200 s. During
    interruption time, consumption is reduced to 25 µA. Table 6 shows consumption
    under different scenarios. Table 6. Daily energy consumption according to measurement
    frequency for each function mode. According to Table 6, when supplying the system
    with two lithium ion cells with a nominal capacity of 3000 mAh, the battery life
    would be over 6 years in the most unfavorable case (15-min sending frequency).
    2.1.5. Local Gateway Table 7 specifies the technological characteristics for SIGFOX
    boards (microcontroller and module). These boards are flexible and have numerous
    analogue and digital inputs and outputs. Table 7. Technical characteristics for
    SIGFOX integrated boards. The Arduino MKR1200 module has been selected in this
    work because it is programmed in a well-known environment (Arduino IDE) and used
    by a wide community of developers that freely share libraries and resources for
    programming. Power supply for this board is not considered here because it is
    located in the pumping station of the farm, where electrical network is available.
    A wired serial communication is set between the Heltec ESP32 LoRa board, operating
    as a hub for the set of nodes distributed in the farm, and the module MKR1200,
    which acts as a local gateway. The module MKR1200 communicates to the cloud through
    SIGFOX. 2.2. Exchanging Information with the Cloud Concerning the communications
    required for irrigation management, the main aspects are: coverage, scope, cost
    and energy consumption of electronics. Figure 4 shows how SIGFOX improves LORAWAN
    and NBIoT features. SIGFOX uses Ultra Narrow Band communications encoded by DBPSK
    (Differential Binary Phase Shift-Keying) and optimized for the exchange of short
    messages. The protocol accepts messages up to 38 bytes for a 12-byte payload.
    Figure 13 shows the upload message structure. Figure 13. Upload message structure
    in SIGFOX. The limitation of the payload to 12 bytes for uplink messages and 8
    bytes for downlink messages raises the need to design a strategy for sending and
    receiving information. The number of daily upload messages is limited to 140,
    and the number of daily download messages is limited to 4. Figure 14 shows the
    download message structure. Figure 14. Download message structure in SIGFOX. Soil
    moisture is a value varying between 0 and 100, so it can be represented by a 7-bit
    binary number (0…127). Thus, it is possible to include 13 values in each transmission.
    The remaining 5 bits are used to identify the group of nodes corresponding to
    the frame. If the number of nodes of the system is less than 14, humidity values
    can be updated every 15 min. For a higher number of nodes, there are two possibilities,
    either to update with a frequency of 30 min (14 to 27 nodes) or higher, or to
    have more than one local gateway. The four download messages are used to establish
    an irrigation priority between the nodes and the application time. The operating
    time can vary from 0 to 2048. This time applies equally to all nodes, acting on
    those selected valves by assigning “1” to the corresponding bit. The information
    sent by the MKR1200 module reaches the backend, a SIGFOX web application where
    users can visualize the data in a hexadecimal format list. The information must
    be sent in real time from the backend to a platform with a user interface for
    data consultation and processing, as well as for implementing decision-making
    processes when necessary. The method of transmitting information from the SIGFOX
    backend is called callback. Figure 15 shows SIGFOX communication architecture.
    Figure 15. SIGFOX network topology. The callback can be routed to its own server
    or to an IoT platform. Thingspeak, an IoT platform, has been chosen in this paper
    considering its low infrastructure requirements. Data can be graphically displayed
    in the web application or in any mobile device [44]. In addition to recording
    and displaying information, this platform provides the mathematical analysis tool
    MATLAB®, enabling the user to perform all kinds of information processing, including
    generating actions based on the results, implementing analysis and decision-making
    programs. 3. Results The main result of this research is the design and implementation
    of a comprehensive monitoring and a high performance system based on communication
    with the cloud for irrigation systems. Figure 16 shows the architecture of the
    solution. Figure 16. Global system architecture. The elements that compose the
    system are: Monitor node: This is a device consisting of a Heltec ESP32 LoRa board
    measuring soil moisture through a SHT15 sensor. As shown in Figure 17, the board
    is powered from the TLP5110 module and the battery pack. To ensure the durability
    of the electronic devices, the unit has been placed in a PVC box with IP67 protection.
    The node measures soil moisture every 15 min and sends the data via LoRa network
    to the local gateway. Once the operation has been performed, a digital output
    is activated to order the TPL5110 module to disconnect the power supply until
    the next transmission. Hydrant node: Designed similarly to the previous node at
    a hardware level, although it is not equipped with a humidity sensor. To act on
    the hydrant valve, digital output from the Heltec ESP32 LoRa board is used. It
    connects to the gateway every 15 min to request priority and time settings. Gateway
    or local concentrator: It consists of two devices, a Heltec ESP32 LoRa board and
    an MKR1200 board. The first one operates as a LoRa communications concentrator.
    Through this element communication is directed to hydrant nodes and from monitor
    nodes. This board communicates through the serial port with the MKR1200 board,
    which is the platform that communicates to the cloud. SIGFOX backend: The information
    sent by the local gateway reaches the SIGFOX web platform where data are sent
    to the IoT platform. This process is bidirectional, the backend receives data
    from the IoT platform to be sent to the MKR1200 board. Figure 18 shows data in
    the backend. IoT platform: ThingSpeak receives information from field sensors
    and records it in its own database. At the same time, an application developed
    in MATLAB® analyses moisture data, and generates priority and run time settings
    for each hydrant node. Figure 17. Monitor Node. Figure 18. Messages sent in SIGFOX
    backend. Source: [29]. A practical application of the system proposed here has
    been implemented in an olive orchard located in Córdoba (Spain). Figure 19 shows
    the location of the farm. It is a 37.66 ha of olive tree farm (Olea europea, L.)
    in an 8 m × 8 m frame. The farm has drip irrigation (1 dripper/1.5 m). The trees
    are adult (45 years old). A 56,500 m3 reservoir, whose supply comes from a connection
    to the community of irrigators Genil-Cabra, pressurizes the farm by means of a
    50 HP pumping station. Figure 8 shows how water is distributed through a branched
    network of polyethylene pipes to 3 sectors. Figure 19. Farm location. In October
    2018, monitoring and control systems for three irrigation sectors were installed.
    Figure 8 also shows the layout of hydrant nodes, monitor and gateway. Figure 9
    shows the layout of a monitor node in the field, while Figure 20 shows stored
    humidity data on the ThingSpeak platform. No transmission faults were detected
    during the test period. Figure 20. Monitored data at Thingspeak application. Table
    8 shows the cost of the total equipment. Table 8. Total equipment costs. Moreover,
    the annual operating cost of SIGFOX network is 16.53 €/gateway. The use of the
    ThingSpeak platform implies a cost of 600 €/year (Standard license) for a limit
    of 33 M data. Since a monitor node downloads 35,040 data/year, the Standard license
    would support a maximum of 900 nodes. 4. Conclusions An IoT solution has been
    proved to be a solution to control and manage irrigation. This is a geographically
    scalable solution applicable to other areas of agriculture. Problems related to
    connectivity and energy availability have usually made automation difficult in
    rural areas. The emergence of SIGFOX technology with its low implementation and
    operating costs allows isolated devices to be connected to the cloud. Furthermore,
    a strategy focused on reducing electronics energy consumption has enabled the
    nodes to have a power independence for over 5 years. ICT based on free hardware
    and software have led to a high reliability and low-cost solution either in terms
    of investment or operation. The solution has been tested in real conditions for
    four months. Robustness and stability of the communications and hardware with
    been verified. The IoT platform used in this work (ThingSpeak) has allowed interaction
    with controlled facilities from any device connected to the Internet. The prolonged
    operation of systems such as the proposed here will generate a large volume of
    data from which knowledge will be extracted, as well as new irrigation strategies
    can also be developed. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.L.-L.; Investigation,

    IEEE Conference Location: Shanghai, China SECTION I. Introduction The fourth industrial
    revolution, known as Industry 4.0, entails a capillary digital ecosystem embracing
    each single component of the factory from the field to the supervision (and beyond)levels
    [1]. The IoT is a key enabling technology for the Industry 4.0, because it can
    inherently provide communication capabilities to any device within a plant of
    interest [2]. Those devices can create a pervasive and networked environment,
    usually referred to as Cyber-Physical System (CPS), that can provide unforeseen
    services in most of the verticals known so far. Smart agriculture is a promising
    field of application of Industry 4.0 concepts [3]. In fact, the integration of
    CPS, IoT, and cloud/edge/fog computing technologies with agricultural machineries
    can foster the set up of precision agriculture systems, automated irrigation planning
    tools, optimization of plant growth process, monitoring of agricultural land,
    and management of production, which bring significant advantages with respect
    to classic crop management [4]. Potential IoT applications in Smart Agriculture
    cover a wide range of scenarios: greenhouse management through sensors, energy
    efficiency enhancement, observation of phenological phases, detection of insects
    or crop diseases, and also production chain traceability [5]. Despite the clear
    advantages that IoT brings to these environments, setting up only Decision Support
    Tools (DST)softwares is a rather limited approach to the perspectives of fully
    automation that these technologies would allow. DSTs aid in decision making by
    offering useful insights into easily consumable bites, but it is still difficult
    to analyze intangible or indefinable data and although these softwares have become
    much simpler over the years, many farmers still find it difficult to use [6].
    In order to bridge this gap, a fully automated fertilization system (namely Solarfertigation)is
    proposed hereby, along-with a thorough description of its architecture, components,
    and real use cases from the field. Solarfertigation is designed to integrate the
    decision-making process and both the fertilization and irrigation automation.
    This system is designed to be energy self-sufficient thanks to the embedded Photovoltaic
    (PV)plant. Solarfertigation unit is designed not only to provide IoT network gateway
    functionalities, but to combine all the hardware and software components needed
    to run electrical actuations, software-services and proper network connections.
    With reference to the IoT network, open standard short-range telecommunications
    technologies for added value IoT services have been implemented. In particular,
    the network is based on low power protocol architecture, able to support also
    critical applications that need deterministic (or almost deterministic)service
    provisioning. These activities are grounded in the 802.15.4 protocol stack. A
    prototype version of Solarfertigation has been also implemented and tested on
    the field: its logical and physical setup will be presented hereby along with
    a comprehensive picture of the proposed system architecture. The remainder of
    this work is organized as follows: section II provides a detailed description
    of the system architecture. Section II proposes a thorough characterization of
    both hardware and software components, with a focus on logical connections and
    real use cases. The main achievements and future work perspectives are highlighted
    in section V. SECTION II. System Overview A. Fertilization Machine Solarfertigation
    system is a combination of a fertilizer machine, PV plant and automation devices
    and software. Fertilization and irrigation subsystem is composed by the components
    used to manage fertilizer solution and the hydraulic parts made up of pipes, pump,
    solenoid valves, manifolds, taps and other accessories, to distribute the solution
    in the field. PV System is made up of several panels positioned on an appropriate
    support structure, batteries, and an inverter. The system can use both solid and
    liquid fertilizers. They are dosed respectively through cochlea and volumetric
    pump into a tank, where the solution is prepared. The machine is capable of changing
    the type and quantity of fertilizers in solution. For each irrigation cycle, the
    system can simultaneously manage multiple crops even with different growth phases
    in the same crop cycle. It also aims to detect the main environmental parameters
    defining the optimal amount of water and fertilizer to be used. Thus, it contributes
    significantly, to increased productivity of the land and electricity, water and
    fertilizers saving. B. IoT Architecture The chosen communication architecture
    (shown in Figure 1)is grounded on a static multihop IoT network that senses the
    environment and reports collected data to the cloud. The IoT network is composed
    by several nodes and a gateway. IoT devices measure soil moisture whereas the
    gateway gather the reading of devices and measures (on its own)ambient temperature
    and humidity. The gateway is a central control unit for the system, communicating
    with cloud platform in order to receive commands, store data and interact with
    User Interface (UI). Raspberry Pi single-board computer has been chosen to integrate
    gateway functionalities and software services. The hardware specification of this
    platform will be provided in following sections. Amazon Web Services (AWS)[7]
    is the cloud platform provider for the system. This technology allows to have
    a virtual computer cluster available on the Internet. In the proposed use case,
    AWS provides an ActiveMQ message-oriented middleware for Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT)broker services. System central unit design and hardware foresee
    that it not only acts as an IoT network gateway but integrates all the hardware
    and software components able to run electrical actuations, software micro-services
    for event management, cloud connection, and database integration. We adopted Institute
    of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)802.15.4, a standard for wireless
    communication issued by the IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers).
    This protocol stack provides a low data rate solution with multi-month to multi-year
    battery life and very low complexity, operating in an unlicensed, international
    frequency band [8]. This standard allows for communication in a point-to-point
    or a point-to-multipoint configuration. A typical application involves a central
    coordinator with multiple remote nodes connecting back to this central host. IEEE
    802.15.4 Physical Layer (PHY)manages the signal transmission over the physical
    medium [9]. Offset-Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (O-QPSK)modulation with a 2 Mbps
    physical data rate [8] is used and works in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific
    and Medical (ISM)band, in the range between 2.405 and 2.48 GHz. At Medium Access
    Control (MAC)layer, the IEEE 802.15.4 [10] features Time Slotted Channel Hopping
    (TSCH)[11] [12], which is characterized by two peculiarities: (i)time division
    into slots, and (ii)frequency (or channel)hopping. At the Adaptation Layer, two
    solutions are proposed: (i)6tisch Operation Sublayer (6top), also known as IPv6
    over networks of resource-constrained nodes (6lo)[13], and (ii)IPv6 over Low power
    Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN)[14]. 6top provides link states, TSCH
    configuration, control procedures and scheduling policies. 6LoWPAN is the name
    of a working group having as an objective the adaptation of IPv6 on IEEE 802.15.4-based
    networks [15] [17]. At network layer, the IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e
    (6TiSCH)protocol stack features Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy networks
    (RPL)[18] [19] as routing protocol for 6LoWPAN networks, supporting multipoint-to-point,
    point-to-multipoint or point-to-point traffic. MQTT is used as application layer
    protocol. This publish-subscribe protocol is suitable for low-bandwidth and constrained
    devices interconnection. Fig. 1: IoT architecture Show All SECTION III. System
    Components A. Hardware This section provides an overview of the hardware needed
    for both IoT devices and central unit. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+1 has been chosen
    as central unit. This small single-board computer (Figure 2(a))is the latest product
    in the Raspberry Pi 3 range, boasting a 64-bit quad core processor running at
    1.4GHz, dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.2/Bluetooth Low Energy
    (BLE), faster Ethernet and dual-band wireless LAN. Raspberry Pi provides a powerful
    feature for CPS interfacing: 40-pin General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)pins. Any
    of the GPIO pins can be designated (in software)as an input or output pin and
    used for a wide range of purposes. The GPIO pins can be used with a variety of
    alternative functions, some are available on all pins, others on specific pins.
    In order to provide a simple weather station it has been integrated a DHT22 temperature-humidity
    sensor2. Fig. 2: Hardware equipment Show All The gateway also interacts with two
    external components: Analog-to-digital Converter (ADC); relay board. The first
    is the Adafruit MCP30083 used for retrieving data like battery status and water
    level into the main tank, providing thus useful information to manage critical
    events such as low battery level and lack of water in the tank. The relay board
    is a LOW Level 5V 8-channel relay interface board4 directly connected to the GPIO
    interface of raspberry pi, and powers on and off the specific output (water pumps,
    recycling motor and fertilizer mixers)which have separate power supply. The components
    involved for each sensor node of the IoT are: XBee-PRO S2C RF module5 DF Robot
    capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor6 Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)Battery PV panel Leaving
    out of the scope power supply and recharge circuit, the Radio Frequency (RF)modules
    provided in this setup are the Digi International XBee ®S2C 802.15.4 RF Modules
    (Figure 2(b)). It can provide quick, robust communication in point-to-point, peer-to-peer,
    and multipoint/star configurations7. B. Software We based the software development
    on microservice architectural style instead of a monolithic structure. A monolithic
    application is structured with a single large code-base/repository that offer
    tens or hundreds of services using different interfaces such as HTML pages, Web
    services or/and REST services [20]. As can be seen in Figure 3, microservices
    architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services,
    enabling continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. Fig. 3:
    Microservices and monolithic architectures Show All Scripts running on Raspberry
    pi driving CPS compose system backend and are developed using Node.js, an open-source,
    cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.
    Frontend is deployed under Heroku Platform as a service (PaaS)provider and uses
    as data storage MongoDB, a document oriented database with JSON as data document
    format. This document store, is a computer program designed for storing, retrieving
    and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data
    [21]. The server side environment of the UI service is developed using Express
    and NodeJS. Adopted programming language for this service is Typescript, an open-source
    programming language defined as a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript (Figure
    4). C. Connections Solarfertigation current release provides the following features:
    field data gathering, storage and visualization; real-time remote activation of
    irrigation and fertilization machines; date-based event scheduling; weather station.
    Fig. 4: Javascript layers Show All Every content is delivered to UI (Figure 6)using
    MQTT protocol [22] and ActiveMQ [23] message broker deployed on AWS as Software
    as a service (SaaS)(Figure 5). Fig. 5: MQTT connections Show All MQTT is a publish/subscribe,
    extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained
    devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks [24]. The design
    principles are to minimize network bandwidth and device resource requirements
    whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery.
    Apache ActiveMQ is an open source message broker written in Java together with
    a full Java Message Service (JMS)client. It provides “Enterprise Features” which
    in this case means fostering the communication from more than one client or server.
    Supported clients include Java via JMS 1.1 as well as several other “cross language”
    clients. MQTT with TLS client authentication broker is hosted on AWS cloud, a
    publish/subscribe broker service that enables the sending and receiving of messages
    to and from AWS IoT. Trough MQTT messaging structure it possible to deal with
    several system management aspects: data collection and storage into MongoDB; local
    database for scheduled events; real-time power-on and off commands. Data provided
    by sensors are collected trough the IoT coordinator, processed by IoT gateway,
    sent to MQTT cloud broker and published into MongoDB. With these data, frontend
    side web and mobile graphical interfaces are built (6). On the other hand, local
    gateway listening to proper topics is able to collect messages containing informations
    about scheduled events, generating thus SQLite local database entries. A separate
    script is used to continuously read from local database changes and drive date-based
    events. Also remote actuation commands for real-time irrigation and fertilization
    devices control are sent via MQTT messages. Fig. 6: Web interface for soil moisture
    section Show All Fig. 7: System architecture Show All The system manages its functionality
    with the logical connections shown in Figure 7. (A)Mqtt broker and central unit
    exchange messages for real-time testing of electrovalves activation and events
    scheduling. MQTT message payload contains JSON data providing proper information
    fields. To prevent unpredictable behavior in case of internet connection failures,
    (B)connection represents the local storage of future events into local SQlite
    database. (C)The central unit continuously monitors events entry changes. Data
    gathered from the field sensors are stored into MongoDB Cloud Database (D). Web
    and mobile interfaces create MQTT messages (i)and read data to be displayed into
    graphs and interfaces from MongoDB online database(ii). SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup A. Field Operation Figure 8 represents the experimental setup installed
    into a small garden. Here central unit and three remote sensor nodes are visible.
    In this setup the sensor nodes are placed at a distance of about 5 meters from
    each other due to spatial limitations. Fig. 8: Experimental setup with three IoT
    nodes Show All As shown in Figure 9(a) the central unit is connected to the irrigation
    system through three outputs for three different field zones as well as the connection
    for water supply. The PV panel continuously charges two 12V batteries that supply
    power both to the irrigation system and to the electronic components. Fig. 9:
    Central unit and IoT network coordinator Show All B. Use Cases Real-time activations
    For real-time testing purpose the systems creates MQTT messages containing information
    about the specific device to activate. The gateway listening to precise topic
    turns these information into electromechanical actuation. Event scheduling and
    management Scheduled events messages provide information about quantity and type
    of fertilizers, irrigation duration and date/time details. Also event deletion,
    modification and logging of completed/aborted events are managed trough MQTT messaging.
    With these informations the electromechanical system is set to first create the
    required fertilizer mixture and then creating the water solution irrigating thus
    the area of interest. Soil and ambient data publishing Data provided by sensors
    are collected by local gateway and published online on MongoDB as JSON objects.
    UI shows graphs and information from MongoDB. In Table I some of the differences
    for use case requirements are listed. Table I: Use cases requirements The Quality
    of Service (QoS)defines the guarantee of delivery for a specific message. There
    are three QoS levels in MQTT: at most once (0), at least once (1), exactly once
    (2). Indeed, for non-critical applications and redundant environmental data collection
    it is not necessary to ensure the highest level of service in MQTT. On one hand,
    building a local database for events storage, ensures the execution of scheduled
    irrigation and fertilization actions with no need of internet connection. On the
    other hand, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide higher performance,
    and their data model befits the data collection use case of the proposed environment.
    SECTION V. Conclusions and Future Work Solarfertigation system is still under
    development and the work will lead to scaling up the system with particular reference
    to the number of IoT nodes, different data sources interplay, integration of weather
    notifications, agronomic model-based algorithms, and machine learning integration.
    The current architecture has already been designed to support a large number of
    IoT nodes. Indeed, IEEE 802.15.4 supports heterogeneous traffic thanks to multi-hop
    routing and different traffic patterns among the IoT nodes. Soil moisture and
    weather data interplay will be evaluated from the agronomic point of view in order
    to improve farming algorithms and crop quality. Although a weather station is
    already operating, a notification system for event management depending on weather
    forecasts is being integrated. Irrigation and fertilization events will be affected
    by environmental parameters following agronomic models for different crops and
    species in terms of nutrients and water needs, and various phenological stages.
    Some early experiments are in progress comparing well known studies such as Penman-Monteith
    [2] and Hargreaves-Samani [25]. The integration of agronomic models for different
    crops and the creation of a database including agronomic information for different
    species (nutrients, water needs, and phenological stages)is under development.
    Thanks to these first additions'' algorithms for fertilization and irrigation
    management following the proposed models will be deployed. As data collection
    increases, it will be taken into account machine learning integration aiming to
    the full automation of farming processes. We will carry on extensive experimental
    tests to validate sensor node and machineries energy consumption as well as a
    comparison about water and fertilizer demand with a standard machine. Container
    images integration will be adopted to enhance portability and sharability of the
    software. About communication technologies some experimentation and performance
    evaluations will be conducted using Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). In particular,
    Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)performance evaluations are already underway and will be
    carried out both in laboratory set-up and on specific test sites. The research
    activity, will then provide a vision of a 5G-IoT technologies application into
    this Smart Agriculture environment (robotics and high bandwidth applications)considering
    a performance evaluation through experimental simulation tests. Then it will investigate
    the integration of the 5G technology within the industrial developed system. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Singapore SECTION I. Introduction Sustaining
    agricultural productivity, guaranteeing food-security, and enhancing economic
    growth in the face of climate variability, diminishing labour force, and changing
    soil conditions requires innovation in agriculture. In India, agriculture contributes
    18% of the country''s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs more than 50% of
    the population [1]. Notwithstanding these contributions, the sector is under stress
    and the recent economic survey of the Indian government has pointed out the need
    to extract “more crop per drop” which indicates exploiting technology and good
    practices to enhance productivity per drop of water. While this is largely dependent
    on the irrigation system, recent developments in technology are being touted as
    solutions [2]. The real-time environmental parameters such as temperature, soil
    moisture, humidity, evapotranspiration, cropping cycles, and others influence
    the crop lifecycle. Resource utilization can be optimized by real-time monitoring
    of these parameters and taking corrective actions based on sensed information.
    In this backdrop, the Internet of Things (IoT) with has emerged as an enabler
    of agriculture automation [3]–[5]. The IoT uses recent advances in sensing, networking,
    and computing technologies to enable novel applications and services. The use
    of IoT for crop monitoring has been studied in [6]–[9]. Fusing crop statistical
    information and agricultural environmental information was studied in [10]. However,
    control functionalities were not studied in these investigation. The investigations
    in [11] and [12] proposed a framework with limited control functions. The role
    of IoT for controlling the water consumption in irrigation has been studied by
    many scientists as well. A simple irrigation system was studied in [13]. An advanced
    system was proposed in [14] that aims to transform traditional farming to modern
    one. The investigation in [15] proposed using wireless sensor networks for managing
    irrigation in agricultural farms. The framework proposed allowed user to interact
    with the data and consult in a comfortable way. An IoT based smart farm irrigation
    system was proposed in [16] wherein Zigbee was used for communication between
    sensor nodes and base station. While data was collected and processed in these
    investigation, combining cloud computing with IoT was not fully explored. This
    provides additional opportunities due to the service delivery models of the cloud.
    Recently significant efforts have been devoted to combine IoT and cloud computing
    [17], [19], [20] showed that the IoT benefits can be enhanced by combining it
    with cloud computing. The role of cloud-based IoT scheme for precision agriculture
    was studied in [18]. However, the final control aspect has not been considered.
    Similarly, optimization models for irrigation have been studied in [21] without
    discussions on monitoring and control. A review of the literature reveals that
    existing approaches on using IoT are restricted to monitoring and data-aggregation.
    Final control including optimization of resources has not been studied in the
    literature to our best knowledge. In this paper, we combine the IoT sensing and
    networking capability with cloud interfaces, use the data to study the optimal
    irrigation rates, and finally implement the computed flow rates by commanding
    a solenoid valve. Consequently, a comprehensive solution including sensing, networking,
    control, and optimization is proposed. Such a methodology has not been proposed
    for agricultural irrigation purposes to our best knowledge. The main contributions
    of the paper are: A smart irrigation system that uses IoT and cloud-connectivity
    to aggregate and store information, an optimization model to compute the optimal
    irrigation parameters, and final control implemented using solenoid valves. Design
    aspects of IoT hardware, software, and their integration along with networking
    as well as cloud connectivity are discussed. Demonstrate the control methodology
    and hardware using experiments/simulations. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. Section II presents the system architecture and design which describes
    the various components of the system. The optimization model for irrigation control
    is presented in Section III. Results and observations are presented in Section
    IV. Conclusions are drawn from the obtained results and analysis in Section V.
    SECTION II. System Architecture and Design Fig. 1: IoT architecture of the smart
    irrigation system Show All The IoT architecture used for implementing the precision
    irrigation system is shown in Fig. 1. The components of the architecture are listed
    in Tab. I. The components are selected based on cost-reliability analysis. While
    the low-cost sensors lead to reliability issues, they perform reasonably well
    for the application considered. In this work low cost soil moisture and flow sensors
    are used. The sensors send the data to the WEMOS D1 controller and the controller
    controls the flow using sensed information. The controller controls the solenoid
    valve through which the field is irrigated. The controller also controls the DC
    motor on/off state since the motor has to be on only when any one of the valve
    is in open state. The controller is connected to the internet through the GSM
    GPRS module. The internet connectivity is provided through GSM as broadband is
    not feasible in many rural agricultural areas, whereas more than 70% of the land
    in India is feasible with GSM based cellular network. The information retrieved
    from the field is used to control the irrigation system, and it is also stored
    in the cloud (Thingspeak) for further analysis. Remote monitoring of the field
    was provided through web interface and mobile interface. The farm is split into
    several sectors as depicted in Fig. 2, the water flows through different valves
    for each sector which are deployed with a set of sensors for monitoring and a
    solenoid valve as an actuator. The sectors are sort of control regimes for which
    the water can be irrigated. This helps organizing the irrigation and monitoring
    to meet the needs of the individual sectors, thereby better management can be
    achieved. Having described the architecture, we provide a succinct description
    of the different components used in the hardware. Fig. 2: Organization of agriculture
    land as sectors Show All Table I: Components of the architecture 1) WEMOS D1 Controller
    The D1 is an ESP8266 (Wi-Fi) based controller which is compatible with the Arduino
    IDE. The functions are same as the Arduino Uno controller, whereas the WEMOS has
    the ESP8266 module by default on the board hence reducing the complexity of interfacing
    an ESP8266 with Arduino Uno. ADCs(Analog to Digital convertors) were used to interface
    multiple analog sensors to the controller. 2) Solenoid Valve The traditional valves
    are replaced with solenoid valves to control the flow. The valve is operated either
    in ON/OFF mode and a pulse-width modulation approach is used to control the flow,
    i.e., the amount of flow is proportional to the time-period for which the valve
    remains in ON state over a given time period. A 24 V relay is used to turn ON/OFF
    the solenoid valve. 3) Soil Moisture Sensor In our design, YL69 series soil moisture
    sensor or probe measures the volumetric water content in the soil. Determining
    soil moisture is considered as an important task in agriculture to assist farmers
    manage the irrigation systems more effectively. Compared to other low cost sensor
    such as gypsum block sensors, these probes tender a rapid response time. Due to
    this reason the sensor is chosen and used in the proposed design. Placing the
    soil moisture sensor in the right place is very important, since a sector''s irrigation
    is controlled by the value of the soil moisture sensor deployed for that sector.
    The soil moisture sensor works between 3.3V and 5V power supply. The output value
    of the sensor is between 0 ohms to 1000 ohms. Based on the sensor reading the
    soil can be classified into Dry, Humid and wet. The soil moisture sensor used
    is connected to the analog pin of the controller through wire. The sensor range
    for determining the soil type is shown in Tab. II. Table II: Resistance range
    of soil moisture sensor 4) Flow Sensor In this system flow sensor (YF-201) is
    used to measure the amount of water utilized in the process of irrigation. The
    amount of water utilized has to be measured in the experimental setup for the
    traditional and automated irrigation methods so that comparison can be easily
    carried out. The water flow sensor is aligned in parallel with the water line,
    and a pinwheel inside the sensor is used for measuring the water irrigated through
    it. The water flow is measured in litres/second. 5) Data Transmission Transferring
    the collected information from the farm to the Internet is a major issue as internet
    connectivity through broadband to agricultural area is still an infeasible solution
    in more than 50% of the agricultural lands across India. In this work the data
    is transmitted using the GPRS internet connectivity available through the cellular
    network providers. The cellular network covers majority of the agricultural lands
    in India and with the emergence of 3G and 4G technology it is possible to transmit
    data quickly. Instead of using a GPRS module along with the controller, we have
    used a Wi-Fi hotspot device for data transmission from the controller to the internet
    as the transmission speed is high when using hot spot as compared with a GSM GPRS
    module of the controller. The use of WEMOS controller has reduced the complexity
    in interfacing an ESP8266 when compared to Arduino. The GSM module is used to
    send messages from the controller regarding the status of the field. Fig. 3: ThingSpeak
    web interface Show All Table III: Sample data stored in thingspeak A. Cloud-Based
    Remote Monitoring The Irrigation system is initiated based on the soil moisture
    sensor value. The field is irrigated automatically using the solenoid valve or
    sprinkler. The solenoid valve and the sprinkler were connected to the controller
    using relay switch. The data from the controller is transmitted to the Thingspeak
    cloud, and the data can be viewed using Thingspeak website. The user interface
    is a simple monitoring interface which shows the readings from the sensor, the
    solenoid valve status and the amount of water used. The screen shot of the ThingSpeak
    web interface is shown in Fig. 4 and the snippet of the data displayed is shown
    in Table III. Similarly the PH value of the soil, Humidity and temperature were
    also stored in cloud. Thingspeak cloud service is an easy to access service and
    has inbuilt lab view functions. Fig. 4 shows the Thingspeak Cloud Service Interface
    for a smart phone wherein the data are represented in charts. The data feeds can
    be stored in the Thingspeak along with the timestamp for further analysis and
    for providing real-time data visualization. Fig. 4: ThingSpeak interface for smart
    phone Show All SECTION III. Optimization Model Computing the minimum irrigation
    rates based on sensed information is a decision making problem requiring help
    of optimization tools. Therefore, we model the optimal irrigation problem as an
    optimization problem. We define the following: Definition 1 The difference between
    the planting and harvesting time is denoted as the irrigation period. Definition
    2 Maximal rainfall over the irrigation period denoted by R max is the upper bound
    on the rainfall during the period. Our objective is to minimize the irrigation
    of the water over a 24 hour horizon which is given by I= ∑ t =QΔt where Q denotes
    the flow and Δ unit time step used in the analysis. In addition, we aim to exploit
    the use of rain water, and soil moisture content. the objective is modelled as:
    J= w 1 (t) S t + w 2 r t + w 3 (t)Q(t)Δ ∀t∈{t+Δ,t+2Δ,…,t+TΔ} (1) View Source by:
    where w 1 , w 2 and w 3 are weighing factors, S t soil moisture content at time
    t , and the weights are selected depending on the crop or soil conditions. Limits
    on the rainfall r are given by R min ≤ r t ≤ R max ∀t∈{t+Δ,t+2Δ,…,t+TΔ} (2) View
    Source where R max and R min denote the maximum and minimum values of the rainfall
    during the period. The upper limit on the irrigation is given by ∑ t=t+Δ t+TΔ
    Q(t)Δ≤I (3) View Source Following [21], the irrigation at time periods is limited
    by Q(t)≥ ( e t − r t − S t + d t ) Δ Q(t)≤ W R max (t)− r t − S t + d t Δ (4)
    View Source where e t is the threshold on water use, d t water drained, and W
    R max maximum water reserve, respectively. In addition, the evapotranspiration
    rate is constrained by EP(t)≤ r t + S t +Q(t)Δ− d t ∀t (5) View Source In addition,
    the rainfall, soil moisture, flow-rate, and drain are all positive real-values
    and this is expressed as r t , S t , d t ,Q(t)≥0 (6) View Source The optimization
    model for reducing the irrigation is given by M: min Q(t) w 1 (t) S t + w 2 (t)

    ∀t∈{t+Δ,t+2Δ,…,t+TΔ} View Source The optimization model M is a linear programming
    problem and can be solved with open source solvers such as Gnu Linear Programming
    Kit on single-board computers such as BeagleBone Black. However, in our analysis,
    the problem was solved in a computer using MATLAB''s linprog routine. SECTION
    IV. Results A. Real-Time Experiments In our experiments, a pilot having four land
    sectors each 2×2 square feet were taken to test the method. One sector was irrigated
    using traditional method in which the water flow was controlled manually, and
    the other three (Automated Irrigation, Drip Irrigation, Sprinkler Irrigation)
    were irrigated with the automated method using sensors and actuators (solenoid
    valve, sprinkler, and Drip). The spinach named Amaranthus tricolor seeds was sown
    in even quantity and grown in the entire four land sector. Water flow sensor,
    soil moisture sensor, soil PH sensor, was installed in all the sectors. Weather
    sensors like humidity, temperature Sensor and rain sensor were deployed in common
    for all the four sectors. The actuators were connected to the controller using
    wired connection. The input to the sprinkler was given using a low pressure water
    pipe as the land sector taken for irrigation is small. The irrigation was done
    based on the moisture sensor value. Different moisture values are set for different
    crops, in the experimental set up the value was set to less than 300 ohms to 950
    ohms, if the value drops below 300 ohms then the solenoid valves were opened and
    the field is irrigated and if the value was greater than 950 ohms then the solenoid
    valves were closed. For drip irrigation automation, the solenoid valves were used
    to supply water to the drip irrigation tube. In the sprinkler irrigation system
    sprinkler is supplied with a low pressure water input as the experimental prototype
    is for demonstration purpose. The soil moisture metric used to automate the irrigation
    makes sure that the land is not dry at any point of time. The data is uploaded
    to the things speak cloud using write API key. The experiments were conducted
    for a period of 3 weeks. To test the effectiveness of the optimization approach,
    we first propose a moisture based control as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5: Moisture-based
    control Show All The following two scenarios were compared: Flow control based
    on moisture level with valve control, sprinkler control, and drip irrigation;
    Flow control using optimization approach with valve irrigation, sprinkler control,
    and drip irrigation; In the optimization model, the change in irrigation conditions
    correlate to change in the limits of the flow-rates Q(t) . B. Results with Heuristic
    Control The flows for a period of 3 weeks were used to study the effectiveness
    of the flow-based control. The results of all three automated irrigation methods
    were compared with conventional method. In Drip irrigation method the system is
    highly efficient saving around 24%, compared to 20% in sprinkler and 16% in Solenoid
    valve based automated irrigation. In this experimental prototype, deficient watering
    condition was eliminated as the water resources were sufficient throughout the
    experiment. Water deficit might occur when the system is implemented in the real
    agricultural field due to water scarcity. The data is stored in cloud with ease
    using the API funtions in thingspeak. The flow control over for a period of six
    days with flow-based control is shown in Fig. 6 shows that the drip irrigation
    the flow is relatively lower than other irrigation systems. C. Simulation Results
    with Optimization Based Control The flows for a period of 1 week with optimization
    based control was used to study the effectiveness of optimization based control
    for the three irrigation schemes. In drip irrigation method the method provided
    31.2% over conventional method and an increase in 7% savings over flow-based control.
    Similarly, in sprinkler irrigation, the savings were 26% and 22% in solenoid valve
    based control. Our simulations shows that optimization based control outperforms
    the flow-based control in terms of water savings. Fig. 6: Automated versus manual
    control with sprinkler system for flow-based control Show All Fig. 7: Automated
    versus manual control with sprinkler system for optimization-based control Show
    All D. Observations It was observed that the pH value of the soil decreases with
    an increase in moisture levels. The IoT and cloud-connectivity enhanced the data-aggregation
    and visualization capability significantly. Combining IoT, cloud-connectivity,
    and optimization models will help enhance water efficiency of the agriculture
    systems. The irrigation system was automated by connecting solenoid values which
    helped increase the agility of the control. SECTION V. Conclusions This investigation
    presented an automated irrigation system to reduce water utilization in agriculture
    by combining Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and optimization. The
    automated irrigation system is realized by deploying low-cost sensors to sense
    variables of interest such as pH, temperature, humidity, soil type and weather
    conditions. The data is stored in Thingspeak cloud service for monitoring and
    storage. Then an optimization model for reducing the water usage was proposed
    and constraints modelling the physical conditions were included. The optimal flow
    rate was determined solving the optimization model and it was shown that the flow
    rate can be automated using solenoid valves. The optimization-based control was
    compared with flow-based control and our results demonstrated that optimization
    models help in reducing the water consumption. Improving the optimization models
    and enhancing the IoT prototype are future course of this investigation. Authors

    Croatia SECTION I. Introduction Precision irrigation is an important strategy
    for water saving based on measuring the variability in space of soil properties
    and crop responses. Due to the increasing risk of drought in the Mediterranean
    area, the adoption of precision irrigation technologies is likely to increase.
    This paper presents a smart platform for precision irrigation that was developed
    within the ALADIN project funded by the research and innovation program of the
    region Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The main technical novelty is that the proposed
    solution is a complete platform that operates linear irrigation machines thanks
    to a decision support system(Irriframe [1]), which exploits vegetation maps obtained
    from an aerial survey. The platform has a distributed architecture, including
    a server node, embedded IoT devices to operate the irrigation machines and a mobile
    application for user interaction. Irriframe is a free decision support system
    for irrigation scheduling. The conventional use of Irriframe is to provide information
    about when to irrigate as well as the water quantity to be uniformly supplied
    across the field. Irriframe is based on a water balance model that usually considers
    geographic, meteorological and soil data. One of the contributions of this work
    is to query the decision support system by sending a vegetation map, obtained
    from an aerial survey, that is used to improve the water balance model as it provides
    a high resolution measurement of the actual crop vigor. To this purpose an unmanned
    aerial vehicle(UAV) was equipped with a vision sensor to perform an aerial survey,
    and software tools were developed for processing the resulting vegetation map.
    Therefore, the output of an Irriframe query to the server of the precision irrigation
    platform is an irrigation map that provides the amount of water to be supplied
    in each cell of the field rather than a uniform water quantity for the whole field.
    The detailed irrigation map is then converted to an irrigation plan, i.e., a sequence
    of machine commands for the irrigation machine deployed on the field. The irrigation
    process can be controlled and monitored in real-time by the farmer by using the
    mobile application that receives the irrigation plan from the server. In the implemented
    prototype of the smart irrigation platform, the adopted machine is a linear moving
    system that consists of a hose-fed irrigation boom. Variable rate irrigation is
    achieved by changing the hose rewind speed. Preliminary experiments are reported
    that were performed in tomato fields to test the main components of the platform.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the state of the art. Section
    III describes the architecture of the smart irrigation platform. Section IV presents
    the experimental results with the implemented prototype, while Section V concludes
    the work. SECTION II. Related Work Most works on variable rate irrigation for
    precision agriculture investigated the use of fixed sprinklers, while in this
    paper a fully integrated platform is presented for a linear irrigation system.
    Moreover, while sensors networks on the ground are usually exploited to compute
    a water balance and to provide an irrigation schedule [2]–[7], in this work a
    decision support system is adopted that includes aerial measurements. In [3] a
    wireless network of moisture and conductivity sensors was developed and tested
    in several farms. Chikankar et al. [4] presented an automatic irrigation system
    using ZigBee for power efficiency. In [7] a prototype of a complete context aware
    wireless irrigation system was developed and evaluated using a single fixed, remotely
    controllable rotating sprinkler. The communication between the decision support
    system and the farmer is a key topic in precision farming. Early works in precision
    farming adopted the short message service(SMS) [8]–[10], while in this work a
    mobile application was developed to provide user-friendly interaction. Fig. 1.
    Architecture of the Smart Irrigation Platform. Show All To increase the amount
    of saved water few authors investigated the use of continuous move irrigation
    systems that support control of individual sprinklers [11]–[13]. While promising,
    such technologies are still not available in commercial products. In [11] an electronically
    controllable linear irrigation system was presented with individual control of
    sprinklers based on a distributed sensor network. In [12] a remote monitoring
    and control system was developed for a lateral move irrigation system. Camp et.
    al [13] proposed a modified center pivot system for variable-rate application
    of water and nutrients. The use of aerial vehicles for precision agriculture has
    become widespread [14]–[17]. However, as stated before, integration of UAV data
    in decision support systems for automated precision farming has not been considered
    in previous works. A standard technique in UAV surveys is to generate an accurate
    terrain mosaic from a sequence of multispectral images, and then to compute a
    vegetation index [15]. Murugan et al. [17] proposed an approach that fuses UAV
    and satellite images. Thermal sensors can also be adopted in conjunction with
    multispectral cameras [14]. SECTION III. Smart Irrigation Platform The smart irrigation
    platform described in this paper is composed by several interacting subsystems,
    as shown in Figure 1. A UAV is programmed to fly over the field to be irrigated.
    The aerial vehicle is equipped with a vision sensor. Geolocalized images taken
    during the flight are used to produce vegetation maps. The Ortophoto Processing
    Module provides a semiautomatic software tool to rotate and to downsample a vegetation
    map by defining a customized grid. The result is then saved as a GeoJSON file
    and sent to the Irrigation Platform Server. The Irrigation Platform Server is
    the core subsystem, exposing RESTful services to the Ortophoto Processing Module
    and to the Mobile App. The Irrigation Platform Server also interacts with Irriframe,
    which accepts GeoJSON files as input and computes an irrigation map that contains
    the amount of water to be supplied in each cell of the field. The Mobile App allows
    end users to request irrigation plans for their machines from the Irrigation Platform
    Server. Each irrigation plan is a list of commands for an irrigation machine,
    which is computed by the Irrigation Platform Server from an irrigation map provided
    by Irriframe. Further details on the subsystems and functional processes of the
    smart irrigation platform are provided in the following subsections, which also
    illustrate the prototype that has been implemented. A. Irrigation Platform Server
    The Irrigation Platform Server enables three main processes, namely End User Fields/Machines
    Mapping, Vegetation Map Upload, Irrigation Plan Computation. End users authenticate
    to the platform by means of their Irriframe account. Irriframe may provide the
    server with the list of fields owned by the end user, but it is not aware of her/his
    irrigation machines. By means of the Mobile App, the end user inputs a list of
    irrigation machines, which is stored within the database of the Irrigation Platform
    Server. At any time, an irrigation machine can be added/removed and associated
    to a specific field, by means of the mobile app. The Irrigation Platform Server
    exposes a RESTful service for uploading a vegetation map exported in GeoJSON file
    format by the software tool described in Subsection III -C. The software tool
    itself is provided with client features for invoking the uploading service. Finally,
    the farmer is enabled to request the Irrigation Platform Server to compute the
    irrigation plan, by providing field and irrigation machine details by means of
    the Mobile App(detailed in Subsection III -B). The Irrigation Platform Server
    generates the irrigation plan for the specified machine and field, according to
    the latest irrigation map provided by Irriframe. The irrigation plan is returned
    to the Mobile App, which forwards it to the embedded IoT device that controls
    the irrigation machine. An Irrigation Platform Server prototype was implemented
    using Node.js [18], a JavaScript runtime based on Google Chrome''s engine for
    easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven,
    non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, suitable for data-intensive
    real-time(DIRT) applications that run across distributed devices. Node.js allows
    a server to hold a number of connections open while handling many requests and
    keeping a small memory footprint. It is designed to be responsive, like the browser.
    Node.js is also highly modular. Modules can be easily developed, packaged and
    used. The npm repository is an online collection of ready-to-use Node.js modules.
    For example, the https module was used to provide Node.js with the capabilities
    of an HTTPS(HTTP protocol over TLS/SSL) server. The Irrigation Platform Server
    prototype exposes RESTful services developed by means of the express module for
    Node.js. With respect to competing modules restify and loopback, express is more
    efficient [19]. The REST API exposed by the irrigation platform server is available
    at the following URL: https://aladinirrigation.ddns.net/ Moreover, the Irrigation
    Platform Server prototype maintains a non-relational database, implemented within
    the MongoDB [20] document-oriented database management system. In this approach,
    every document collects all the data associated to an entity, in such a way that
    any application can treat the entity as a self-contained object and skip the computational
    burden of aggregating data to extract information related to the same entity,
    which is typical of relational databases. Such an enormous efficiency advantage
    is partially reduced by the need to preserve the consistence across partially
    duplicated documents. Collections in the aforementioned database have been designed
    for being as much as possible decoupled, in order to prevent inconsistency issues.
    Users may be either Farmers or Uploaders. Farmers have non-empty lists of fields
    and machines. Uploaders do not have fields or machines, but are enabled to upload
    NDVI Maps to the Irrigation Platform Server. RasterImgs contains references to
    vegetation map files which are stored in the file system and accessed by means
    of the fs Node.js module. Several images may be associated to the same field.
    They have meaningful name, extension and date(with ms precision). Irrigations
    contains the list of performed irrigations, detailing the farmer, field, tools(irrigation
    machine and terminals) and date. Machines contains irrigation machine descriptions,
    with parameters such as flow rate, and the list of all acceptable commands(described
    in Subsection III -D). Terminals contains technical information about the terminals
    that can be associated to the irrigation machines, such as hose-fed irrigation
    booms. B. Mobile App For the farmer, the Mobile App plays the role of single virtual
    access point to the smart platform. More precisely, the Mobile App allows the
    farmer to register user data on the decision support system, to request an irrigation
    plan from the server, and to control the irrigation process with real-time monitoring.
    The Mobile App prototype is based on Apache Cordova [21] and Framework 7 [22].
    Apache Cordova is a framework for developing mobile apps with HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
    targeting multiple platforms with one code base. It is free and open source. Framework
    7 is an HTML5 framework simplifying the development of hybrid applications with
    native look and feel, and an effective prototyping tool. Fig. 2. Mobile App: login

    4. Mobile App: configuration of the smart irrigation process. Show All The implemented
    Mobile App has a Single View layout, with Tab-bar, Nav-bar and side panels for
    navigation purposes. The main advantage of this approach is that content is fully
    loaded when the application is started, for enhanced responsiveness and improved
    user experience. Fig. 5. Unmanned aerial vehicle used for surveying and mapping
    crop fields. Show All Fig. 6. Raw NDVI vegetation map(left) in a tomato field.
    Rotated image(right) with superimposed grid(red lines). Show All Since part of
    the visualized information comes from Irriframe, to start the Mobile App the Farmer
    is required to perform a login process using Irriframe credentials(Figure 2).
    After login, it is possible to enter the panels for managing the farmer''s fields
    and irrigation machines. The Fields panel lists the fields owned by the farmer.
    For each field, it is possible to visualize the coordinates of the centroid of
    the field, the farmer''s company name(if any), the type of crop and the adopted
    irrigation approach(Figure 3). On the map, the borders of the selected field are
    also displayed. The Machines panel lists the irrigation machines owned by the
    farmer. For each machine, it is possible to know the current location. Moreover,
    it is possible to start the smart irrigation process, upon specifying some mandatory
    input parameters, such as pressure, nozzle cut height, gear(Figure 4). Finally,
    it is possible to monitor the elapsed time and the percentage of completion of
    all ongoing processes. C. Integration Of Vegetation Map From Aerial Imagery After
    each flight of the UAV, all collected images are processed(by the Ortophoto Processing
    Module) to create orthophotos of the RGB bands of the camera. Using a single camera,
    instead of more advanced multispectral sensors, still enables the computation
    of a vegetation index although it slightly degrades its sensitivity. Indeed, a
    red band cut-off filter is used in place of the standard NIR filter of the camera.
    Therefore, the red channel contains the NIR(Near-infrared) radiation. A vegetation
    map(in GeoTIFF format) of the field is then computed that contains for each pixel
    the NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) index, defined as NDVI= NIR−BLUE
    NIR+BLUE (1) View Source Fig. 7. The irrigation machine that was used to test
    the smart irrigation platform. The total width of the wings is 40 m. Show All
    Fig. 8. Embedded IoT device and irrigation machine electronic control unit(ECU).
    Show All Figure 6(left) shows an example of an NDVI vegetation map obtained in
    a tomato field in gray scale. A semi-automatic software tool was developed to
    rotate the raw NDVI vegetation map so that the crop rows are aligned with the
    vertical y-axis of the image. The algorithm extracts the principal direction of
    the crop rows by computing the Hough transform of the image. If the algorithms
    fails to detect the correct rotation angle a manual correction can be inserted
    by the user. Figure 6(right) shows the NDVI vegetation map of the example tomato
    field obtained after automatic rotation. The software tool also allows to perform
    average downsampling of the NDVI vegetation map by defining a grid of cells(red
    grid in Figure 6, right) at a lower-resolution. The resolution of the grid can
    be selected according to the actual performance of the irrigation machine(about
    10 m resolution in the current setup). The result is exported to GeoJSON file
    format. D. Automatic Programming Of Irrigation Machine The linear irrigation machine
    considered in this work is a hose-fed irrigation boom. The one that was actually
    used to test the smart irrigation platform prototypes is shown in Figure 7. Since
    the water pressure at each sprinkler is constant, variable rate irrigation is
    achieved by changing the hose rewind speed of each horizontal section of the field
    as explained next. The irrigation machine is automatically programmed by an embedded
    IoT device designed to execute and to monitor the irrigation plan. The irrigation
    machine used for testing purposes is controlled at low level by a Rain 260 electronic
    control unit(ECU), by RM Irrigation Equipment S.p.A. The ECU accepts commands
    to start and to stop the irrigation, to set the rewind speed, to read the length
    of the unrolled hose, and to pause irrigation in case of damage. The embedded
    IoT device consists of a Raspberry Pi3 with a GPS receiver, and runs a software
    based on Redis [23], an open-source inmemory key-value framework. The embedded
    IoT device is connected to the ECU through a RS-232 cable, and it also communicates
    with the Mobile App and the Irrigation Platform Server through a 4G network connection.
    The embedded IoT device and the irrigation machine electronic control unit are
    shown in Figure 8. All commands contained in an irrigation plan are stored in
    a Redis queue and executed sequentially. Each command specifies how to irrigate
    a section of the field. In particular, a command consists of a pair ( v i , l
    i ) , where v i is the desired rewind speed set-point, and l i is the length of
    the i− th section of the field. The speed value v i is set as inversely proportional
    to the average water quantity to be supplied to the i− th section, i.e. v i =
    k 1 N i ∑ N i j=1 w ij (2) View Source where w ij is the amount of water in the
    irrigation map to be supplied to cell (i,j), N i is the total number of cells
    in section i and k is a constant value that depends on internal machine parameters(water
    pressure, boom length, nozzle cut height and gear). A control loop in the embedded
    IoT device monitors in real-time the position of the boom in the field by polling
    the current length of the unrolled hose from the ECU. If the field width is greater
    than the length of the boom, irrigation must be stopped at the end of the current
    lane and restarted, after repositioning the boom at the beginning of the next
    lane. The GPS signal is used before starting the irrigation of each lane of the
    field to check whether the initial position of the boom is correct. SECTION IV.
    Experimental Evaluation We report preliminary experiments that were carried out
    to test the main components of the system separately. A first experiment was conducted
    for the aerial system. The adopted aerial vehicle is shown in Figure 5. The UAV
    is a VirtualRobotix SPARK quadcopter (340 × 340 mm size, 190 mm height) with a
    payload of about 300 g. The estimated autonomy is up to 22 minutes. The UAV is
    powered by a VR Brain 5.2 board and it features a composite endoskeleton with
    power distribution features. The UAV is equipped with a Raspberry Pi3 computer
    and a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera(V2). The camera has a Sony IMX219 CMOS sensor(8
    megapixel) and it features a maximal resolution of 3280×2464 pixels(30 fps). Radiometric
    calibration is performed by using a reference target. Fig. 9. NDVI image generated
    after a test flight in a tomato field. Show All Fig. 10. Irrigation plan for a
    test field 60×40m( Marzolara, Bologna). The scheduled amount of water w and the
    rewind speed v are reported for each section of the field. Irrigation direction
    is from bottom to top. Show All Fig. 11. Image from the irrigation test described
    in Figure 10. Show All The UAV was programmed to perform a flight mission over
    a tomato field (100 × 150 m) in Vigheffio(Parma). A total of 73 images were acquired
    and the obtained NDVI orthophoto is shown in Figure 9. The NDVI values range from
    0.25 (red) in non-crop regions, like in a nearby road, to 0.39 (green) for vegetation.
    The experiment indicates that the aerial system is capable of generating plausible
    NDVI images, even though with limited sensitivity. Moreover, being the test field
    well vegetated the resulting NDVI image exhibits a low-variance on the crop region.
    The result was not unexpected as the specific test field available for the project
    experimentation had a limited spatial heterogeneity of soil. Fig. 12. Actual vs
    expected amount of water supplied to the field in the test described in Figure
    10, from 60 m(start) to 0 m(end). Show All Evaluation of the automated irrigation
    process was performed in a tomato field (60 m× 40 m) in Marzolara(Bologna) using
    a custom-built irrigation map. The irrigation map was automatically converted
    by the platform server to an irrigation plan that consists of five sections of
    different length, as shown in Figure 10. Then, the irrigation was started by using
    the mobile application. The top speed was about 115 m/h. Figure 11 shows a picture
    taken during the irrigation test. The graph in Figure 12 illustrates a comparison
    between the actual amount of water that was supplied to the field, measured by
    rain gauges, and the expected one. Although an induced delay can be observed due
    to the hydraulic system, it can be noticed that the supplied amount of water follows
    the expected value. SECTION V. Conclusion In this work a distributed smart precision
    agriculture platform was presented for a linear irrigation system. The platform
    exploits a decision support system that generates an irrigation map by integrating
    geographic, meteorological and soil data as well as a vegetation map computed
    from an aerial survey. The irrigation map is converted to an irrigation plan,
    i.e., a list of machine commands. The irrigation process can be started and monitored
    by the farmer thanks to a mobile application. Preliminary experiments have been
    reported in tomato fields. Additional experiments are planned to evaluate more
    thoroughly the proposed platform. Future work will address the online optimization
    of the irrigation process based on water supply monitoring performed on the irrigation
    machine. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the ALADIN collaborative

    Location: Marrakech, Morocco SECTION I. Introduction The demand of food production
    and fiber increase with de world population. The irrigation management is important
    particularly in context where the fresh water resources are limited. The aim of
    the irrigation is to give to plants the adequate amount of water to ensure their
    water requirements. The use of Water Production Function (WPF) allows to estimate
    the production in terms of dry matter or marketable yield, evapotranspiration
    ore the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). According to the different
    production functions of IW may also include different components in addition to
    Crop Water Requirement (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to prepare the seeding,
    leaching requirement to decrease the salinity, rise of water table by capillarity
    and rainfall. The estimation of water requirement is a stone corner which you
    can calculate the correct irrigation doses. Indeed, the water available for the
    crop is an indicator of the texture of soil, precipitations, previous irrigations,
    state of development of crop and the amount of water already present in the soil.
    Center-Pivot of irrigation are usually reserved to irrigate large areas from 3.5
    to 65 ha because of the costs; but, the nutrients, fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide
    and pesticide can be directly applied on the canopy of crop [1]. Center-Pivot
    irrigation systems require up to 40% less water application than traditional and
    conventional gravity (furrow) or surface irrigation methods, where a part of water
    is lost by percolation or runoff. But Center-pivot irrigation stays less effective
    than the drip systems that are the most economical in term of water. The main
    challenge is related to the exact estimation of both the evapotranspiration of
    the crop and how to bring the water (frequency and quantity). Traditional hand-feel
    soil measurement methods do not provide quantitative soil water and real-time
    data. The use of sensors in precision agriculture is becoming widespread, especially
    in irrigation and open the field of irrigation management in order to establish
    an optimal timing and amount of irrigation water for greatest effectiveness. Indeed,
    an optimal irrigation management avoid water deficiency and use too much water
    that reduces the potential for profitability of the crop. The supply of an optimal
    amount of water allows also to maximize the yield response to other management
    practices, optimize yield per unit of water applied, reduce the potential runoff,
    reduce soil erosion and pesticide movement into the surface and ground water [1].
    To optimize the yield and soil water in the crop, plants should not pass the wilting
    point. This means the minimum soil moisture required by a plant not to wilt. At
    this point, any decrease in soil moisture will result in wilting. When a plant
    wilts, its leaves dry out, droop, and wither. The coupling of the irrigation system
    with a soil moisture monitoring and an accurate evapotranspiration calculation
    has a significant advantage in term of water consumption. Precision agriculture
    (PA) uses the Internet of Things and allows real-time control measure and automation
    of pivot-center irrigation systems. Furthermore, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN)
    is affordable and the wide availability of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol
    such as LoRa, SigFox and Ingenu coupling with cloud IoT platforms pave the way
    of high precision and realtime irrigation management systems. In this paper, we
    combine agronomic and computer science expertise to propose a cloud IoT architecture
    and a network of sensors using LPWA to control, monitor and optimize the crop
    production at quasi real-time. The low-cost sensor network measure on one hand
    the weather data required to calculate potential evapotranspiration of the crop,
    and on other hand the soil moisture at different depths. The proposed architecture
    calculates water requirements of plants and actuate solenoids to open and close
    water individually each sprinkler. SECTION II. Literature Review The main challenges
    in the elaboration of an automated irrigation system for irrigation pivot-center
    are vital; on one hand to choose an adapted evaluation method of water requirements,
    and on other hand to identify a correct cloud IoT platform essential for data
    storage and treatment. The following paragraph focuses on these aspects and on
    reviewing existing works. A. Related Works Classical Water Production Functions
    (WPF) are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield
    reduction due to deficit irrigation which is usually based on linear regression
    and don''t give a representation of nonlinear behaviors of complex ecological
    systems. To fix this issue recent research are investigated. We list the use of
    more robust and nonlinear techniques such as machine learning, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and data-mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al in 2010 [2], Dai et al.
    in 2011 [3], Haghverdi et al. in 2014 [4] and Elnesr et al., in 2016 [5]). In
    this study we follow two different controls. The first model consists to control
    the speed of travelling of the central-pivot for a constant flow rate. The second
    uses an electronic control to adapt flow rate in the nozzles. The speed of travelling
    of the central-pivot is maintained constant. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    allows to save 9-19% of irrigation water and to address field-level spatio-temporal
    heterogeneity in terms of soil water holding capacity and depth of soil [6]. According
    to Pan et al in 2013 [7] VRI allows also to enhance water-use efficiency, improve
    productivity, reduce fuel consummation and reduce nutrient leaching. The choice
    of sprinkler package, the pressure of working, meteorological conditions and tower
    dynamics affect the irrigation water distribution pattern [8]. Moreover, variations
    in micro-meteorological and technical conditions can modify the water application
    depth and irrigation uniformity at different lateral positions with flow control
    nozzles or pressure regulators at each head [8]. Wind speed and direction don''t
    significantly modify the uniformity of water applicatIon but impact the absolute
    application depth of zones under VRI management [9]. To adapt flow of irrigation
    soils moisture measure must be done. Traditional soil moisture sensors need to
    be installed early in the growing season and must be removed before the harvesting.
    Dong et al in 2013 [1] has proposed a cyber-physical system based on underground
    sensors to monitor soil moisture but this approach do not monitor soil on only
    one depth [1]. The interest of the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and Remote Sensing (RS) with Internet of Things (IoT) has been demonstrated by
    different authors such as Li et al. in 2012 [10] Ye et al. in 2013 [11] Wang et
    al., 2013 [12]. B. Estimations of Water Requirements The estimation of water requirements
    of crop (ETc) can be estimated from a simple soil water balance (SSWB) model.
    A general form of the soil water balance is done by the following equation: ETc=I+P+F+R+ΔS
    (1) View Source Where I is the irrigation dose [mm], P is the precipitation [mm],
    F is the net subsurface flow into the control volume [mm], R is net runoff or
    runon to the control volume surface [mm] and ΔS is the net change in soil water
    stored in the control volume [mm]. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can
    be calculated by using different methods. A common one requires several weather
    data that are not all the time available. Among these methods, we mention Penman-Monteith
    [13] FAO56 PM) which ranked as the best method for estimating daily and monthly
    ET for all climates. Penman [14] (FAO24), Penman [15] (FAO-ppp-17), Kimberly-Penman
    [16], Hamon [17], Hargreaves [18], Haude [19], Penman [20], Penman-Monteith [21],
    Priestley-Taylor [22], Makkink [23], McCl [24], De Bruin-Keijman [25] (DK), Jensen-Haise
    [16], Blaney-Criddle [26] (BC), Blaney-Criddle [14] (FAO 24 BC), FAO 24 Radiation
    [14], Turc [27], Wendling [28], Valiantzas [29]. Nevertheless, modern technologies
    such as the use of Wireless Infrared Thermometers (IRT) appear to measure surface
    temperature and determine the ETc [30]. A comparison of 16 among the models mentioned
    above has been carried out by Liu et al. in 2017 [31] and have shown that FAO-ppp-17,
    Pen-63 and FAO-24 BC are the better results in semi-arid climate. Therefore, we
    notice that a poor calibration between all the aforementioned researchers lead
    to inconsistent results of existing studies on weighting lysimeter. Indeed, Jensen
    et al. report that FA024BC is better [32]. While Yoder et al. in 2005 [33] and
    Lépez-Urrea et al. in 2006 [34] find that FA056 PM is the better formula. Otherwise
    some authors such as Berengena et al. in 2005 [35], Howell et al. in 1998 [36]
    have proven that the adjustment of the Penman formula coefficients at local scale
    shows significantly performing results. To conclude, we assume that FA056 PM or
    FA024 BC can be tested as a first approach in the evaluation of the evapotranspiration
    and a precise evaluation can be obtained locally by adjusting the parameters of
    the original Penman equation. The local adjustment of coefficient of the Penman
    formula need the use of lysimeters and a long experimentation which is not always
    achievable out of research centres. The Maximal Evapotranspiration (MET) of a
    crop can be calculated at different vegetative stage when amount of water is sufficiently
    available and agronomic condition are optimal. The MET can be calculated by model
    but in real conditions, and the Real Evapotranspiration (RE) is inferior in amount
    calculated by model. By consequence, it''s important to measure accurately real
    evapotranspiration by mean of sensors to provide the necessary quantities of water
    and to avoid percolation losses related to excessive intake linked in particular
    to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. C. Choice of Sensors Both
    approaches can be followed. The first one uses commercial sensing solutions which
    natively provide a wide range of features directly and allows researchers to focus
    on the developments of algorithms and meta-processing, etc. The second one uses
    open hardware solutions which are programmable and flexible allowing to developers
    to have the full control of the behaviors of the nodes [37] The first approach
    is particularly interesting to develop proof of concept but makes researchers
    dependent of one provider and the availability of sensors used for development.
    Moreover, the rapid turnover of product of high technology renders this science
    stream especially risked for long term developments. The second way although requiring
    further development is more sustainable and is generally supported by a large
    community of developers. The choice of sensors is crucial because nodes can move
    over time that causes considerable interferences in the communication between
    nodes. Moreover, the influence of temperature, humidity, rainfall, sandstorm and
    high solar radiation greatly affect the links and communication quality among
    the nodes, particularly in harsh environmental conditions. The high temperature
    encountered in semiarid environments affects significantly the received signal
    strength (RSS). The humidity linked to the irrigation system and the heavy rainfall
    intensely affects the propagation of radio waves. The choice of the wireless transceiver
    and the transmission protocol must take into account the number of nodes, the
    distances between them, the height of antenna and the operating frequency based
    on the desired size of payload [37]. D. Cloud IoT Platform The correct choice
    of the IoT Platform to build a solution can affect the overall success of the
    project [37]. Both explorable approaches acquire and manage the underlying hardware
    and software layers or use a commercial offering which provides all needed services
    to propose an integrative solution. A review proposed by Ray PP in 2016 compare
    the 26 most popular IoT cloud platforms based on the following parameters: deployment
    service, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data
    management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization and research.
    According to Ray in 2016 [38], they should have at least 49 IoT cloud platforms
    present in the actual global market. Nowadays, any commercial or open source cloud
    platform allows to deploy, and hosts applications or models elaborated on different
    framework on the same cloud architecture. SECTION III. Calculation of Water Requirements
    The soil characterization has been achieved on basis of samples taken in situ
    by BNEDER (National Technical Studies Office for Rural Development) located at
    Alger (Algeria). 96 samples were taken following a systematic grid of 30 × 30
    m over the area covered by the pivot (one by layer of soil). The parameters evaluated
    were bulk density, texture and the soil water holding capacity. Then, parameters
    measured on each of the 32 sampling points for three layers of soil has been interpolated
    to obtain a high-resolution map. The software ArcMap 10.5.1 was used to interpolate
    data measured in order to generate a grid by layer of 5m × 5m (25m2 area per cell)
    for each kind of measure. Moreover, each layer of soil has also been interpolate
    using 3D spline method to obtain a 3D model of soil layer. This 3D model and the
    spatial interpolation of soil water holding capacity allows to calculate the plant
    available in function of the depth of rooting. As shown on Fig. 1. The first layer
    is a mix of one or more existing layers which have been homogenized from a textural
    point of view and the salt content by successive plowing on a height of 25 to
    30 cm. The water available for plant is also function of roots development which
    offers the possibility to explore a more and more large part of soil. The available
    water is obtained by a weighted mean of the depth of all layers explored by the
    root system at each stage of development. A day by day amount of water irrigation
    can be calculated from (1). Fig. 1 Different stages of crop development Show All
    The FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and the evapo-transpiration of the crop (ETc), also named MET which takes
    into account the stage of vegetative growth of the crop by weighting the potential
    evapotranspiration by the coefficient Kc [13]. The Kc coefficient allows to modulate
    the PET in function of the crop envisaged and the stage of its stage of development.

    of soil [°C], U 2 is the wind speed at 2m height of soil [m.s-1], e s − e a is
    the saturation vapor pressure [kPa], Δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve
    [kPa.°C-1], γ is the psychrometric constant [kPa.°C-1]. The evapotranspiration
    of the crop is calculated with (3). ETc= PET ∗ Kc (3) View Source Where ETc is
    the crop evapotranspiration [mm.day''], PET is the reference evapotranspiration
    [mm.day−1] and Kc is a ponderation coefficient variating between 0.3 to 1.2 depending
    of the crop stage of development [8], see Fig 1. SECTION IV. Material The application
    is tested on a pivot-center irrigation and a crop of soft wheat implanted in Ain
    Salah located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region in the center of Algeria.
    This region is characterized by a hot desert climate where the temperature in
    the summer reach 47 to 50°C. The irrigation pivot-center is composed of 6 spans
    with a total length of 308m. The revolution time of the pivot is 24h, it means
    that every hour an angle of 15° is traveled. As shown in the Fig. 2, the cover
    area is increasing from the center to the outside. The sensors must stay functional
    with important temperature variation from 20 to 65 degrees and remained functional
    also in presence of rate of humidity close to 80%. Fig. 3 The proposed system
    and architecture Show All SECTION V. Proposed System and Archttecture We have
    chosen to follow the open hardware way as part of our developments. The proposed
    system is composed locally of a weather station. Several multi-depth moisture
    sensors distributed on the irrigate area at the middle on each span measure the
    amount of water at different depths and solenoid placed on sprinkler. Data are
    transmitted by LoRa modulation to a gateway which relay data to The Things Network
    using a 4G connection. A cloud architecture collects, treats and stores data received
    from the weather station and soil moisture sensor, and calculates in real-time
    needs in irrigation water. A. Weather Station The weather data are acquired by
    a micro weather station which uses a LoRa transmission system. This low-cost protocol
    has been chosen for its easiness of deployment, its ability to resist interference
    with the spread spectrum technology and the area that can be covered by a single
    gateway. The micro weather station is based on a Weather Sensor (Argent Data Systems)
    which contains an anemometer, a vane direction and a pluviometer. The weather
    station contains a temperature / humidity sensor AM2315 (Aosong) with an error
    of 0.1°C for the temperature and 2% for the relative humidity. The net solar radiation
    is measured by a digital net radiometer SN-500, Apogee Instruments. All sensors
    are connected on a LoPy which collect data and send them on LoRa / 4G gateway
    (see Fig. 3). B. Sensors and Actuators Soil moisture nodes based on LoPy using
    soil moisture underground sensors measure the rate of humidity at different soil
    depths. The humidity is measured at different depth (20, 30 and 50 cm) with Watermark
    Soil Moisture Irrometer sensor model 200SS. The measure of humidity at different
    depth allow to control if amount of water calculate are correct or if they must
    be adjusted. As show on Fig. 2, the 24 sensors are implanted in the middle of
    each ring, the water requirements are controlled 8 times per day (one just before
    the irrigation and one hour just after the irrigation) on each of the four control
    lines of sensors. Solenoid valves are implanted on the sprinkler feed pipes and
    allows them to be operated individually and thus finely control the water supply.
    The fine control of the sprinklers allows to have a same amount of water per unit
    area at each of the 6 zones traveled at the level of each of the different segments
    each hour. C. Cloud Architecture We use our own architecture based on a Cloud
    IoT platform and a share/hosting application platform. This architecture has already
    been tested with cattle behavior [39], digital phenotyping [40] and monitoring
    of bee health [41]. Time-related Data are transmitted to the Cloud IoT platform
    by LPWA network while images, videos and sound are transmitted by Wi-Fi network,
    see Fig. 3. 1) The Cloud IoT Platform The platform is composed of two parts. The
    first one is based on one hand on Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Druid, to treat
    stream and time-related data. The second one uses an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
    are associate to store and treat images, sound and video. a) Time Related-Data
    Data are received by Apache Kafka which transfer them to Apache Samza to be processed
    before the ingesting by Druid. Druid is a distributed column -oriented fault-tolerant
    data store presenting real-time analytical capabilities. The data processing allows
    to increase the speed of ingestion 10 times by elimination of bad formed package,
    inconsistent and incomplete data. Redis Caching accelerate the speed of recurrent
    queries. The data are stored in units of few millions of lines named ‘segments’
    composed of 5 to 10 million of times-stamped events compressed by LZ4. Old segments
    are locally stored on HDFS. Both external dependencies are used: PostgreSQL and
    ZooKeeper to respectively store meta data and monitor the four kinds of nodes
    present in the cluster. These four types of nodes coordinate, broke, store in
    real-time or archive data in the distributed data store. b) Sound, Images and
    Video These kinds of data are independently treated and stored by a second structure
    based on Hadoop and Apache Spark. These kinds of data are also locally stored
    on HDFS. This structure offers better performance than an Hadoop, MapReduce, HiPi.
    Camera placed on the pivot center can make 3D-pictures of same plant every day
    in order to model their development and compare the impact of agricultural practices
    and weather conditions on the growth of the crop. The analysis of sound allows
    to detect any dysfunction may occur of critical parts of pivot-center and program
    a preventive maintenance (PM) to avoid the immobilization of the pivot over a
    long period. But both features are not yet implemented. 2) The Application Sharing
    and Hosting Platform Druid powers high performances application with low query
    latencies. To better exploit this performance and don''t be dependent of one SDK,
    we propose a cloud architecture able to host application developed on principal
    framework. This cloud platform authorizes elaboration of the model by researchers
    and also host endpoint applications of third party adapted to different kinds
    of material allowing to monitor and automate the pivot-center irrigation while
    optimizing crop yields. SECTION VI. Results We compare water requirements calculated
    by the cloud architecture with the one calculated by CropWat [42] decision support
    tool. This tool is developed by the Land and Water Development Division for the
    calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil,
    climate and crop data. The calculation procedure is described in [8], the response
    of different yield is explained in [43] and the coupling between CropWat and climatic
    data of ClimWat is explicated step by step in [44]. Remarkably values calculated
    by CropWat assume that only water can change and other factors such as agricultural
    practices, fertilization, etc. are at optimal level. Table 1 gives results obtained
    with CropWat 8.0 for a wheat with a planting date of 25 November at In Salah,
    Algeria and total development in 180 days. Water requirements are calculated on
    basis of real daily weather data. Table I. Water requirements calculated with
    cropwat The Fig. 4 shows the comparison between measured and calculated with CropWat
    Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP). Both approach gives similar results. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion and Future Works We have outlined an architecture based on soil
    characteristics interpolate by mean of GIS, soil moisture measured, and weather
    data transmitted by LoRaWan to calculate in quasi real-time the water requirements
    of the crop. The LoRaWan is particularly adapted to transmit data in harsh conditions.
    In the end, the comparison of first approach performed with CropWat has allowed
    to calculate maximal evapotranspiration and verify that these are never exceeded.
    Fig. 4 Comparison between CropWat and measured average daily ETP Show All In order
    to validate the water requirements calculated using the CropWat model, we compared
    them with a precise model called AquaCrop [45]. This model considers more parameters
    affecting the vegetative and reproductive growth of crop. The implementation of
    3D Camera in specific areas places on the pivot, will open a new research path
    in the field of digital phenotyping. In addition to this, the continuous analysis
    of sound from microphones implemented in chosen places will quickly detect signs
    of failure and prevent downtime that can be expensive in term of crop profitability.
    As future work, we plan to exploit GPU Tegra Mobile Processors 1 that offers high
    computation power thanks to the exploitation of GPU processors in parallel [46]
    [47]. In addition to the high performance, these cards provide the possibility
    to exploit artificial intelligence algorithms for a better training and prediction
    of collected data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues from Biosystems

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Vienna, Austria SECTION I. Introduction The
    smart grid, as a cyber-physical critical infrastructures boasts higher reliability.
    efficiency and consumer-centricity in an environ-ment of increasing power demand
    through the effective use of information-namely information about the right thing,
    to the right party, at the right time. The Inter-communicating devices such as
    Phasor Measurement Units (PMU s) and smart meters, have opened exciting opportunities
    [1], in which the acquisition transmission and consumption of high-granularity
    real-time power system data is facilitated through the integration of communications
    computing and advanced control technologies. Such dependence on information technology
    naturally raises questions as to the effects of cyber attacks on power system
    operation [2]–[4]. Furthermore the massive amounts of real-time power system data
    have brought transformative potential and transformative challenges for securing
    the smart grid system [5]. [6]. The attacks targeting availability, integrity
    and confidentiality are identified as the major security issues for monitoring
    and control systems for smart grids [7]–[9]. This paper focuses on one typical
    data integrity attack, false data injection attack. Recent work focused on false
    data injection attacks has demonstrated how an opponent can bias power system
    measurements and overcome residual-based bad data detection approaches [10]. Subsequent
    research has focused on identifying such attacks [11]–[16] and has largely taken
    an information perspective. A detection strategy was proposed in [11] by protecting
    a strategically selected set of sensor measurements and by independently verifying
    the values of a strategically selected set of state variables. [12] introduced
    algorithms that obtains efficient protection and partial protection given a limited
    budget. In [13]. the authors presented the least-effort attack model and formulated
    the attacking strategy that selects a set of meters to manipulate so as to cause
    the maximum damage. The authors also proposed a protection-basea defense scheme
    and a detection-based defense scheme. In [14]. the authors formulated the false
    data detection problem as the matrix separation problem and proposed two protection
    methods, the nuclear norm minimization method and low rank matrix factorization
    method. The authors in [15] proposed two distributed detection algorithms based
    on observable islands theory. In [16]. the equivalent measurement transformation
    and the largest weighted residual method were integrated for detecting the false
    data injection attacks. These techniques were developed based on the assumption
    of stable power systems with fixed topology. Therefore. these methods cannot be
    directly used for detecting the attacks in the large-scale emerging energy systems
    with time-varying topologies. The real-time data from PMUs and smart meters facilitate
    the real-time security assessment of large-scale emerging energy systems. However
    the tremendous amount of data demands the appropriate data analysis and control
    techniques. Recently an unsupervised feature learning technique Deep Be-lief Network
    (DBN). was proposed to build and learn the hier-archical representations from
    the real-time data and capture the higher-order statistical structure of the input
    domain [17]. By doing this. DBNs provide a computationally efficient way to remove
    the manual step and automatically learn features during the training process.
    By realizing automatic feature extraction. DBNs are able to achieve higher efficiency
    and accuracy in recognizing complex pattern compared with the conventional Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) techniques [18]–[23]. While the DBN has shown promise for
    modeling static data in various applications it met challenges in analyzing the
    time-series data and capturing the complex temporal dynamics. In [24]. an extension
    version of DBN. called Conditional DBN (CDBN). was presented to model temporal
    data by treating the previously observed data as additional input and implementing
    autoregressive (AR) data modeling scheme. In this work. we adopt the CDBN-based
    techniques to analyze the sequential PMU data in real time and detect the existence
    of information corruption. In this paper, we study the data integrity issues for
    transient stability of WAMSs and develop a CDBN-based cyber-physical strategy
    with distributed control using real-time data from geographi-cally distributed
    PMU s. The proposed strategy leverages the physical coherence to exploit the hidden
    correlation between the real-time data flows and identify the critical data which
    are vulnerable to malicious attack. Based on the hidden correlation the strategy
    applies the CDBN-based approach to predict the expected features of the critical
    data. which are used to evaluate the trustworthiness of the critical data. In
    the next section we present the problem framework. Section III details the proposed
    attack-mitigation model. Section IV introduces the proposed deep learning-based
    cyber-physical strategy. Simulation results and final remarks are presented in
    Sections V and VI, respectively. SECTION II. Problemsetting The work in this paper
    is built on a two-tier hierarchical cyber-physical multi-agent control framework
    for modeling the transient stability problem of a wide-area power system, which
    was developed in the previous work [25]. The hierarchical framework consists of
    clusters of agents. Each agent consists of: (1) a dynamic node representing a
    power system generator, (2) a PMU that acquires real-time information including
    the rotor angle ( θ i ) and frequency of the associated generator ( ω i ) , (3)
    a local cyber-controller that employs PMU data from select generators to compute
    a control signal that is applied to the local generator of the same agent. In
    the face of a cyber or physical disturbance the agents with the generators exhibit
    high physical coherence form a state-dependent cluster. In [26], a real-time data-driven
    scheme was proposed for identifying the physical coherence between synchronous
    generators. As such, a cluster con-sists of generator agents with high physical
    coherence, a phasor data concentrator (PDC) that represents a PMU communications
    gateway, and a fast-acting energy storage employed by local controllers for system
    stabilization through power injection/absorption at generator buses. The agent
    with the highest inertia generator in a cluster is termed the lead agent while
    the others are referred to as secondary. In the hierarchical framework, the high
    physical coherence between the agents belonging to the same cluster enables to
    only acquire the PMU measurements provided by the lead agents for ensuring transient
    system stabilization in the face of a disturbance. SECTION III. Attack-Mitigation
    Model According to the hierarchical cyber-physical control framework, the real-time
    measurements provided by the PMUs of the lead agents are identified as critical
    data and detection of possible data integrity attacks on lead PMU data and subsequent
    real-time estimation are necessary for transient stability maintenance. In order
    to address this problem, we specify the following threat model for the attackers:
    The attacker has knowledge of the power system topology and initial state of the
    system prior to attack. The attacker is capable of corrupting up to ⌊ 1 2 N k
    ⌋ PMU measurements, where [.] denotes the floor function. The attacker cannot
    compromise the Phaser Data Concentrator (PDC). Assumption 1 credits the attacker
    with power system topology information that maybe gleaned through eavesdropping
    of local communications [27], [28]. Assumption 2 is consistent with the fact that
    the attacker attempts to carry out the attack with the limited cost [27], [29].
    Furthermore, the corruption can be completed through biasing PMU readings or equivalently
    replacing true values with fabricated quantities. Assumption 3 requires the PDC
    has efficient attack detection and defense mechanisms [30]. SECTION IV. Deep Learning-Based
    Cyber-Physical Strategy The high physical coherence between the agents within
    a cluster insinuates the large correlation between the PMU measurements from the
    secondary agents and the one from their associated lead agent. Therefore, it is
    reasonable to estimate the PMU measurement of the ith secondary agent, ( θ i (t),
    ω i (t)) , as a “noisy” version of that of its Lead Agent k , which is formulated
    as follows: { ω ^ i (t)= ω k (t)+ ϵ i , θ i ^ (t)= θ k (t)+△ θ ik +ξi, (1) View
    Source where △ θ ik denotes the phase angle difference between the ith and kth
    agents in the static (pre-fault) state, and ∈i∼N(θ,μ) and ξ i ∼N(θ,σ) are zero-rnean
    Gaussian random variables with μ≪1 and σ≪1 . Based on Eq. (1), the PMU data from
    the lead agents can be vali-.ate. using the PMU data from the secondary agents.
    As illustrated in Fig. 1, the PDC works as an aggregator in the intra-cluster
    LAN to verify the trustworthiness of the lead agent''s PMU data and if needed,
    estimate the true value via communicating with secondary agent''s PMU s. The PDC
    probes the PMU data from all of the N k Secondary agents at a veridcation rate,
    v for learning the features of the PMU data of the cluster of agents and thus
    predicting the behavior pattern of the associated lead agent. The PDC also probes
    the lead agent''s data at the same rate for veridcation. A key step in pattern
    recognition is to select a proper set of features with which the input data will
    be presented. In this work, the features are. defined. as the rotor angles and
    speeds at the current time step and the changes of the speeds between the current
    and previous time step. With the feature selection, at a rate of v Hz, the PDC
    forms unlabeled three-dimensional training data x i t ={ θ i (t), ω i (t), δ i
    (t)} , where δ i (t)= ω i (t)− ω i (t−ri),t≥( t 0 +Mk) t 0 is the time when physical
    disturbances are cleared, ri=1/ν,M is a positive integer, and i=1 is the reordered
    index of the lead agent of the kth cluster and i=2,…,( N k +1) denotes the reordered
    index of the secondary agent in the same cluster. To predict the behavior pattern
    of the lead agent we also consider the sequential data observed at previous time
    window with the length of M, x i <t ={ x i t−κ , x i t−2κ ,…, x i t−Wκ } . The
    sequential data x i ={ x i t , x i <t }from in.ivi.ual Agent i are fed consecutively
    into two Conditional Deep Belief Networks (CDBNs) with identical structure, as
    illuminated in Table I. through a preprocessing procedure. Considering that the
    3-dimensional input data have real values, both of the CDBNs are trained by stacking
    one conditional Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GBRBMs) [31]
    [32] (for the first hidden layer) with three conditional Binary RBMs (BRBMs) (for
    the other three hidden layers) as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 1. Communication between
    PDC and agents locally within a cluster Show All The conditional G BRBM used for
    training the first hidden layer employs energy function as follows: E( x i t ,
    h 1 t ) = ∑ j=1 3 [ x i t (j)− a j,t ] 2 2 σ 2 j − ∑ k=1 3 b k,t h 1 t (k) − ∑

    rnatrix, j,t is the dynamic bias associated with the jth input union by considering
    the effect of the past observation x i <t on the current input data, and b k,t
    is the dynamic bias associated with the kth hidden union by considering the effect
    of the past observation x i <t on the hidden layer. a j,t and b k,t can be calculated
    as: { a j,t = a j + ∑ 3M l=1 A lj x i <t (l) b j,t = b j + ∑ 3M l=1 B lj x i <t

    consisting of autoregressive parameters, and B is a matrix composed of the “historical
    observation to hidden” parameters. Based on Eq. (2). the conditional probability
    distributions can be represented as: { p( x i t (j)| h 1 t , x i <t )=N( a j,t
    + σ j ∑ 3 k=1 W jk h 1 t (k), σ 2 j ), p( h 1 t (k)=1| x i )=sigm( b k,t + ∑ 3

    function, and σ j is the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise for the j th

    ∑ k=1 3 W jk h γ−1 t (j) h γ t (k) − ∑ j=1 3 α j,t h γ−1 t (j)− ∑ k=1 3 b k,t
    h γ t (k), (5) View Source where the dynamic biases α j,t and b k,t can be calculated
    by using Eq. (3). Therefore, the Conditional probability distributions can be
    obtained as follows: { p( h γ−1 t (j)=1| h γ f , h γ−1 <f )⇒sigm( ι j,t + ∑ 3
    k=1 W jk h γ f (k)), p( h γ t (k)=1| h γ−1 t , h γ−1 <t )=sigm( b k,t + ∑ 3 j=1
    W ? k h γ t 1(j)). (6) View Source In order to mitigate the false data injection
    attack, we make a small modification to the learning behavior of the Hidden Layer
    4 in Fig. 2. Instead of using the stochastically chosen binary value as the activation
    value of the single Hidden union, we design this Hidden layer to output both the
    binary value and the expected value. The details of the attack detection and defense
    strategy is described in Table II. Table I Two CDBNs used for detecting false
    data injection attack SECTION V. Simulations In this section, we demonstrate our
    proposed deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy and evaluate its performance
    on the 39-bus New England test system of Fig. 3 employing MATLAB/Simulink. We
    consider that a 3-phase short circuit occurs in the middle of Line 14–15 at t=0s
    and then the fault is cleared at time t=0.1s by removing Line 14–15. Furthermore,
    the PMU sampling rate is assigned as 50 Hz, and the verification rate ν=5 Hz.

    of the input 3-dimensional data x i t observed at the current time, h m t (j)
    is the activation value of the jth unit in the mth hidden layer, which is achieved
    by using x i , and h m <t is the vector consisting of the activation values of
    the mth hidden layer, which is achieved by using X i <t . Show All Table II PROPOSED
    deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy Fig. 3. New england 39-bus power system.
    Show All Fig. 4 shows the normalized rotor frequencies and the phase angles achieved
    over a period of 10 s when no control is applied. Instability is clearly evident.
    The hierarchical multi-agent control scheme proposed in [25] is activated at t=0.15s
    . By using the control scheme, the agents with high coherency are grouped into
    three clusters: C1 = {Agent 1}. C2 = {Agent 2, Agent 3}. and C3 = {Agent 4, Agent
    5, Agent 6, …, Agent 10}. The lead agents, selected as having the highest inertia
    generator for each cluster, are given by: Agents 1, 3 and 10. Figure 5 shows the
    normalized rotor frequencies and phase angles in the presence of “random” false
    data injection attack when no deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy is applied.
    The attack specifically consists of PMU corruption of Agents 4, 9 and 10 at time
    t=0.5s for duration 5 s, 7 s. 8 s with random biases generated using the uniform
    distribution U[− 360 ∘ , 360 ∘ ] , respectively. From Fig. 5. it is clear that,
    although the control strategy is activated. the corrupted PMU data mislead the
    PDC of the 3rd cluster and result in the subsequent failure of the stability maintenance.
    To demonstrate our proposed strategy, we select the previous time window as M=9
    . By implementing the deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy stated in Table
    II, we can identify the feature values of the PMU data of the secondary agents
    belonging to the cluster c 3 as: { f i 2,b , f i 2,r } i=2 ={{0,0.2533},{0,0.2534},{0,0.2534},
    {0,0.2532}}{1,0.2545},{0,0.2537}} View Source We can also identity the teature
    value of PMU data of Agent 4. which is the lead agent of cluster c 3 . as { f
    1,b , f 1,r }={1,0.2549} . As stated in Table II, by grouping the secondary agents
    into two classes based on their PMU data''s feature values we can achieve C 1
    ={5,6,7,8,10} and C 2 ={9} . Since | C 1 |>| C 2 . the expected feature of the
    PMU data of Agent 4 is f 1,e =0 that is not equal to the actual feature value
    f 1,b =1 . Therefore, we conclude that there is attack on the lead agent. By measuring
    the reputation of Secondary Agent i belonging to cluster c 3 . where i∈ C 1 .
    we select Secondary Agent 8 to estimate the true values of the attacked lead agent''s
    PMU readings. Figure 6 shows the normalized rotor frequencies and phase angles
    when our proposed cyber-physical strategy is applied. We would like to mention
    that in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy the same random
    biases are employed for the simulations in Figs. 5 and 6. From Fig. 6. we observe
    the stabilizing performance of our proposed strategy in verifying the validity
    of the readings of the lead agents'' PMUs and estimating their true values. Transient
    stability is still maintained in the presence of the random attack. Fig. 4. Normalized
    rotor frequencies and phase angles versus time without active control and proposed
    deen learning-based cyber-physical strategy. Show All We consider another situation
    when the compromised PMUs of Agents 4, 9 and 10. collude and report the same phase
    angle measurement θ i (t)= θ 1 (t)+ 180 ∘ , where i=4,9,10 , starting at t=0.5s
    for duration 7 s. Figure 7 shows the normalized rotor frequencies and phase angles
    without using the proposed deep learning-based cyber-physical strategy. From Fig.
    7, we can observe that the corrupted PMU data disable the control framework to
    maintain the transient stability of the power system. We implement the deep learning-based
    cyber-physical strategy stated in Table II and select the previous time window
    as M=9 . The proposed strategy identifies the feature values of the PMU data of
    the secondary agents belonging to the cluster c 3 as: { f i 2 ⟩ b , f i 2,r }
    i=2 ={{0,0.2653},{0,0.2659},{0,0.2659}, {0,0.2660},{1,0.2679},{1,0.2674}} View
    Source We can also identify the feature value of the PMU data of Agent 4. which
    is the lead agent of cluster c 3 . as { f 1,b , f 1,r }={1,0.2683} . As stated
    in Table II, by grouping the secondary agents into two classes based on their
    PMU data s feature values we can achieve C 1 ={5,6,7,8} and C 2 ={9,10} . Since
    | C 1 |>| C 2 | . the expected feature of the PMU data of Agent 4 is f 1,e =0
    that is not equal to the actual feature value f 1,b =1 . Therefore, we conclude
    that there is attack on the lead agent. By measuring the reputation of Secondary
    Agent i in cluster c 3 , where i∈ c 1 . we use the PMU rneasurernents of Secondary
    Agents 6 and 7 to estimate the true values of the lead agent''s PMU readings.
    Figure 8 shows the normalized rotor frequencies and phase angles when our proposed
    cyber-physical strategy is applied. We observe the stabilizing performance of
    our proposed strategy in verifying the validity of the lead agents'' PMU data
    and estimating their true values. Transient stability is still maintained in the
    presence of this type of collusion since the number of corrupted PMU measurements
    ℓ=3 is less than or equal to ⌊ 1 2 N 3 ⌋ ‘ where N 3 =7 which obeys our attack-mitigation

    of a deep learning-base. cyber-physical strategy to detect and defend against
    the poten-tial false. ata injection attack on the critical. ata for the application
    of maintaining the transient stability of WAMS in real time. The proposed cyber-physical
    protection framework addresses both cyber (e. g., information corruption) and
    physical (e. g., faults and their latent clearing) disruptions. Simulations on
    the 39-bus New England test system demonstrate the potential of the proposed strategy.

    efficient. The system via dual-line decoding technology, and a variety of sensors
    were used to collect the parameters of crop growth environment for each individual
    protected agriculture in real-time. Then all kinds of collected data were timely
    transmitted and stored in cloud data management platform. Thereafter, the ability
    of calculation and analysis from cloud calculated cluster was used, water and
    fertilizer needs, irrigation and fertilization system in protected agriculture
    under different environmental conditions for crop growth were scientifically determined
    to achieve intelligent control of water and fertilizer integration. The system
    was of great importance in guiding protected agriculture to achieve high yield,
    high quality, ecology and safety in production. Two application examples in planting
    bases of protected agriculture showed that compared with the traditional irrigation
    methods, the intelligent cloud irrigation system based on the technology of dual-line
    decoding and cloud computing to manage integrated water and fertilizer for protected
    agriculture can improve the water use efficiency by 25%~40% and fertilizer use
    efficiency by 15%~35%, which shortened labor time and decreased labor force sharply.

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction In the western US, substantial year-to-year variability
    in weather conditions complicates planning for water managers and agricultural
    producers, and makes it difficult to apply standard rule-of-thumb approaches to
    agricultural water management. In California, the recent three year drought, from
    2007–2009, underscored the vulnerability of the state''s agricultural industry
    to variability in water supply, with hundreds of millions in economic losses and
    thousands of agricultural jobs lost [1]. Concurrent with the drought, groundwater
    levels in the Central Valley declined substantially [2] as growers pumped water
    to partially offset reductions in surface water deliveries. Inter-annual variability
    in water supply is common throughout the western U.S., where growing urban populations,
    increases in water allocations for endangered species, and climate change—with
    predicted shifts in precipitation and reductions in winter snowpack in the Sierra
    and Rocky Mountains [3]–[5]— will continue to constrain water supplies for agricultural
    users. Because agriculture is typically the largest user of water in the West,
    maximizing the benefits of available agricultural water supplies is central to
    the implementation of drought mitigation and climate adaptation strategies in
    western states. Low cost adaptation strategies for agricultural water users include
    the use of irrigation scheduling technologies that incorporate information on
    weather conditions and crop growth stage. Satellite measurements of water resources
    and hydrologic fluxes have great potential for supporting agricultural producers
    and water managers working to optimize agricultural water supply and use. When
    combined with biophysical models, satellite observations can be applied to scale
    point observations from surface observation networks across larger geographic
    areas. Evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture data are particularly relevant
    to both operational water management and long-term planning. Surface measurements
    of these parameters are often difficult and expensive to collect, and generally
    available only from sparsely distributed observation networks. Recent advances
    in modeling and measurement of ET using satellite observations now enable moderate
    resolution (30–1000m), spatially continuous estimates of ET over large areas in
    near real-time [6]–[9]. Integration of this information into current water management
    practices and operational models, however, requires the development of frameworks
    for synthesizing data from multiple sensor networks to drive models for estimating
    evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and other key hydrologic reservoirs and fluxes.
    New approaches are also required for delivery of satellite-derived data and information
    products to water managers and agricultural producers. Table I Summary of Key
    Terms and Abbreviations One water management challenge where integration of ET
    models and sensor network observations has immediate potential utility is in supporting
    agricultural producers and water managers working to optimize irrigation management
    by accounting for current weather and crop conditions when making irrigation management
    decisions. In scheduling irrigation, growers must account for multiple factors,
    including soil type, salinity and leaching fraction, weather conditions and crop
    growth stage. In water limited regions, it is particularly important for growers
    to maximize on-farm water use efficiency by accounting for weather conditions
    in estimating crop water consumption and associated irrigation demand. A common
    method of irrigation scheduling involves estimation of crop water use by multiplying
    weather-based estimates of reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) by crop coefficients
    ( K c ) for a particular crop. (A summary of key terms and definitions related
    to agricultural irrigation management is included in Table I.) ET o is defined
    as the evapotranspiration from a reference crop, typically a well-watered, actively
    growing grass or alfalfa of uniform height. In the western U.S., agricultural
    weather networks such as the California Irrigation Management Information System
    (CIMIS), AgriMet, and the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET) provide hourly
    information on weather conditions and ET o . Within California, CIMIS [10] currently
    operates 139 stations across the state and provides data to growers and irrigation
    consultants on ET o and weather conditions. Spatial CIMIS daily ET o data derived
    using the methods developed by Hart et al. [11] are available from 2003 to present
    at 2km spatial resolution statewide. The method uses cloud cover estimates derived
    from the GOES weather satellites to estimate the daily solar insolation for each
    pixel, and thus represents an initial integration of satellite and surface observations
    within CIMIS. Guideline crop coefficients have been compiled for several crops
    and are available from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization Irrigation
    and Drainage Paper 56, commonly known as FAO-56 [12], the University of California''s
    Basic Irrigation Scheduler, the California Department of Water Resources'' Consumptive
    Use Program, and the Wateright system developed by California State University,
    Fresno. K c is a dimensionless value representing typical crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) for a given crop canopy relative to ET o , and it captures the effect
    of crop growth stage on evaporative demand. K c integrates the effects of both
    crop transpiration and soil evaporation. Many growers use a dual-crop coefficient
    approach, which separates the evaporation and transpiration components of ET.
    The basal crop coefficient ( K cb ) represents conditions for an unstressed crop
    on a dry soil surface, and a separate coefficient is used to calculate soil evaporation
    ( K e ) if required. K cb can be used to calculate basal crop ET ( ET cb ) as
    a measure of plant transpiration for a non-stressed crop plus a small diffusive
    soil evaporation component. As such, ET cb also provides a measure of potential
    crop water use, or biological water demand for well-watered crops. While useful
    for seasonal planning, one limitation of this standard approach to operational
    irrigation management is that it requires growers to derive crop coefficients
    from look-up tables and then correct them for site-specific conditions. In addition,
    many crop coefficients were developed decades ago and may not account for current
    farming practices or local and interannual variability in weather conditions and
    crop development rates. Previous research conducted in California quantified the
    observed benefits of using information on ET in irrigation scheduling. This research
    compared applied irrigation and yields reported by growers on 55 farms before
    and after use of ET o data from CIMIS. Results from the study reported an average
    increase in yields of 8%, and a reduction in total applied irrigation of 13% [13],
    [14]. While it is difficult to fully control for the effect of year-to-year variability
    in weather on crop yields in these types of studies, this result suggests that
    during key phases in crop development, some growers may be irrigating to the point
    that the root zone becomes saturated, reducing oxygen availability in the root
    zone and modestly suppressing crop growth. Across the 13 different crop types
    evaluated, including tree and vine crops, vegetable crops, and field crops, growers
    reported total economic benefits from increased yields and reductions in applied
    water ranging from 110to 1,700 per hectare. Due in part to these benefits, use
    of CIMIS data in California has grown from about 450 primary registered CIMIS
    data users in 1987, to nearly 40,000 today. In the year 2010 alone, for example,
    ∼2million reports were generated from the CIMIS database. However, the most recent
    farm and ranch irrigation survey conducted by the USDA indicated that only 12%
    of growers in California utilize reports on daily crop-water ET in scheduling
    irrigation [15], due in part to the barriers described above. Development of an
    automated system for mapping crop coefficients and delivery of data to users would
    enhance the use of ET data in irrigation management. The California Department
    of Water Resources (CDWR) identified statewide mapping of crop coefficients in
    near-real-time as one of the high priority, short term needs for CIMIS [16]. In
    addition to ET o , observations of other parameters related to agricultural water
    management are increasingly available from surface sensor networks and satellites.
    Soil moisture information is available for a limited number of sites from the
    USDA Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). As the cost of soil moisture sensors
    has declined, an increasing number of specialty crop producers are also deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks in their operations. Satellite and aircraft remote
    sensing observations of crop canopies over agricultural regions are used by the
    USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to map crop types and fallowed
    acreage on an annual, post-season basis, and increasingly by individual growers
    to identify and map variations in crop canopy conditions that may be indicative
    of pest infestations, variations in soil texture, or irregularities in irrigation
    systems. Seasonal estimates of evapotranspiration from satellite-driven energy
    balance models such as the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) [17]
    and the Mapping EvapoTRanspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [18]
    model have also been used by water managers for water rights accounting to resolve
    disputes over water resources [19]. Integration of these data sources into current
    management practices and operational models presents a number of challenges, especially
    for applications that require information in near real-time. In addition to typical
    issues associated with processing large volumes of data from heterogeneous sources,
    data from the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensors
    onboard the Landsat satellites must be atmospherically corrected to minimize artificial
    scene-to-scene variability resulting from the effects of aerosols, ozone, and
    water vapor. A hardware failure on the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument produces regularly
    spaced data gaps that must be addressed. Differences in the spatial scale of different
    satellite sensors must be considered when fusing data from sensors such as Landsat
    TM and ETM+ (30 m–120 m) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) (250 m–1 km) to reduce data gaps due to clouds and improve data reliability.
    Data from surface sensor networks are valuable for calibrating and scaling satellite-driven
    models, but they must be retrieved and transformed into formats that can be ingested
    by various models. At present, a number of satellite-driven energy balance models
    (including SEBAL and METRIC) for estimation of ET also require manual intervention
    to select “cold” and “hot” anchor pixels that serve to constrain the calculation
    of ET, making it difficult to fully automate operation of these models, though
    work by Kjaersgaard et al. [20] shows progress towards resolving this problem.
    As a result of these issues, the full potential of satellite data for supporting
    water managers and agricultural producers has yet to be fully realized. The NASA
    Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) [21] provides a modeling
    and computing framework for integrating satellite and surface observations in
    near real-time to address many of the challenges described above. In the following
    sections, we describe an application of the TOPS framework to develop a system
    for near real-time mapping of crop canopy conditions and associated crop irrigation
    requirements at the resolution of individual fields. To support continued improvements
    in management of agricultural water supplies, the data processing system is designed
    to provide growers and water managers with frequent, accurate, and easily available
    information that includes key indicators of crop canopy development and crop water
    use requirements. SECTION II. A Framework for Satellite Irrigation Management
    Support Fig. 1. Overview of the TOPS-SIMS architecture with primary data inputs
    and outputs. Show All The TOPS Satellite Irrigation Management Support (TOPS-SIMS)
    framework integrates satellite observations from Landsat and MODIS with meteorological
    observations from CIMIS and ancillary data on crop type and site specific conditions
    (Fig. 1). The system employs a modular architecture to facilitate support for
    a wide range of models and data. The initial implementation provides a capability
    for mapping of fractional cover ( F c ) , associated basal crop coefficients (
    K cb ) , and evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) over 3.7 million ha of farmland in California''s
    Central Valley. F c and K cb are mapped every eight days, and ET cb maps are produced
    on a daily basis at spatial resolutions that are useful for irrigation management
    at the field level (30 m). Automated atmospheric correction and gap-filling algorithms
    are optimized for agricultural areas to provide a robust and reliable data stream.
    Information from TOPS-SIMS is distributed to water managers and agricultural producers
    via a browser-based irrigation management decision support system. Users may combine
    the supplied K cb or ET cb with formal or intuitive estimates of soil evaporation
    to derive total water consumption over the recent period at the field level. By
    accounting for the irrigation application rate, distribution uniformity, and any
    corrections for water replacement targets (e.g., intentional deficit irrigation
    or leaching requirement), users can translate TOPS-SIMS output into an irrigation
    management strategy. To evaluate the utility of the system for commercial farming
    operations, TOPS-SIMS estimates are compared against ET data collected by surface
    renewal stations [22] and information from wireless soil moisture sensor networks
    deployed in operational agricultural fields across California in cooperation with
    growers. The TOPS-SIMS architecture facilitates forecasting of potential consumptive
    use and associated irrigation demand with lead times of up to 1 week through integration
    of forecast data from the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted Reference
    Evapotranspiration system (FRET). This capability is particularly relevant for
    future extension of TOPS-SIMS to support both irrigation scheduling and water
    delivery planning. Finally, the TOPS-SIMS architecture is designed to support
    the future addition of other satellite-driven models for estimation of ET, soil
    moisture, and crop stress, all of which further the goal of improving water management
    and making irrigation scheduling more practical, convenient, and accurate. SECTION
    III. Methods TOPS, a NASA modeling and data assimilation framework developed to
    monitor and forecast environmental conditions, provides a range of capabilities
    for integrating observations from satellites and surface sensor networks via models
    including crop models, biogeochemical and carbon cycle models, ecological models,
    and numerical weather and climate models [21]. The TOPS framework has also been
    adapted to run on high-end computing resources in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing
    (NAS) facility as part of the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) [23]. NEX combines supercomputing
    resources, Earth system modeling, remote sensing data from NASA and other agencies,
    and a scientific social networking platform to deliver a complete work environment
    in which users can analyze large Earth science data sets, run modeling codes,
    collaborate on new or existing projects, and share results within and among communities.
    NEX provides direct access to the full archive of Landsat and MODIS data for the
    western U.S., as well as on-demand access to thousands of processing cores, facilitating
    rapid processing of both historic data archives and incoming satellite data. Leveraging
    these capabilities, TOPS-SIMS ingests Landsat-5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ , and MODIS
    satellite imagery for California''s Central Valley and other agricultural regions.
    Landsat provides the spatial resolution necessary to produce information at the
    scale of individual fields. The daily temporal resolution of MODIS provides a
    gap-filling capability to ensure data availability. Methods employed by the remote
    sensing community for satellite mapping of ET at field scales (30 m) rely primarily
    on energy balance models, e.g., [17], [18], [24], or reflectance-based mapping
    of crop coefficients, e.g., [25]–[28]; see also review by Gowda et al. [29]. Of
    these approaches, strategies for full automation at the scale of individual fields
    have only been developed for mapping of crop coefficients from surface reflectance,
    and thus the initial suite of algorithms implemented in the TOPS-SIMS framework
    relies on this approach. In the future, it may be possible to implement additional
    models, including energy balance models and models for downscaling of soil moisture
    estimates from satellite missions such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
    mission. Each Landsat scene is atmospherically corrected using software developed
    under the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project
    [30]. LEDAPS incorporates the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer modeling approach
    of Vermote et al. [31], as included in the standard MODIS data processing chain.
    Landsat TM and ETM+ data are tiled onto a common grid to form an 8-day composite.
    This facilitates use of overlapping portions of each scene to increase the frequency
    of observations and reduce data gaps due to cloud cover. This compositing approach
    also reduces the effects of the ETM+ scan line correction error, as only the central
    portion of the Landsat 7 scenes are used, where the gaps are narrower. The next
    step is to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [32] from
    the composited Landsat scenes. NDVI is an index calculated from the red and near
    infrared wavelengths and provides a measure of photosynthetic capacity. At this
    stage, a suite of gap-filling algorithms are employed to ensure spatially continuous
    data over agricultural regions. Current algorithms include the use of moving window
    averages and linear interpolation to fill small data gaps over agricultural fields.
    Field boundaries available from many of the County Agricultural Commissioners''
    offices in California facilitate identification of MODIS 250 m NDVI pixels that
    are fully contained within agricultural field boundaries, and thus enable use
    of MODIS data to fill the majority of the remaining data gaps with reasonable
    accuracy. Use of the STAR-FM algorithm [33], as implemented within TOPS, can be
    employed to address any remaining gaps through fusion of Landsat and MODIS by
    disaggregating MODIS data to the Landsat scale. Prior to further processing, non-agricultural
    areas are masked out using the USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL)1 [34] and field
    polygons from local County Agricultural Commissioner offices, when available.
    The CDL is also used to spatially differentiate annual crops from perennial orchards
    and vineyards. Following the compositing and gap-filling procedures, NDVI data
    are transformed to F c via empirical relationships developed by USDA and NASA.
    Johnson and Trout [35] and Trout et al. [36] collected field measurements of F
    c across multiple crop types in the Central Valley. These data were compared with
    satellite observations collected on the same day, and revealed a robust relationship
    between NDVI and F c (Fig. 2(a)). This approach is consistent with previous studies
    showing that various spectral vegetation indices, calculated from visible and
    near-infrared (NIR) reflectance data, are linearly related to canopy light interception
    [37]–[39]. To convert F c to K cb , TOPS-SIMS uses different approaches for retrospective
    versus near real-time mapping of K cb . For retrospective mapping of annual crops
    or for fields where information on the current crop type is available from the
    grower, F c is converted to K cb based on a physical description of the crop canopy
    [40]. A density coefficient ( K d ) , based on F c and estimated plant height,
    is calculated first to link increases in the crop coefficient with increasing
    vegetation amount. K d is then used to interpolate between the minimum and maximum
    K cb for a given crop type, as listed in FAO-56. Using methods described by Fig.
    2. Past studies conducted by USDA in collaboration with NASA [35], [36] provide
    the basis for linking NDVI to fractional cover using relationships that are robust
    across different crop types and canopy architectures ( R 2 =0.97) (a). In (b),
    use of a generalized equation (after methods of Allen and Pereira [40]) for converting
    fractional cover to FAO crop coefficients provides a robust approach for mapping
    K cb values for annual crops ( R 2 =0.90) . When the crop type at a particular
    location is specified or can be identified with confidence, crop specific equations
    may also be applied. Show All Allen and Pereira [40], a crop specific F c − K
    cb conversion can be applied retrospectively to a given field based on the CDL
    crop classification or information provided by the grower or farm manager. The
    CDL is not publicly available until after December 31 of each year, however, presenting
    a challenge for near real-time mapping of K cb using this approach. While the
    crop type for perennial fields (vineyards, orchards) can be reasonably determined
    from prior-year maps, the spatial distribution of annuals, such as lettuce, tomato,
    or cotton, is generally unknown within-season due to the complex and diverse nature
    of the agricultural cropping patterns throughout much of California. A generalized
    F c − K cb relationship representing a best-fit to crop specific relationships
    (Fig. 2(b)) is thus applied for near real-time mapping of fields deemed by CDL
    to contain annual crops. Use of this approach introduces K cb mean estimation
    uncertainty ranging from 3–14% across the major crop categories (vegetables, roots/tubers,
    legumes, fibers, oils, cereals). For perennial crops, results from multi-year
    studies recently performed on large weighing lysimeters at the University of California
    Kearney Agricultural Center are used for F c − K cb conversion [41], [42]. Both
    studies reported a strong relationship between mid-day canopy light interception,
    which is closely related to F c , and the crop coefficient. Finally, ET cb for
    both annuals and perennials is calculated as the product of K cb and ET o . For
    California, ET o is retrieved by TOPS-SIMS via FTP (file transfer protocol) from
    the standard Spatial CIMIS 2 km daily statewide ET o grids. Fig. 3. Examples of
    comparisons between profiles from TOPS-SIMS using generalized (solid blue line)
    and crop-specific (dashed blue line) relationships versus FAO-56 [12] (solid green
    line) for various crops during 2011. The comparisons highlight the ability of
    TOPS-SIMS to modify the idealized FAO-56 for observed crop cover and phenology
    as related to site-specific management practices and local weather conditions.
    Show All TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of deriving crop coefficients for estimating
    ET cb using an automated data integration and processing system, fully independent
    of contemporaneous crop type classification, and provides a framework for assimilating
    other sensor network observations and models to provide information on crop canopy
    conditions and ET. Crop coefficient values from the fully automated TOPS-SIMS
    compare well with crop coefficients derived from FAO-56 planning guidelines during
    initial growth and at near full cover, but can deviate during vegetative growth
    and maturation. Comparisons for individual fields highlight differences due to
    agronomic practices and crop response to site-specific weather conditions (Fig.
    3). For example, the seasonal profiles for tomatoes and cotton closely match the
    FAO-56 profiles when using a crop-specific formula to convert F c to K cb , while
    lettuce and watermelon were better characterized by the generalized F c − K cb
    conversion. Corn and wheat observations reveal different development rates and
    overall phenological progression than those of FAO. Johnson and Melton [43] also
    compared TOPS-SIMS ET cb estimates against ET c values from SEBAL, which employs
    a more complex energy-balance approach. SEBAL has been widely used to model ET
    over agricultural regions, but requires a highly trained analyst to manually perform
    the required calibrations and operate the model. TOPS-SIMS ET cb values compared
    favorably with SEBAL ET a estimates for unstressed crops for representative San
    Joaquin Valley crop types, with mean differences ranging from 0.4 to 0.85 mm/day
    (Fig. 4). SECTION IV. Integrating Satellite and Surface Sensor Networks With ET
    Models Automated integration of satellite observations of crop canopy development
    with surface observations of ET o is an important first step in developing a fully
    integrated sensor network or “system of systems” capable of providing estimates
    of ET and soil moisture derived from multiple data sources to water managers and
    agricultural producers. Integration of soil moisture observations from soil moisture
    sensor networks installed in agricultural fields is an important additional advance,
    as soil moisture observations can provide operational users with an independent
    check on a water balance derived from satellite ET cb estimates and field-specific
    irrigation and weather records. Integration of soil moisture data also provides
    a mechanism for future automation of model calibration to account for intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower. It is cost prohibitive to collect soil moisture
    observations across an entire field, but selective use of soil moisture sensors
    can increase confidence in satellite-derived estimates and facilitate use of satellite
    data to scale information derived from soil moisture observations over larger
    areas. Fig. 4. Comparison of daily water use estimates (mm) for unstressed San
    Joaquin Valley fields generated by two satellite-driven models (from Johnson and
    Melton [43]). Actual evapotranspiration ( ET a ) generated using the SEBAL surface
    energy balance approach. Basal evapotranspiration ( ET cb ) generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Mean absolute error (MAE) in mm/day was calculated as a measure of model agreement,
    as shown. All dates 2009. Show All The cost of soil moisture sensors and wireless
    data loggers has declined substantially over the past decade, and there are now
    a number of commercially available options for growers interested in deploying
    soil moisture sensor networks. In addition, new cost effective techniques have
    been developed for measuring actual ET ( ET a ) in agricultural environments characterized
    by fields on the order of 10–40 hectares. While techniques such as the surface
    renewal approach [22] are still too expensive and complex for use by commercial
    farms growing specialty crops, field instrumentation has now become more cost
    effective, such that multiple sites can be monitored by water management agencies
    or small research teams providing important reference and validation data. To
    assist in understanding relationships between satellite estimates of ET cb and
    surface observations of ET a and soil moisture, we deployed soil moisture sensor
    webs on 12 commercial farms in the Central and Salinas Valleys, in research fields
    located at California State University Fresno in Fresno, CA, and at the University
    of California West Side Research and Extension Center in Five Points, CA. Sensors
    deployed included capacitance probes for volumentric soil water content measurement,
    soil water potential sensors, passive capillary lysimeters for measuring deep
    drainage, in-line flow meters for measuring total applied irrigation, aboveground
    pheno-cams (which record digital images of the field once per day), and meteorological
    stations. In collaboration with CDWR, we also deployed and operated above-ground
    surface renewal stations at seven sites in a range of crops to provide measurements
    of each component of the surface energy balance, facilitating calculation of ET
    a for each site. In surface renewal analysis, ET is calculated as the residual
    of a surface energy balance equation using measured net radiation, ground heat
    flux, and high-frequency measurements of air temperature [22]. These temperature
    traces exhibit low-frequency ramp-like structures which are used to calculate
    sensible heat flux. Surface renewal makes no assumptions regarding atmospheric
    stability, and is here combined with sonic anemometer data to account for unequal
    heating of air parcels across heterogeneous landscapes [44]. Integration of data
    from these sources has clear value for understanding spatial and temporal patterns
    in ET and soil moisture. Integration of satellite derived ET cb data with observations
    of volumetric soil water content and soil water potential has particular value
    for optimization of irrigation scheduling. Fig. 5(a) provides an example for a
    sub-surface drip irrigated cotton field located near Huron, CA. The satellite
    data provides information on the day-to-day crop water use under well-watered
    conditions, while the soil moisture sensors assist in identifying the onset of
    water stress and magnitude of deficit irrigation. The net water balance, or change
    in total estimated soil water content ( SWC e ) , is calculated as: Δ SWC e =P+I−D−
    ET cb View Source Fig. 5. To illustrate the benefits of integrating satellite
    estimates of ET cb with soil moisture measurements from surface sensor networks,
    measures of ET and soil moisture from different sources are plotted for a cotton
    field near Five Points, CA. Cumulative TOPS-SIMS ET cb (green line), combined
    total irrigation and precipitation (light-blue dashed line), net water balance
    (dark-blue dotted line), and observed volumetric soil water content (VWC, brown
    line) are plotted together in (a). On June 8, daily ET cb begins to exceed daily
    precipitation and applied irrigation as indicated by the negative slope of the
    net water balance line. By July 4 the cumulative water balance turns negative
    (indicating potential onset of plant water stress), and deficit irrigation is
    sustained through August. In (b), incorporation of a crop stress coefficient (
    K s ) of 0.85 to account for soil water limitations on plant transpiration from
    July 4 onward (solid green line) substantially improves agreement between ET cb
    estimates from TOPS-SIMS (dashed green line) and ET a measurements from a surface
    renewal station located in the field (solid dark-blue line). Show All where P
    is precipitation in mm measured by the on-site weather station; I is irrigation
    in mm, calculated as the average flow measured in two drip laterals and divided
    by effective irrigated area; D is drainage below the rooting zone measured with
    a Gee capillary lysimeter installed at a depth just below the rooting zone (120
    cm); and ET cb is the basal crop ET in mm. The daily measured volumetric soil
    water content (VWC) is calculated as the average of the volumetric water content
    measured using capacitance probes (Decagon 10 HS) installed at three depths (0–10
    cm, 35–45 cm, and 70–80 cm) at each of eight locations throughout the field. ET
    a is the measured ET from the surface renewal station located in the center of
    the field. As shown in Fig. 5(b), ET a and ET cb agree well during the early stages
    of crop development when the crop is well-watered. After June 8, 2011, daily ET
    cb exceeds total applied irrigation and after July 4, the cumulative water balance
    turns negative. This is reflected in the observed VWC which declines from June
    8 onwards. The sustained negative net water balance also reflects intentional
    deficit irrigation by the grower, and this deficit is captured by the difference
    between the surface renewal ET a measurements and the satellite-based ET cb estimates.
    Plants respond to water stress by reducing transpiration, and under the FAO-56
    approach, a crop water stress coefficient ( K s ) based on soil water content
    is used to account for this reduced transpiration in calculating ET c [12]. The
    addition of a K s coefficient of 0.85 to account for the deficit irrigation results
    in close agreement between the satellite-derived and surface renewal ET a estimates
    (Fig. 5(b)). This example illustrates the potential benefits of using surface
    observations of soil water content or soil water potential measurements in coordination
    with estimates of ET cb that integrate satellite and surface observations. The
    satellite-derived information can assist with tracking the daily irrigation demand,
    while soil moisture sensor networks provide an important check to ensure that
    the timing and magnitude of irrigation deficits are in-line with targets set by
    the grower. SECTION V. Data Distribution via Web Interface and Web Services While
    TOPS-SIMS simplifies the process of integrating satellite and surface observations
    to map K cb and ET cb values, distribution of data and information via intuitive,
    easy to use interfaces is critical to facilitating use of the information by water
    managers and agricultural producers who may not be familiar with the specialized
    data formats used by the remote sensing science community. A web-based user interface
    providing access to visualizations of TOPS-SIMS information eliminates the barriers
    to data access, as only a web browser is needed to view and query the information,
    and no knowledge of specialized data formats is necessary. The TOPS-SIMS web-based
    front-end relies on an open-source software stack that utilizes the Open Layers
    JavaScript library to display maps and execute queries on map data from within
    web browsers (Fig. 6(a)). To facilitate geographic searches by users and provide
    a spatial context for the TOPS-SIMS information products, the interface combines
    TOPS-SIMS overlays with a selection of open-source and commercial base map layers,
    including maps of streets, land use, and aerial imagery. NDVI, F c , and K cb
    overlays are updated on nominal 8-day intervals; ET cb is updated daily. In addition
    to providing views of TOPS-SIMS data at the native 30 m resolution, the web interface
    also allows users to retrieve quantitative information from any variable by specifying
    a point or polygon and requesting the most current values or a time-series summary
    (Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 6. The TOPS-SIMS web interface provides capabilities for visualization
    and data access, including support for geographic queries and selection of data
    for visualization by date. The map in (a) shows ET cb (mm/day) for 3.7 million
    hectares of farmland in the Central and Coastal Valleys on 02-Aug-2011. Retrospective
    time-series for TOPS-SIMS output can be generated, as shown by the K cb graph
    for 2011 for a location near Huron, CA (b). Time-series data can be downloaded
    from the interface in CSV format directly into a spreadsheet for further analysis.
    Show All The TOPS-SIMS web interface relies on data services provided by an open-source
    software stack running a Python-based web server. Tools from the Geographic Data
    Abstraction Library (GDAL) generate the tiles used in the web maps. The server
    responds to map queries by retrieving data resting on an OPeNDAP web service (Open-source
    Project for a Network Data Access Protocol; http://opendap.org) and generates
    time-series charts from the resulting data using the Matplotlib graphics library.
    OPeNDAP is a software framework that facilitates remote access to local data regardless
    of local storage format, and thus simplifies the process of making scientific
    data sets available for other applications via web services. A working beta-version
    of the interface and associated web data services are available at http://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/sims/,
    and are currently being evaluated by commercial growers, irrigation consultants,
    and water managers in California through a series of ongoing pilot studies. SECTION
    VI. Extending the TOPS-SIMS Framework The current TOPS-SIMS K cb and ET cb mapping
    capabilities demonstrate the potential utility of a modeling framework to integrate
    observations from satellite and surface sensor networks to provide new data and
    information services to the agricultural and water resource management user community.
    However, the TOPS-SIMS modular architecture also allows for a number of extensions
    that can be rapidly implemented to expand the data and information services. Key
    short term objectives include: i)linking TOPS-SIMS to ET o forecasts to provide
    forecasts of irrigation demand at various lead times; ii) use of web services
    and a model web approach [45] to integrate TOPS-SIMS outputs with operational
    and planning models utilized by water managers; iii) incorporation of site specific
    information provided by growers to include generation of customized reports; iv)
    expansion of inputs to include observations from a constellation of moderate resolution
    satellite sensors to increase observation frequency and improve the reliability
    and accuracy of data and information products from TOPS-SIMS; and v) incorporation
    of additional publicly available models for estimation of ET, including satellite-driven
    energy balance models for estimation of ET. At present, managers of agricultural
    water supplies generally rely on historic climate data and static estimates of
    irrigation demand when making decisions about the volume of water to release from
    reservoirs. For agricultural water delivery systems such as the Central Valley
    Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP), which together provide
    water for 3.75 million acres of California farmland, water managers must rely
    on this historical data to time water releases up to a week or more in advance
    to meet the needs of growers. While water managers must also consider a range
    of other factors, including environmental constraints and hydropower production,
    new sources of data on forecasted irrigation demand could support improvements
    in the ability to anticipate periods of particularly high demand in response to
    high temperatures or sustained winds, while conserving water during cooler periods
    with lower irrigation demand. The recent development of two experimental ET o
    forecasting systems provides the possibility of using forecasts of short-term
    water consumption in place of estimates derived from historic climate data and
    maps of cropping patterns. The NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Forecasted
    Reference ET (FRET) system2 forecasts ET o with a lead time of up to seven days.
    The FRET forecasts for California are driven by outputs from the Weather Research
    and Forecasting model (WRF) [46], and utilize WRF forecast fields to parameterize
    the Penman-Monteith equation for ET o as adopted by the Environmental Water Resources
    Institute, American Society of Civil Engineers [47]. Experimental 8-day forecasts
    and seasonal ET o outlooks are also being developed by the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Bureau of Reclamation, and employ statistical
    forecasting methods to provide probabilistic ET o outlooks3. Data from the NOAA
    NWS FRET system are already being ingested by TOPS-SIMS via a web service, and
    can be directly integrated with K cb maps to provide estimates of weekly irrigation
    demand over California at the scale of individual fields. Pending the outcome
    of ongoing analyses to identify biases and quantify uncertainty in these forecasts
    relative to observed ET o values from CIMIS, data from these forecast systems
    will be applied to produce and distribute ET cb forecasts to agricultural producers
    and water managers to assist in quantification of local, regional, and statewide
    crop water consumption and irrigation demand. Improved data on current and forecasted
    irrigation demand that incorporates satellite observations of crop conditions
    can also be incorporated into operational models utilized by the CDWR such as
    CALSIM [48], and planning models such as Cal-SIMETAW [49], [50]. Incorporating
    recent historic data into these models has potential utility for evaluating past
    decisions on water releases, identifying opportunities for future improvement
    in delivery of water to growers, and developing strategies for implementation
    of water markets during drought years. In cases where forecasted demand is significantly
    higher or lower than historic demand for a given period, water operations managers
    could adjust management practices and improve their ability to deliver water to
    growers when and where it is most needed. Satellite derived K cb and ET cb maps
    are also potentially valuable as inputs into longer term planning models, and
    the development of a 10+ year record of observed crop canopy conditions and K
    cb values could lead to improvements in models used for long term planning, such
    as Cal-SIMETAW. Because TOPS-SIMS is implemented on NEX and data products are
    already distributed via an OPeNDAP web service, integration with other models
    is straight-forward, as data can be requested via existing web services, and data
    not already available in the NEX archive can be rapidly generated by TOPS-SIMS.
    Incorporation of site-specific information from growers can assist in eliminating
    sources of uncertainty in estimating ET associated with crop type, the timing
    and amount of irrigation applied, and the irrigation system configuration. Research
    is ongoing to extend the TOPS-SIMS framework to allow growers to specify this
    information for individual fields, facilitating use of crop-specific relationships
    for mapping K cb from satellite data, and allowing growers to specify correction
    factors to account for intentional deficit irrigation or a leaching fraction.
    Grower information on precedent irrigation schedule and irrigation system type
    would allow estimation of soil evaporation and conversion of ET cb to ET c . Allowing
    growers to input information on irrigation system type and application rates would
    also allow TOPS-SIMS to translate ET cb into recommended irrigation system run
    times. TOPS-SIMS algorithms for deriving K cb from NDVI currently rely on data
    from the Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ , and MODIS satellite sensors, but NDVI can
    also be derived from observations from multiple other satellite sensors currently
    collecting data in the red and near-infrared wavelengths at resolutions from 20
    m to 60 m. Data from the SPOT-5 satellite instruments, the Indian Resource Satellite
    Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), and the upcoming Landsat Data Continuity Mission
    (LDCM) and Sentinel-2 satellite mission offer the potential for integration of
    observations into a “system of systems” to provide field-scale observations of
    crop canopy development multiple times per week, reducing data latency and data
    gaps resulting from cloud cover. While issues associated with inter-sensor calibrations
    must be fully resolved [51] and open data policies have not yet been finalized
    for all of these missions, TOPS-SIMS provides a framework for ingesting and compositing
    data from a constellation of moderate resolution (30–250 m) sensors to provide
    robust and reliable data and information services to agricultural producers and
    water managers. Finally, TOPS-SIMS is designed to support multiple models for
    estimation of ET from satellite observations, including energy balance models
    that incorporate information from the thermal bands on Earth observation satellites.
    The initial suite of algorithms implemented within TOPS-SIMS relies on the use
    of spectral information in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths to map F
    c and K cb values since this approach can be fully automated. As research progresses
    on automation of the internal calibration procedures for energy balance models
    [20], TOPS-SIMS is designed to support integration of these models, and to facilitate
    use of a suite of publicly-available models to provide a robust capability for
    automated, frequent, field-scale mapping of ET over regions the size of the western
    U.S. SECTION VII. Summary TOPS-SIMS employs a “system of systems” approach and
    applies the TOPS modeling framework to ingest observations from satellite and
    surface sensor networks to provide new data and information products to agricultural
    producers and water managers via easily accessible web interfaces and web services.
    The current framework supports near real-time mapping of indicators of crop canopy
    development and crop water consumption at field scales over 3.7 million ha of
    California farmland. Integration of satellite-derived estimates of basal crop
    evapotranspiration with observations of soil moisture from surface sensor networks
    offers promise for supporting agricultural producers and water managers working
    to optimize management of agricultural water resources. Use of the NEX computing
    architecture enables rapid processing of large volumes of satellite data and facilitates
    implementation of TOPS-SIMS over regions potentially as large as the western U.S.
    TOPS-SIMS is designed to integrate additional models and data services to support
    forecasting of crop irrigation requirements at weekly to seasonal lead times,
    and concurrent modeling of potential and actual crop evapotranspiration. Future
    integration of observations from a constellation of moderate resolution satellites
    would support further improvements in the frequency and long-term operational
    reliability of satellite-derived estimates of evapotranspiration and crop water
    requirements. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The energy-balance comparison data were generated

  description: Grapes cultivation in India is limited due to high recurring cost of
    cultivation. Controlling infield variability in yield and quality of grapes is
    a challenge for wineries. Vine soil-water status constitutes one of the main driving
    factors which affect plant vegetative growth, yield and wine quality. Providing
    the methods and tools for continuous measurement of soil and crop parameters to
    characterize the variability of soil water status will be of great help to the
    grape growers. To ensure the accurate estimation of irrigation and disease, their
    variability, management and evaluation in space-time over a grape field, inexpensive
    sensors and communication technology involving sensors for ambient temperature,
    wind velocity, ambient humidity, soil moisture and leaf wetness were deployed
    in an intensely cultivated commercial grape farm. The measured and recorded values
    of parameters in real time over a period of 3 months permitted the calculation
    of Evapotranspiration (ET) and 'Leaf Wetness'. Data collected from the sensors
    were sent via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) to a server 200 km away from
    the fields. The water requirement of 110 days of grape cultivation in the field
    ranges between 500 to 1200 mm and the values computed through the sensed parameters
    in this work ranged from 550-1500 mm. The ET in grape fields was three times higher
    than the ET of okra. Further results showed that wireless sensor network enabled
    distributed measurements, spreading sensors all over the field. The real time
    information from the fields such as, soil water content, temperature and plant
    characteristics provided a good base for making decisions such as irrigation (
    i.e. when and how much water to apply) and application of pesticides by computing

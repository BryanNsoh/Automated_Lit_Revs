    IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION The security
    of blockchain technology comes from the fact that the information is known by
    the \"public.\" Every transaction in the blockchain has to be approved by a majority
    of the blocks that are involved in it, and it can never be completely erased from
    the network [1]. Smart farming means using the new technologies that have come
    out at the start of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in agriculture and cattle
    production to increase the quantity and quality of production while making the
    best use of resources and having the least impact on the environment. The growing
    number of people in the world shows how important agriculture and farming are
    for growing and making enough food for everyone. Most countries'' economies depend
    a lot on how well they do in agriculture [3] [8]. The use of blockchain-based
    authentication can be an effective method for protecting IoT devices employed
    in smart farming. IoT devices allow farmers to keep tabs on things like temperature
    and soil moisture in order to better manage their farms. However, Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can cripple their performance
    and endanger the farm''s operations. Using blockchain-based authentication is
    one approach to ensuring the safety of Internet of Things devices. To ensure that
    only authorized devices have access to the system, blockchain technology provides
    a decentralized and tamper-proof method of verifying the identity of these devices.
    The first step in implementing blockchain-based authentication for smart farming
    is giving each Internet of Things device its own distinct identity. To achieve
    this, it is possible to give each gadget its own special identification number
    and record it in the distributed ledger. To gain entry, devices must first provide
    their unique identifier, which is then checked against a distributed ledger (blockchain)
    of authorized devices. One more benefit of blockchain-based authentication is
    that it can offer a trustworthy and clear method of monitoring the actions of
    Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. A farmer, for instance, can use blockchain technology
    to confirm that an Internet of Things device has carried out a certain action,
    like watering a plant, and that it has been carried out accurately. All things
    considered; blockchain-based authentication can be a potent tool for securing
    IoT devices used in smart farming. This system helps farmers better manage their
    operations by providing a secure and decentralized method of verifying the identity
    of devices and tracking their activities. In this paper, we look at possible to
    use blockchain technology and Radio Frequency Identification in cattle farming.
    These technologies could be used to keep track of important information and get
    it to the right people quickly. With this project, we hope to find a better way
    to handle this business''s information and update its infrastructure. Blockchain-based
    authentication for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in smart farming can solve
    several problems, including [10]: Data integrity: IoT devices generate a lot of
    data that is critical to smart farming operations. Blockchain-based authentication
    can help ensure the integrity of this data by preventing unauthorized devices
    from altering or corrupting it. Traceability: Blockchain-based authentication
    can provide a tamper-proof record of all IoT devices that access the network,
    which can help with traceability in the event of a security breach or other issue.
    Transparency: Smart farming involves multiple stakeholders, including farmers,
    processors, distributors, and consumers. Blockchain-based authentication can enhance
    transparency by providing a shared, immutable record of all IoT devices that access
    the network, which can help build trust between stakeholders. Efficiency: Blockchain-based
    authentication can help streamline the authentication process for IoT devices
    in smart farming by eliminating the need for intermediaries such as authentication
    servers, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency. Figure 1: RFID Cattle
    Flow Chart Show All Figure 1, we have shown how to RFID Cattle flow. A. Trade
    of between Blockchain storage and Cloud storage Cloud storage is the traditional
    way to store data. The biggest problem with cloud storage is that all the data
    is kept in one place and isn''t usually encrypted when transactions are made.
    Blockchain storage is an alternative to centralised store and in compare to the
    cloud storage that could be cheaper, safer, and more reliable. Every day, people
    who use cloud storage have to deal with cyber security. Providers of centralised
    cloud storage make copies of the data and store them in different data centres
    so that the data doesn''t get lost. When this happens, a lot of information is
    duplicated, which can lead to too much extra information. Also, the data centres
    that house cloud storage need high-end equipment. When it comes to data security,
    cloud storage relies on third parties. It uses the Software as a Service, Platform
    as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service models to offer services. Blockchain
    storage is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that provides a secure
    and immutable way to store data. Blockchain technology offers several benefits,
    including increased security, transparency, and reliability. On the other hand,
    blockchain makes sure that data is safe and correct without relying on third parties.
    In our work data are not very large so what even disadvantages with Blockchain
    that is not applicable there. The choice between blockchain storage and cloud
    storage ultimately depends on the specific needs and requirements of the user.
    If security and immutability are top priorities, then blockchain storage may be
    the best option. However, if scalability and accessibility are more important,
    then cloud storage may be the better choice. B. Motivations Using the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technology together makes it easier to keep an
    eye on fields. Using IoT and Blockchain technology to manage and coordinate, a
    good monitoring system is made. The Blockchain network is set up to keep information
    safe and help community members trust each other. use blockchain technology to
    find out who a user is. Smart systems have changed how industries work by making
    it possible to automate data collection, data sharing, monitoring, and responding
    to changes in the environment [2]. In smart IoT environments, IoT devices are
    usually set up to collect data and send it to a server to be processed and stored.
    Authorized users can use the collected data to take action and make decisions
    in different IoT applications. So, it is very important to authenticate end-user
    devices so that only authorized users can access cloud data. Even though the studied
    schemes provide authentication for end-user devices in IoT systems, they have
    several security flaws and are not as good as they could be [4] [5]. SECTION II.
    RELATED WORK Blockchain can be used in the livestock trade. But there are a few
    articles that talk about how RFID has changed the cattle business over the last
    20 years. Proposed a system based on RFID technology in which medical and physical
    information about animals is stored in a local database that farmers and veterinarians
    can access with mobile devices [8]. also suggested that RFID tags could be used
    in dairy farms to help reduce the amount of manual labour needed to keep track
    of information about each animal [9]. They also talk about how keeping an eye
    on how each cow''s temperature changes can help find signs of illness or a drop
    in milk production. Combining Blockchain technology with the Internet of Things
    (IoT) could take agriculture to the next level, allowing for more precise supply
    chain management and optimisation. The combination of blockchain technology and
    the Internet of Things will lead to improved visibility and management of agricultural
    operations [1]. Several Internet of Things (IoT) applications have already been
    built with blockchain. All of these studies demonstrate that incorporating blockchain
    technology into IoT applications enhances safety [13]. Since there hasn''t been
    a lot of prior work done on blockchain technology''s potential applications in
    the farming industry, our preliminary findings are novel in conceptual design
    and should inspire additional study in this area. We hope that by publishing these
    preliminary results, we can inspire further study in this area in the years to
    come [15]. A. Blockchain & Smart Contracts for IoT Blockchain is a type of distributed
    database that keeps track of a list of records that is always growing and is organized
    into things called blocks. Blockchain is a chain of these blocks, as the name
    suggests. Each block is linked to the one before it by a hash of the block before
    it. Contracts that are written in code and stored on a blockchain are called \"smart
    contracts.\" You can use them to automate transactions and make sure people follow
    the rules. IoT that works with GPS can also be used to make smart contracts that
    run automatically when certain conditions are met [14]. In this paper, discuss
    about how blockchain could be used with IoT devices. They talk about how IoT devices
    could work in a decentralized way with the help of blockchains. Instead of deploying
    everything from one place. It talks about how a Smart Farming using smart contracts
    and the Ethereum blockchain. It also talks about how IoT and blockchain can be
    used to use and share energy in the energy sector in a smart way. Problem Identification
    A blockchain-based smart application was implemented to securely store security-anomaly
    information and proactively mitigate similar attacks targeting other farms in
    the community. Via Block Chain based authentication and details will give us farming
    to grow and produce food. SECTION III. ARCHITECTURE In this section, we present
    our architecture for our blockchain-based IoT livestock tracking system. We give
    an overview. Our main components of the system are as follows [6] [7]: Device
    Registration: On the blockchain, each IoT device used in the smart farming system
    must be registered. This is done by giving each device a unique identifier and
    putting it on the blockchain. This step makes sure that only devices that are
    allowed to access the system can do so. Deploying Smart Contracts: Smart contracts
    are used to set the rules and conditions for getting into the system. The authentication
    process is enforced by these contracts that are put on the blockchain. Before
    letting the device into the system, the smart contract will check the device''s
    ID. Authenticating the device: When a device tries to get into the smart farming
    system, it must first give its unique identifier. The smart contract will then
    check the blockchain to make sure that the device is registered and allowed to
    access the system. Transaction Validation: Before letting the device into the
    system, the smart contract will check that the transaction started by the device
    is valid. This makes sure that the device only does things that are allowed. Data
    Storage: The blockchain is used to store data made by IoT devices, such as data
    about the environment. This makes sure that the data can''t be changed and is
    clear, giving an unchangeable record of what the device did. Device Management:
    The blockchain-based authentication system can also be used to manage devices.
    For example, if there is a security breach or the device breaks down, access to
    the device can be taken away. In smart farming, using blockchain-based authentication
    for IoT devices means registering devices on the blockchain, using smart contracts
    to enforce the authentication process, verifying device identity, validating transactions,
    storing data, and managing devices A. PROCESS Our process of tracking cattle.
    We''ve implemented a method where all relevant information is stored and accessible
    by designated authenticated members of the cattle farm in light of the exponential
    growth of data on cattle farms over time. The blockchain itself is put to use
    as a safeguard, with the hash of the relevant data being fully exploited to ensure
    the data''s integrity. Accessibility is a key feature of blockchain technology,
    and there are two varieties available: public and private. The main distinction
    between them is whether or not new users can join the chain without the existing
    users'' approval. A public blockchain, like the one on which Bitcoin operates,
    allows anyone to view its contents without the intervention of a central authority
    [11] [12]. Here, we introduce a secure blockchain system for internal use. This
    decision was driven by the project''s ultimate goal of helping ranchers exercise
    greater control over their own livestock. This means that the private blockchain
    only needs to be accessible to the authenticated users. TABLE 1: Information saved
    with Dummy Data B. Formal Process In general, the following steps make up a formal
    process for doing anything in a Blockchain-based Authentication system for IoT
    devices in smart farming: Authentication Request: The user tells the blockchain-based
    authentication system to do something by sending an authentication request. The
    action the user wants to take and the device identifier are both included in the
    request. Smart Contract Verification: The smart contract on the blockchain checks
    the user''s identity and the device identifier to make sure the user is allowed
    to do what is being asked. If the user is allowed, the next step will be taken
    by the smart contract. Action Execution: The user is now allowed to use the IoT
    device to do the requested action. For example, the user might want to turn on
    the irrigation system. The smart contract starts the action on the device, and
    the device does the action that was asked of it. Data Logging: After the action
    is done, the system writes information about it to the blockchain. This information
    includes the user who started the action, the identifier for the device, and the
    action that was done. This makes sure that there is a clear and unchangeable record
    of everything that happens in the system. Action Completion: When the action is
    done, the user is told whether it was successful or not. Device Management: The
    blockchain-based authentication system can also be used to manage devices. For
    example, if there is a security breach or the device breaks down, access to the
    device can be taken away. The administrator can use the system to manage devices
    in a way that is similar to what was explained above. Overall, a Blockchain-based
    Authentication system for IoT devices in smart farming requires an authentication
    request, smart contract verification, action execution, data logging, action completion,
    and device management to take any kind of action. These steps make sure that only
    authorized users can make changes to the system, and that all changes are recorded
    on the blockchain so that they can''t be changed. Blockchain technology can be
    a promising approach for decentralized authentication in IoT networks for cattle
    farming. When buying or selling cattle, it is important to verify the ownership
    of the cattle to ensure that the transaction is legitimate. Blockchain-based authentication
    can provide a secure and tamper-proof way to verify the original owner of the
    cattle. C. Working Unique Identifiers: Each cattle can be assigned a unique identifier
    that is recorded on the blockchain. This identifier can be a combination of RFID
    tags, QR codes, or other identification methods. Ownership Transfer: When cattle
    are sold, the ownership transfer is recorded on the blockchain as a transaction.
    This creates a tamper-proof and transparent record of ownership transfer that
    can be verified by anyone on the network. Traceability: The blockchain-based authentication
    system can also provide traceability of the cattle''s movement and health information.
    This information can be stored on the blockchain and accessed by authorized parties
    such as veterinarians or government officials. This can be particularly useful
    in case of theft or accidents, as it can help in the recovery and investigation
    process. Decentralization: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures
    that there is no single point of failure, making it difficult for hackers or malicious
    actors to tamper with the data. Key Benefits: Tamper-resistant records. Decentralized
    Authentication. Verify ownership transfer. Reducing the risk of fraud or theft.
    Security: Blockchain technology provides a highly secure way to authenticate IoT
    devices. Each device has a unique identity stored on the blockchain, which cannot
    be tampered with. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Transparency: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that every
    transaction is transparent and can be traced back to its source. This can be useful
    in the case of a security breach or if there is a need to audit the system. Trust:
    Blockchain-based authentication can help to build trust between different parties
    involved in the smart farming system. For example, farmers can be sure that the
    data they receive from IoT devices is accurate and reliable, while consumers can
    be sure that the food, they buy has been grown using sustainable and ethical farming
    practices. Efficiency: By using blockchain-based authentication, smart farming
    systems can reduce the need for manual authentication processes, which can be
    time-consuming and prone to errors. Cost-effectiveness: Blockchain-based authentication
    can be a cost-effective solution for smart farming systems, as it eliminates the
    need for expensive third-party authentication services. Blockchain-based authentication
    can help to ensure that the data collected by these devices is accurate, secure,
    and tamper-proof. Overall, blockchain-based authentication can provide many benefits
    for smart farming applications, including improved security, transparency, trust,
    efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the use of blockchain-based authentication
    in IoT networks for cattle farming can provide a secure and transparent way to
    verify ownership transfer, provide traceability, and ensure data integrity. This
    can help improve the efficiency and security of cattle farming operations while
    also reducing the risk of fraud or theft and blockchain networks to create tamper-resistant
    records of shared transactions. SECTION IV. CONCLUSION In this study, blockchain-based
    authentication in Smart Farming is discusses with IoT applications, research works
    are continuously finding new ways to apply it on society and lifestyle. This study
    takes advantage of this study''s findings and the credibility they inspire in
    cattle to usher in a more practical and technologically advanced future. The current
    infrastructure for rural livestock is one reason why blockchain technology is
    an intriguing development worth further investigation, which inspired the work
    presented here. Here the cattle informations are stored in the block chain, which
    is secure, when authentication of information is needed, it can be done easily.
    If there is any government assistance for any specific type of cattle, it is easy
    to find the details, and can directly transfer the benefits to the owner. As blockchain
    technology is still in its early stages, researchers are constantly coming up
    with novel uses for it in daily lives. In order to encourage cattle to begin moving
    towards a more practical and technologically advanced future, this study attempts
    to capitalise on the qualities and credibility this study generates. Preliminary
    study shown here is driven by the outdated infrastructure that now exists in rural
    cattle infrastructure, which makes blockchain technology an intriguing innovation
    deserving of further exploration. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Conference Location: Omu-Aran, Nigeria SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming utilises
    the idea of precision farming to improve farm yields through accurate knowledge
    and understanding of crop field unpredictability. This entails the examining environmental
    parameters for accurately allocating inputs using the specificity of the farmland
    (or site). In this way, farmers have the opportunity of automating and simplifying
    the procedure of collecting and examining farm data by employing smart farming
    practices. This enables farmers to make speedy, autonomous and intelligent decision-making
    about farming activities [1]. Smart farming are built on modern information and
    communication tools in agricultural value chain known as third green revolution
    [2]. Crop yields are influenced hugely by the farmers'' propensity to arrive at
    quicker and more precise decisions, which are complemented by the correct information
    or knowledge concerning various contiguous factors such as soil condition, weather,
    the precise amount of fertilizer to be applied, sunshine, water-filled property,
    rainfalls, topography and infiltration. Sensors and actuators have the potentials
    to efficiently assist farmer in obtaining environmental and soil factors for faster
    and smarter decisions [3]. The changes in the climatic conditions have negative
    consequences on numerous abiotic factors such as flooding, drought, rainfall,
    temperature, and solar radiation, which are mostly required for crop production
    (such as rice) throughout the phases of growth [4]. Crop information acquired
    from fields is an important tool for present-day farming practice and planning.
    This protects the environment, sustains food production, saves costs, and improves
    decision-making process [5]. IoT integrates billions of Internet-enabled sensors,
    cameras, wearable, displays, smartphones, and others to support exchanges through
    the Internet platform [6]. IoT empowers end-users, everyday Things, and machines
    to sense, communicate and interact with their external world, and increased quality
    of life through wide-ranging applications including smart homes, Industrial IoT,
    Internet of Farming, health, smart city, and others [7]–[9]. Two crucial problems
    are limiting loT-based applications include: insecure ad-hoc exchanges; and the
    inability to establish temporary session keys. Lightweight symmetric cryptography
    is being considered rather than asymmetric cryptography for constrained devices
    because of chip area, code size, energy dissipation, and runtime. But, asymmetric
    cryptography offers better security for applications in real-world scenarios [10].
    The privacy issues are widespread due to the nature and vulnerability of underlying
    IoT networks [7], [11]. Encryption schemes are valuable for safeguarding data
    transmissions and transactions in cloud-based applications (such as Blockchain)
    [12]. IoT has limited computing capacity, low power consumption and low volume,
    which compounds the complexity of implementing reliable cryptographic methods
    available [13]. Reference [10] enlisted the requirements of encryption approaches
    appropriate for IoT including: single execution per session, shorter keys and
    reduced size of codes, faster encryption, key generation and decryption operations
    as well as hardware implementation considerations. In this paper, two encryption
    modes based on hybrid cryptographic algorithms were investigated to ascertain
    their level of privacy guarantees for smart farming systems. The remaining sections
    of this paper are planned as follows: section two provides the review of the literature,
    the proposed scheme is outlined in section three, section four discusses the results,
    and section five is the conclusion. A. Research Issue and Objectives This paper
    develops a secure lightweight cryptographic scheme for smart farming devices.
    The main objectives include: To develop hybrid scheme (SHA-AES) based on two strong
    traditional cryptographic schemes (AES256 and SHA1-256). To increase the security
    of SHA-AES scheme with CBC and GCM hardening algorithms. To compare the performances
    of SHA-AES scheme based on CBC and GCM using key size, encryption (key generation)
    time, and decryption time. SECTION II. Literature Review A. Security Outlook of
    Smart Farming Systems The speedy developments of IoT technology has facilitated
    tangible and intangible values to be entrusted in its networks including physical
    assets, and digitally sensitive data [14]. The processes of collecting data, storing
    data and utilizing data are prone to privacy glitches in case of big data, IoT
    and cloud computing technologies. The preserving privacy of cloud data remains
    promising open area of research [15]. In cloud, data storage and transactions
    are highly susceptible to fraud due to lack of transparency among parties, corruption
    and mismanagement within distributed ledger databases and centralized storage
    architectures [16]. In case of IoT, its devices, links, channels, computation,
    storage and microservices re susceptible to attacks [17]. Wireless technology
    underpins IoT, which foster real-time collaborations for highly sophisticated
    applications in areas of military, precision monitoring, remote monitoring, commercial,
    smart home and others. Security of IoT is worsening due to trust and malicious
    tendencies within the Internet connectivity. Also, the physical features of IoT
    (including computational, power, transmission range and short-leaved memory) have
    constrained existing security solutions [18]. Another conventional approach for
    securing IoT networks is Public Private Key Infrastructure systems. Though, it
    is incapable of meeting the centralized authority peculiarity for public key validation,
    leading to exploitations and one-point of failure [14]. Elliptic Curve Digital
    Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) initiated the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for
    open-source schemes and Internet-based applications. ECDSA offers a high rate
    of security due to its capability to calculate a point multiplication without
    reversing (or computing the multiplicand with original and product points). It
    is public key cryptography and deployed for Bitcoin (that is, private and public
    keys generations) and secure communications, critical infrastructure, protected
    Internet exchanges, smart devices, and Wireless Fidelity [19]. Recently, public
    blockchain technology was introduced for safeguarding privacy of IoT data. But,
    several shortcomings have been highlighted such as large bandwidth, extended computation,
    latency and restricted scalability [20], [21]. Blockchain-based security approaches
    could target IoT''s network edge (local level) and the physical hardware/software
    levels [17]. While middleware software-oriented architectures allow interoperability
    of dissimilar IoT and blockchain technologies [22]. B. Related Works The modes
    of encryption schemes necessitate public or private keys and encrypted messages
    to be broadcast among participants through network links. Privacy leaks and compromises
    could happen in the process. The growth of untrusted servers, cloud operators
    and providers have further compounded anonymization problems. It became possible
    to retain, manipulate and link users'' transactions to their identity in a long
    run. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is capable of dealing with trust issues caused
    by third-party manipulation of users'' data encrypted in the cloud because decryption
    is near impossible [23]. A hybrid of HE and public keys-based traditional encryptions
    allows direct operations on ciphertexts. Data broadcasts, retrieval, storage and
    aggregation can be privacy-protected with HE especially in cloud and wireless
    sensor networks. HE in itself alone cannot guarantee privacy preservation but,
    it could conceal data and increase confidentiality of ciphertexts [24], [25].
    The outsourced data privacy preservation for user-specific services was undertaken
    by [26]. A new security solution combined labelled homomorphic encryption, and
    FEET algorithms to build HIKE lightweight protocol. HIKE provides secure and private
    safekeeping, computation, and non-disclosure of users'' data. It is a weak against
    malicious server attacks. Reference [27] utilized fully HE in blended operation
    model, which executes blended arithmetic operations on the cloud in a less complicated
    manner, not without overheads. Reference [28] proposed lightweight stream encryption
    algorithms (LWSE) with a shuffling process on the plain image before encryption.
    The modified LWSE offered better security for embedded hardware (ARM7 core) and
    real-time applications with shorter execution time, and code size. Data encryption
    within IoT networks imposes timing overheads, which is undesirable regardless
    of the security benefits. Richards et al. [29] demonstrated that, utilizing 128-bit
    key size for Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC) encryption was 1.24 times longer as Counter
    (CTR), and 2.54 times later as Electronic Codebook (ECB). It follows that, longer
    key sizes (such as 192 and 256-bits) produced longer data encryption timing. IoT
    advances and applications have unmatched security efforts towards their processes
    and exchanges. The mode of data harvesting through them has many implications
    on the privacy of users [30]. Lightweight cryptography and dynamic keys were taunted
    to protect exchanges between IoT and servers. Lightweight encryption algorithms
    provide scalable key size, simpler architecture, number of rounds, and block sizes.
    But, these are less secure, unsafe or moderate requiring extra perfections to
    avert security threats [11]. Reference [31] planned a lightweight data privacy-preserving
    aggregation method (that is, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Homomorphic Paillier encryption,
    and one-way hash chain) for fog computing-based Things. This method aggregates
    data with early recognition of injected false data attacks at network edge. Aside
    differential privacy attained; simplified communication overheads and low-cost
    derivations were observed. IoT facilitates exchanges among constrained objects,
    low resources, process computation regulation and decision-making [11]. Though,
    few challenges were acknowledged such as storage capacity, cost of performance,
    security, smaller battery, and large energy dissipation [32]. The quest to maintain
    the confidentiality of IoT devices is desirable because of enormous data generated
    and exchanged across them. But, traditional cryptosystems (such as AES and DES)
    offered varying security solutions whose ciphers structures are unfitted for resource-constrained
    devices [33]. The security and privacy of data from smart systems are problematic
    during gathering, integration, storage, and transformation of data in fulfilling
    the needs of agri-food sector and its players. Hence, some forms of data governance
    are expected for production control systems. Reference [34] proposed an extension
    mushroom farm decentralized process control system based on Blockchain and IoT
    for improving environmental factors gathering; thereby supplementing autonomous
    production control system. The lack of precise data and exchanges adversely hampers
    farm management and production. To this end, Reference [35] suggested the use
    of IoT in place of conservative farming practice to increase monitoring of farming
    activities, farm and farmers'' well-being through unlimited data access. The prospects
    of IoT in advancing the agricultural sector to deliver food to over 9.6 billion
    world population by 2050 were highlighted in [36]. To enable farmers to cope with
    massive demands for produce, IoT-based smart farming. Though, the overall architecture;
    processes and requirements for smart farming left out data privacy of underlying
    IoT devices and less-secure public networks exchanges. In rural setups, wireless
    networks, and fog computing have the propensity of linking dispersed farm bases
    [37]. To improve the efficiency, sensing, latency, and actuating of this technique,
    a simplified network arrangement for monitoring and controlling farms locally
    was developed using a cross-layer routing and channel access scheme. Nevertheless,
    there are greater risks of data manipulation, and tampering. SECTION III. The
    Proposed Scheme This paper proposes a hybrid scheme of two strongest cryptographic
    schemes (AES256 and SHA1-256) used commonly for resource-constrained devices [28],
    [38], which is known as SHA-AES. The ECB and GCM encryption modes are widely used
    to increase Hamming distance of ciphers and security status (complexity, diffusion
    state, and confusion state). The hardening schemes of HE, Blowfish, and base64encode
    are used to fortify the resultant cryptographic algorithms. The performances of
    both encryption modes based on encryption algorithms are measured using speed
    and memory complexities. The agricultural sensor datasets for the study were sourced
    from the University of Califonia, Irvine. The optimal experimental setup for validating
    the proposed lightweight cryptographic scheme as shown in Table 1. Table I. The
    minimal experimental settings SECTION IV. Discussion of Results The validation
    of the proposed hybrid encryption with a hardening algorithm composed of high-performing
    cryptographic primitives of AES256 and SHA1-256 schemes. Two forms of hardening
    procedures were introduced (that is, CBC and GCM) whose outcomes are presented
    in Tables II and III. Table II. The performance of cbc-based sha-aes scheme Table
    III. The performance of gcm-based sha-aes scheme From Tables II and III, the average
    performances of both encryption modes applied to the proposed SHA-AES schemes
    in preserving the privacy of smart farming systems are illustrated in Fig. 1.
    Fig. 1. The performance of sha-aes scheme evaluated. Show All From Fig. 1, the
    CBC-based SHA-AES scheme was best in terms of speed of encryption (8.34%) and
    decryption (43.42%) as well as memory consumption for secret key sizes (50.00%)
    and ciphertext sizes (26.88%) when compared to GCM approach. The security provided
    by GCM was the highest though, ineffective for protecting resources-constrained
    devices used to power smart farming systems. More so, the comparative analysis
    of the SHA-AES (CBC) against ECC, and ECDSA in terms of encryption time. These
    revealed that, the proposed SHA-AES (CBC) scheme significantly offers faster key
    generation time (1689.25 s) against SHA-AES (GCM) (18090.63 s), ECC (16622.61
    s) and ECDSA (11110.95 s) as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. The performance of sha-aes
    against existing schemes. Show All SECTION V. Conclusion This paper underscored
    the numerous potentials of IoT and associated wireless technologies in supporting
    smart farming processes around the world. Nevertheless, several factors have been
    identified as impacting the effectiveness of these technologies including low
    technical know-how, lack of required settings, insecurity of channels, energy
    consumption, scalability, efficiency, hardware constraints, low resource devices,
    large process requirements, and ineffective security solutions (such as encryption
    procedures). The topmost issue inhibiting IoT usage in farming is privacy, which
    is further compounded by hardware and software constraints. The quest to make
    encryption solutions relevant for IoT-based systems brings on stronger lightweight
    cryptography schemes to the interests of academics [39], [40]. Though, lightweight
    cryptography schemes are weak and susceptible to attacks and breaches, encryption
    modes, hybrid encryption algorithms, and hardening procedures could raise security
    status (that is, complexity, diffusion state, and confusion state) [40], [41].
    The results obtained revealed the superiority of CBC based SHA-AES scheme over
    GCM encryption modes in terms of speed and memory complexities. In the future,
    more lightweight cryptosystems can be developed using the proposed approach to
    protect the privacy of smart farming. Particularly, the memory consumption and
    time taken can be minimised by generating shorter secret key sizes to target resource-constrained
    devices. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is partially sponsored by the Confluence

    to reach 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050 [1]. Providing food at an
    appropriate time, in the right quantity and quality to an ever-increasing population
    places a significant strain on the global food supply chain (FSC), exacerbated
    by challenges pertaining to food quality, food safety, food wastage, food price
    volatility, deforestation, and carbon emissions. In addition, product origin traceability,
    FSC transparency, and smart farming safety are also key challenges that affect
    an FSC [2]. An FSC comprises five key players: producer, processor, distributor,
    retailer, and consumer (Fig. 1). It is responsible for the transmission of food
    from producers to consumers. A traditional FSC is a system with a centralized,
    monopolistic, and asymmetric structure. As a result, food products cannot be traced
    within an FSC, leading to food fraud, data tampering, and counterfeit information.

    Fig. 1. Food supply chain. Haber and Storneta introduced blockchain in 1991 [3].
    In a white paper published a decade ago, a mysterious individual, or possibly
    a group, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, defined Bitcoin as a blockchain-based solution
    to the double-spending problem [4]. Bitcoin utilizes blockchain to enable secure
    financial transactions without the need for a trusted central authority, like
    banks and financial institutions. Blockchain ensures that the history of a digital
    asset is immutable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic
    hashing. Data integrity, decentralization, and high reliability are all features
    of blockchain. In recent years, smart technologies, such as blockchain, have emerged
    as a basic approach adopted in many sectors, including agri-food 4.0 [5], healthcare
    [6,7], energy [8], environment [9], aquaculture [10], and banking [11]. Blockchain-based
    traceability systems use a consensus process within FSC entities to store transaction
    data on blockchains throughout transportation so that customers can examine all
    information and verify products'' authenticity. Further, blockchain provides an
    immutable record of transactions with smart contracts, which may help in improving
    food safety and quality [[12], [13], [14]]. Additionally, blockchain''s integration
    with other smart technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID), and Near Field Communication (NFC) sensors, supports transparency,
    traceability, and data privacy and reduces the number of incorrect data entries
    [[15], [16], [17]]. Researchers have reviewed the implementation of blockchain
    in FSCs through different perspectives. • The author in Ref. [18] compared traditional
    traceability systems in the food industry to blockchain-based traceability systems.
    • In Refs. [19,20], and [21], the authors conducted a literature review on blockchain
    applications for traceability in the Agri Food Supply Chain (AFSC) area and explored
    the challenges and benefits. • The authors in Ref. [22] analyzed the literature
    to determine what level of analytics were used (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive),
    what sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) goals were met (social, environmental,
    and economic), and what supply chain data collection processes and resources were
    used. • The authors in Ref. [23] conducted a word map analysis of scholarly papers
    linked to food traceability. According to this survey, the majority of work is
    focused on food quality and safety technology. Moreover [24], provided a bibliometric
    analysis of documents related to blockchain in the food and agriculture industry.
    • A systematic literature review of research articles related to drivers and barriers
    for blockchain adoption was conducted in Ref. [25]. Additionally, a novel framework
    was proposed, and future research scope was discussed. • The systematic literature
    review in Ref. [26] addressed the application of blockchain in the sector of plant
    food safety, animal food safety, and processed food safety. • The authors in Ref.
    [27] conducted a literature assessment on blockchain''s uses in AFSCs to achieve
    sustainability and provide future directions for addressing the field''s current
    issues. • The researchers in Ref. [28] discussed food sector issues, such as food
    safety and security, bioactive food compounds, and sustainability during the COVID-19
    pandemic, and discussed innovative ideas to make a radical change in this sector
    during the lockdown period and post COVID-19 era. • The researchers in Ref. [29]
    examined the usage of blockchain in agriculture and addressed current strategies
    to promote its adoption in this area. An illustration, namely the blockchain application
    and future development plans for COVID-19 global food crises, was used to validate
    the effective use of blockchain in this industry. • The authors in Ref. [30] discussed
    the importance of integrating IoT and blockchain. They also presented a novel
    blockchain-based methodology to address the major difficulties in precision agriculture
    using IoT. To the best of the authors’ understanding, previous literature has
    not explored much the effects of blockchain in FSCs around the world. The authors
    could find only a limited number of articles on the implementation of blockchain
    in FSCs in the Scopus database. It was observed that in the published literature,
    no study has covered or listed the various applications of blockchain in FSCs,
    addressed current hurdles, or discussed potential solutions in a single article.
    To fill this gap, this review article intends to provide a comprehensive literature
    review and a bibliometric analysis of blockchain in FSCs. The present study focuses
    on the following aspects: • Applications of blockchain in FSCs. • Challenges associated
    with the application of blockchain in FSCs. • Potential solutions and methodologies
    that may be adopted for the successful implementation of blockchain in FSCs. •
    Future research directions. • Bibliometric analysis to analyze the current research
    trends. Based on the abovementioned aspects, the authors have tried to identify
    the answers to the three primary research questions (RQs) given below: RQ1. How
    can blockchain address the present scenario where an ever-increasing global population
    is placing an immense burden on FSCs? RQ2. What are the major challenges for the
    implementation of blockchain in FSCs and what can be the potential solutions?
    RQ3. What are the recent study trends in the field of blockchain in FSCs? This
    paper is organized as follows. The basic concept of blockchain is presented in
    Section 2. The review''s research approach is discussed in Section 3. A complete
    literature review is presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the bibliometric
    analysis. The discussion related to the present article is given in Section 6.
    Section 7 provides concluding remarks, limitations, and future scope. 2. Blockchain
    technology Blockchain is a shared, immutable, and a distributed ledger of information
    that keeps a record of transactions. It is a peer-to-peer network in which nodes
    from different networks are connected but do not trust each other. The ledger
    of each node keeps a track of transactions and ensures that they are always synchronized.
    Data integrity, decentralization, and high reliability are the prime features
    of blockchain. An added advantage is that it does not rely on a third party for
    communication and transaction between nodes. The general structure of blockchain
    is depicted through Fig. 2. The verified data are kept in a chain of hash-linked
    blocks in a sequential order. Download : Download high-res image (400KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. General structure of blockchain. The blocks
    are updated into a chain-like system after verification by a certain node chosen
    through an agreed-upon consensus procedure. The database of a blockchain is not
    just an array; it is a ledger that contains all prior transactions for all the
    entities in a blockchain network and has distinguished features, like decentralized
    control, low latency, high throughput, tamper-proof data storage, and built-in
    security. 2.1. Types of blockchains As illustrated in Fig. 3, a blockchain''s
    structure may be permissionless or permissioned. While permissionless blockchain
    has only one subtype—public blockchain—permissioned blockchain has two subtypes—private
    blockchain and federated blockchain. These are explained in the next three subsections.

    Fig. 3. Types of blockchain. 2.1.1. Public blockchain It is a permissionless blockchain.
    Anyone can join the blockchain network, send a new transaction, and participate
    in the consensus method to add a new block to the ledger. An anonymous person
    can check old records after joining the blockchain network because it is open
    to the public. A secure public blockchain is created by the combination of cryptographic
    verification and economic inducement using Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake
    (PoS). 2.1.2. Private blockchain It is a permissioned blockchain where only a
    particular organization has the authority to join the blockchain, send a new transaction,
    and take part in the consensus mechanism for adding a new block. It follows centralized
    implementation, wherein anyone wanting to join the network must get permission
    from the approved organization. Then, the organization allows a person to read,
    write, or contribute. In the case of a private blockchain, verifying a new block
    takes less time and power because the participant entities are small in number.
    The central authority is forced to use the consensus procedure. 2.1.3. Federated
    blockchain It is also a permissioned blockchain. It is a private blockchain for
    a specific group of businesses. The approval of a specific group of organizations
    is required in order to join this blockchain network. Blockchains of such type
    are useful in financial organizations. 2.2. Hash function A hash function is a
    multipurpose function that can be used for generating an address or a digital
    signature and a consensus mechanism. It converts data of any size into fixed-size
    values. It is, however, extremely difficult to retrieve the original data using
    a hash value. Furthermore, hash values of two different pieces of data could never
    be identical. As a result, a hash function is a useful data integrity function.
    According to the complexity of data, SHA 256 and message digest 5 (MD5) are the
    two most commonly utilized hash algorithms in blockchain [31]. 2.3. Merkle Tree
    A Merkle tree is a binary tree-like data structure, as seen in Fig. 4. At a leaf
    node, it stores a hash of transaction data, while at a non-leaf node, it holds
    a hash of transaction data''s descendants. A Merkle root is a tree''s root [32].
    A Merkle tree supports data verification which becomes a challenging task as the
    number of transactions in a distributed peer-to-peer system grows, making the
    process computationally expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Data
    verification ensures that data are consistent across all nodes. Download : Download
    high-res image (274KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Merkle tree.
    A Merkle tree efficiently carries out the task of data verification. For example,
    to check whether Transaction A has been amended or not, the server provides an
    audit trail of Hash Value CD and Hash Value B information. The node, then, computes
    Hash Value AB using Hash Value A (which it already has) and Hash Value B (which
    the trusted server has provided). After that, a trusted server computes Hash Value
    ABCD from Hash Value AB and Hash Value CD. If calculated Hash Value ABCD is the
    same as the Merkle root of Transaction A, B, C, and D, it validates transaction
    A. 2.4. Smart contract On a blockchain network, a smart contract is a set of lines
    of executable programming codes. It is self-executing and self-verifying and may
    perform a transaction amongst mutually untrustworthy entities. Each contract statement''s
    execution is recorded in a blockchain as an immutable transaction. When any specified
    terms and conditions are met, smart contracts ensure adequate access control and
    control enforcement, and a smart contract is promptly implemented. 2.5. Consensus
    mechanism A fundamental challenge in a blockchain network is obtaining a consensus
    among the mutually untrustworthy individuals. This can be done through the consensus
    method that is used to approve the contents of a ledger. A new block is added
    to a blockchain once it is verified by all other nodes in the network. There are
    several types of consensus mechanisms, out of which we will discuss the five most
    commonly used mechanisms in the following subsections. 2.5.1. Proof of Work Proof
    of Work (PoW) is one of the most commonly used methods to achieve consensus among
    the nodes in a network. It was introduced and employed by Nakamoto for Bitcoin
    [4]. In this approach called “mining” in the cryptocurrency-based blockchain,
    all nodes compete to solve a mathematical challenge. PoW''s primary advantages
    are its decentralized structure, high levels of security, and acceptable levels
    of scalability, whereas its main downsides are low throughput, energy inefficiency,
    high computational cost, and hardware dependency [33]. 2.5.2. Proof of Stake Next
    to PoW, Proof of Stake (PoS) is the most popular consensus mechanism. Here, validators
    are used instead of miners. As a consensus mechanism, Nxt and Blackcoin use PoS.
    Nodes must deposit a particular quantity of coins in the system to prove stakes,
    which decreases the need for processing power [34]. However, nodes with a large
    number of stakes are more likely to become block validators. The benefits of PoS
    include quick block formation, high throughput, low energy consumption, and no
    need for additional hardware. The disadvantage of PoS is that it creates some
    centralization [33]. 2.5.3. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance To address the
    Byzantine general problem [35], Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) was
    developed [36]. In this technique, first, a block “proposed” based on the round-robin
    procedure is chosen; then, this block advertises to the network and collects 3f+1
    nodes, where f is a failure node. A block proposal becomes valid to add to a blockchain
    network if two-thirds of the validators agree on it. 2.5.4. Proof of Activity
    The authors in Ref. [37] proposed Proof of Activity (PoA) as a hybrid of the finest
    features of PoW and PoS. PoA is the consensus technique used by Decred (DCR) and
    Espers. Mining in PoA begins with PoW and subsequently shifts to PoS. A attack
    in PoA would necessitate mining power and of all coins at the same moment; therefore,
    it is impossible. As a result of this, PoA is more secure than PoW and PoS. 2.5.5.
    Proof of Elapsed Time On top of the SGX technology, Intel has added the Proof
    of Elapsed Time (PoET). The PoET consensus technique is frequently used in permissioned
    blockchains. Each node in blockchain networks produces a random wait time and
    goes to sleep for the set duration after signing the proclamation. The first node
    to wake up adds a new block to the blockchain. PoET is a semi-centralized consensus
    process due to its reliance on Intel. The application context, robustness, kind
    of blockchain platform, and the type of blockchain are all factors to consider
    when choosing a consensus mechanism. As blockchain grows in popularity, the number
    of consensus techniques is growing as well. As a result, designing a consensus
    mechanism in the field of blockchain remains an open challenge. 3. Data collection
    and methodology On June 15th, 2021, the necessary data for conducting a full literature
    review and bibliometric analysis were gathered from the SCOPUS platform. (“Food
    Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”) OR (“Agri-Food Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”)
    OR (“Agri Product Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”) OR (“Agri-Based Food Product
    Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”) or (“Agricultural Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”)
    were the phrases used to select the articles. A language filter was used to select
    only the documents written in English. The collected articles were analyzed according
    to the different types of food. Articles dealing with “meat,” “pork,” “halal meat,”
    and “beef” were omitted, as these form a separate area of study. Finally, the
    articles were assessed using the journal index. This analysis excluded articles
    that were not included in these two indexes: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE)
    or Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). A total of 150 publications were chosen
    as a result of this approach, and their literature review and bibliometric analysis
    are described in sections 4 Literature review, 5 Bibliometric analysis, respectively.

    publications on blockchain in FSCs with two subsections: (i) Application, which
    covers the various applications of blockchain in FSCs, and (ii) Potential solutions
    given by the researchers for blockchain adoption in FSCs and the existing barriers
    for the same. 4.1. Application Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger
    system that is one of the disruptive technologies reforming FSCs by improving
    traceability and transparency while removing intermediary reliance. Furthermore,
    by reducing information asymmetry, it improves data management [[38], [39], [40],
    [41]]. Currently, blockchain is being implemented by start-ups as well as existing
    enterprises to reformulate their business models [42] and to provide a secure
    and transparent FSC beneficial in earning consumers'' and stakeholders’ confidence
    [2]. It has been shown that the blockchain technology platform has a substantial
    impact on the digital agri-food business model [43]. RFID, IoT, NFC, big data,
    robotics, and hyperspectral imaging are some emerging technologies aiding the
    development of a traceable FSC. A traceability system for an FSC gives consumers
    an access to check product adulteration and reduces information asymmetry [41,44].
    Blockchain''s advanced information and communication technology in conjugation
    with sensors, such as the IoT and RFID, can make an FSC more efficient. Researchers
    have agreed that in coming years blockchain will be a superior technology for
    ensuring information security, traceability, and autonomy, as well as in providing
    a minimum viable solution for FSCs [30,[45], [46], [47]]. Batch mixing with AI,
    quality forecasting with big data, and a blockchain-based traceability system
    are some other unique technologies that improve the traceability of processed
    foods [48]. In FSCs, blockchain is mainly applied in the field of product authentication,
    finance, and logistics as more transparency and traceability are required in these
    sectors. Therefore, we have divided this literature study into four categories
    (shown in Fig. 6) (i) Product Authentication, (ii) Finance, (iii) Logistics, and
    (iv) Miscellaneous. Miscellaneous category includes the papers which do not come
    under the other three categories, such as reducing labor costs in restaurants,
    smartly scheduling the watering system, and grading the food quality for human
    consumption. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    In [49], the authors presented a blockchain-based provenance system for the provenance
    of agricultural products to establish a trust between the stakeholders within
    the agricultural product supply chain. They devised two data-recording structures:
    (1) Basic Planting Information: to keep track of production, storage, and other
    procedures and (2) Provenance Record: to keep track of certain agricultural operations.
    In Ref. [50], the authors used the Proof of Authority consensus mechanism. The
    suggested system is implemented on the Ethereum platform and is tested on Walmart''s
    supply chain. The experimental results showed that the suggested system is capable
    of tracking product provenance while also ensuring data immutability and security.
    The researchers in Ref. [51] proposed a blockchain-based traceability system with
    a smart contract to address classic FSC issues, like security, information asymmetry,
    and system integration challenges. Visibility, security, and operations automation
    were all improved as well. However, the suggested system''s scalability and transaction
    speed had severe flaws. Meanwhile, in Ref. [52], the authors combined a blockchain-based
    Hyperledger fabric technology with the existing traditional FSC to improve transparency
    by tracing food products from farm to fork. They assigned a unique code to each
    type of food and primarily focused on developing a basic blockchain-based FSC
    and reducing the central authority''s oversight. Hyperledger-based food trading
    and traceability system “Hyper-FTT” was introduced by researchers in Ref. [53]
    for government, enterprises, and consumers. Aggregation of food warehouse companies,
    food processing enterprises, and food retailers was required to reach an agreement
    and complete a commercial transaction throughout the chain, which could help develop
    trust in food tracking. The experiments’ results revealed that the order service
    has a significant impact on the system throughput in various setups. The authors
    in Ref. [54] introduced ProductChain to find the provenance of a product that
    was under the jurisdiction of an FSC organization. ProductChain is a three-tier
    permissioned blockchain-based structure that ensures that data are available to
    consumers. The testing results showed that the suggested framework only takes
    a few milliseconds to query the order''s product ledger. Furthermore, security
    research revealed that the proposed system is adaptable to a large number of customers
    as well as network-based threats. In [55], the authors proposed a blockchain-based
    FSC traceability architecture. It manages supply chain stakeholders and product
    creation processes with the help of a smart contract. The proposed system, applied
    to the dairy industry, provides a complete traceability flow. To limit the degree
    of centralization, the researchers proposed a blockchain-based traceability system
    built on the Hyperledger Fabric platform in Ref. [56]. Milk was chosen as the
    subject of food traceability. They worked on the overall design as well as the
    network architecture. The authors in Ref. [57] proposed a unique information system
    architecture based on blockchain for a grain supply chain. The proposed system
    is a unique platform that improves blockchain storage efficiency by adopting a
    multimode storage technique. Furthermore, a customized smart contract was proposed
    to achieve corporate data interaction and supply chain hazard information supervision.
    The Hyperledger Fabric was used to create the prototype system. The proposed system
    was tested using a specific test case. The findings showed that the suggested
    method assures food safety and information storage dependability. However, the
    question regarding the data''s reliability still remains. The usage of sensors,
    such as the IoT, to collect data could help solve this problem. The authors in
    Ref. [58] presented a private blockchain-based traceability system made up of
    five Ethereum-based organizations that employed a smart contract to audit all
    transactions inside the supply chain entities. The InterPlanetary File System
    (IPFS) stores all the validated transaction data. The findings of the experiments
    were also promising. AgroVita, based on blockchain, was proposed in Ref. [59]
    as a way to empower customers, farmers, and retailers. At each stage of the proposed
    system, the transaction data were stored in blockchain, and each entity had access
    to track the products from farm to retailer. It established a traceability system
    that can be trusted. Consumers have adequate knowledge about food products to
    decide whether or not they want to buy, thanks to the unique methodology described
    in Ref. [60] to integrate blockchain in FSCs. In addition, a case study on the
    use of blockchain in the Colombian organic coffee sector was completed. Its methodology''s
    versatility and adaptability make it suited for any product and supply chain.
    The authors in Ref. [61] proposed a blockchain-based FoodTrail system, which improves
    FSC traceability. The suggested system has a four-layer design and is built on
    the Hyperledger Sawtooth framework. The depth-first technique was used to examine
    the blockchain''s stored data. The results of the experiments demonstrated that
    it underperforms when conducting a transaction. However, it does not rely on intermediaries,
    which reduces its dependency on a third party and lowers implementation costs.
    In [62], the authors presented a traceability system for e-commerce agricultural
    products based on blockchain to ensure these items’ food safety and quality. The
    authors in Ref. [63] utilized blockchain for seed supply chain traceability. The
    authors in Ref. [64] presented a blockchain application for the information security
    of an FSC and compared it to the classical supply chain in the context of China.
    According to the findings, the introduced application can assist manufacturers
    and consumers in tracking, auditing, and verifying an FSC. In [65], the author
    proposed a complete solution for a blockchain-based FSC that gives a solution
    from start to finish for each operation. It is built on the Ethereum platform,
    and interaction between actors within supply chain smart contracts is used. IPFS
    was utilized to get the hash value of the transaction data stored on the blockchain
    instead of transaction data. According to simulation results, the suggested system
    requires a particular amount of gas for smart contract deployment and execution.
    The researchers in Ref. [66] also employed IPFS for a blockchain-based traceability
    system for a soybean supply chain built on the Ethereum platform and smart contracts
    to regulate all transactions among all organizations inside the supply chain.
    A public blockchain traceability system using a smart contract was proposed to
    ensure transparency in the organic FSC in Ref. [67]. Farmers’ reputation was determined
    together with their products using a token-based approach; farmers could acquire
    a reputation by placing certification. The ASC uses a unique QR code to validate
    the food quality and origin. The researchers in Ref. [68] also employed a QR code
    to verify goods. The newly introduced blockchain-based traceability solution based
    on the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform can be used for the European Union and linked
    with existing traceability standards and processes. In [69], the authors introduced
    an information system that effectively tracks and monitors the entire food process
    from farm to fork, as well as critical stages of production, logistics, and land
    auditing. They presented consumers with an application that allowed them to obtain
    information about the production process they had purchased. The authors in Ref.
    [70] proposed a “blockchain + agriculture” traceability system for food safety.
    The proposed model is divided into four layers: data, technology, management,
    and application. It lowers the cost of data storage while increasing operational
    efficiency. In [71], the authors proposed a one-code-one-item system to improve
    food traceability on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology. It assigns
    a unique QR code to each food item and encrypts it using AES encryption technology.
    The authors in Ref. [72] presented a blockchain-based solution for the Italian
    Carasau bread supply chain that includes smart contracts, IPFS, and IoT to enable
    transparent, secure, and auditable traceability. All actors in the supply chain
    may verify the product''s quality. In [73], the authors presented a blockchain-based
    tracking system for fruit and vegetable agricultural products to address the issue
    of centralized administration. It improves the traceability of information''s
    transparency and believability. A dual storage structure of on-chain and off-chain
    was introduced to alleviate the load pressure on the chain. Furthermore, the performance
    analysis results revealed that the suggested system fits the criteria of the actual
    application. In [74], the authors introduced a blockchain-based tracing system
    for cocoa production. Watermarking technique was used for authentication and detection
    of manipulation of data. The proposed solution is more robust due to the usage
    of a two-factor blockchain for data documentation and validation. The authors
    in Ref. [75] proposed a blockchain-based FSC provenance system that was coupled
    with IoT and advanced deep learning. Using this system, before consuming, consumers
    can track the food''s provenance. Stakeholders can use advanced deep learning
    technology to optimize their inventory by collecting future projections and temporal
    trends of food consumption. The suggested system''s examined result is encouraging.
    In [76], the authors proposed the BRUSCHETTA traceability system built on blockchain
    and coupled with IoT that certified the extra virgin olive oil. Data were recorded
    using the suggested system built on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. In Ref. [77],
    the authors proposed the two-stage containerized supply chain using the Hyperledger
    Fabric platform and Proof of Concept as a consensus mechanism. The authors in
    Ref. [78] designed double chain, a public blockchain that provides transparency,
    security, and privacy for an ASC. Furthermore, the authors in Ref. [79] introduced
    a theoretical food traceability system based on blockchain, coupled with IoT,
    and constructed on the Ethereum platform. They utilized a smart contract with
    GS1 message standards to promote transparency in the ASC. The researchers suggested
    a SafeFood solution based on blockchain, integrated with IoT, and developed on
    the Hyperledger platform in Ref. [] [80] to track food products from farm to store.
    Furthermore, in Ref. [81], the authors presented a blockchain-based smart model
    to improve food safety and traceability, increasing consumer trust. The introduced
    model also utilizes a smart contract. In [] [82], the authors proposed a generic
    architecture to explain the granularity levels in the supply chain traceability
    system based on blockchain and IoT. The smart contract minimizes the traceability
    limitations in terms of security, information sharing, and competing interests.
    In [83], the authors proposed AgriBlockIoT as a traceability solution based on
    blockchain and IoT. Data were collected via an IoT sensor. They examined the amount
    of time it took to set a value in the blockchain (latency), the processing power
    of each node (CPU load), and the network consumption in each test. They discovered
    that Hyperledger Sawtooth outperforms Ethereum in terms of performance. Similarly
    [84,85], proposed a traceability system that combines IoT with blockchain. Furthermore,
    in Ref. [85], the authors presented a traceability system based on Ethereum, which
    was useful for constructing DApps. In [86], a blockchain-based traceability system
    with RFID was introduced for the AFSC''s industry. The suggested system gathers
    data and organizes information at each link to improve food safety and quality
    while also increasing transparency within the supply chain network. Furthermore,
    it aids in the reduction of losses throughout the logistics process. The authors
    in Ref. [87] proposed a blockchain-based traceability system that integrates IoT
    with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). The proposed system
    is beneficial in increasing customer openness and confidence. BigchainDB, a new
    database with high throughput, low latency, high capacity, decentralized control,
    immutability, and the creation and movement of digital assets, was introduced
    to address the scalability issue. The authors in Ref. [88] developed a total of
    five models. Regression analysis was used to test three hypotheses about the “Internet+”
    based traceability system. The report claimed that “Internet+” big data, big technologies,
    and big platforms can significantly impact product traceability in an ASC and
    that blockchain can help determine the origin of agricultural products to improve
    quality and safety. In [89], the authors proposed a traceability system based
    on blockchain and IoT to track eggs from Bytable Inc. in the Midwest of the United
    States using Proof of Concept as a consensus method. The suggested method delivers
    critical product information to consumers while also increasing transparency inside
    the supply chain. The researchers developed a blockchain-enabled rice supply chain
    management (RSCM) architecture for the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in Ref.
    [90]. Under this architecture, if necessary, rice stock from a batch can be easily
    recalled. It uses an immutable digital platform to store data, making RSCM more
    transparent and efficient. In [91,92], the researchers presented a decentralized
    food traceability system based on blockchain and the Electronic Product Code (EPC)
    Information System. To avoid the data explosion problem, this system uses blockchain
    to keep traceability information on-chain. At the same time, other food-related
    data are saved off-chain using EPC, and an enterprise-level smart contract is
    employed to secure critical business information. In Refs. [93,94] agri-food was
    tracked and traced using BT, RFID, and IoT. In [94], the authors used Proof of
    Object as a consensus technique in the proposed system. According to security
    analysis, the number of bogus blocks validated reduces as the number of participants’
    nodes increases within the network. The author of [95] suggested a blockchain-based
    traceability system with IoT integration for the seafood supply chain. The authors
    in Ref. [96] presented a blockchain-based traceability system that is connected
    to IoT and includes an RFID sensor. At every stage of the supply chain, food packages
    are scanned. The data are stored in the blockchain under this system after network
    participants reach a consensus. Food Safety Quick Response Block (FoodSQRBlock),
    a blockchain-based system suggested in Ref. [97], digitizes food production information
    in QR codes and makes verification easy for customers and producers. They used
    Google Cloud Platform to construct FoodSQRBlock to replicate a food production
    scenario using milk and pumpkins as examples from genuine farms in the UK. The
    results of the experiment suggested that the proposed framework is practical and
    scalable. The key challenges in the e-commerce market include monopoly, duplicate
    products, and uncertainty. PRODCHAIN, a blockchain-based solution, was discussed
    by the authors in Ref. [98]. They established “Proof of Accomplishment,” a consensus
    process based on ratings. PRODCHAIN allows data to be traced from the development
    of a product through its use. The experiment and analysis were carried out on
    the Ethereum network. In [99], the authors introduced a revolutionary information
    storage architecture based on the Hyperledger blockchain which included visualization
    technology. The food safety hazards of unqualified detection data can be statistically
    examined on this platform, and a food safety risk assessment model based on failure
    rate and qualification deviation can be constructed. Visual tools such as heat
    maps were used in risk analysis to highlight where unqualified products appeared,
    and a migration map and a force-directed graph were utilized to track these items.
    Furthermore, the food sample data for the year of 2016 were used as the experimental
    data for testing the method''s validity. As an example, a case study involving
    aquatic items was investigated, with the results demonstrating the risks intuitively.
    The authors in Ref. [100] addressed an ancient problem of agricultural product
    quality and delivery from farmers to consumers. They proposed that small farmers
    can use blockchain to promote transparency, security, and confidence in agricultural
    product transactions. The authors in Ref. [101] proposed a smart contract based
    blockchain to enable transparent and auditable traceability for the Italian Carasau
    bread supply chain. They concluded that each supply chain actor can demonstrate
    the superiority of products along the chain and reassure customers about the products’
    appropriateness for consumption. The study in Ref. [102] provided a conceptual
    framework for increasing food safety trust during food transactions. They looked
    at China''s food trade with the European Union as an item. The conceptual framework
    was created to make use of an existing traceability system already in place at
    both locations. The approaches of on-chain and off-chain data storage were both
    recommended. A blockchain network was also used to deploy the smart contract.

    Method – – – 4.1.2. Finance According to the study [103], research papers related
    to blockchain integrated with IoT focused primarily on food quality, safety, transparency,
    and data privacy. The development of a well-organized agricultural marketing system
    has the potential to improve farmers’ economic conditions. In Ref. [104], the
    authors introduced a conceptual framework based on blockchain that uses the Ethereum
    platform and smart contracts to address the issue of low returns for Indian farmers.
    The authors in Ref. [105] argued that blockchain-based systems stimulate fair
    trade and reduce management expenses in the context of small and medium firms
    in Denmark. However, due to complexity and lack of understanding of blockchain,
    its adoption on a large scale is still in its infancy. In [106], the authors presented
    a mechanism for integrating blockchain into the existing AFSC to improve environmental
    and social sustainability without limiting economic sustainability. In [107],
    the authors explored investment decisions and coordination in a green agri-food
    supply chain with information services based on blockchain and big data, as well
    as an appropriate supply chain architecture in the fusion application environment.
    The results of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis showed that blockchain
    is a key technology for creating an efficient supply chain. Fair trading and a
    circular economy are achieved by the proposed theoretical model of public blockchain
    produced on the Ethereum platform [108]. In [109], the authors presented a case
    study of Devoleum, a start-up in the agri-food sector that has yet to be institutionalized.
    The CAOS (Characteristic, Ambience, Organization, Start-up) model was used to
    conduct the research. The findings showed that blockchain ensures transparency,
    traceability, security, and unchangeable data throughout the network. The researchers
    in Ref. [110] concluded that blockchain adoption in grains industry could boost
    production. They arrived at this conclusion by using computable general equilibrium
    (CGE) simulation modeling, which showed that introducing blockchain in grains
    and finance sectors might boost Australian gross domestic product (GDP) by . The
    author proposed “KHET,” a decentralized platform built on blockchain, to promote
    traditional farming in Ref. [111]. Ethereum blockchain network was employed in
    the proposed platform. As the proposed approach eliminates the need for a third
    party between farmers and the market, producers can now sell their crops at the
    price they want. Moreover, the authors in Ref. [112] proposed a blockchain-based
    model built on the Hyperledger framework to limit the participation of the middle
    man. As a result, farmers’ income is maximized. Three aspects were considered
    in this model: cost, quality, and source. The authors in Ref. [113] proposed a
    blockchain-based traceability system for an ASC built on the Ethereum platform.
    Smart contracts were utilized at various levels in this system to verify that
    all pre-determined requirements were met before progressing to transactions. This
    technology provides security, dependability, trust, and transparency. It makes
    transactions and administrative procedures easier. Farmers are given a fair chance
    to quote a price utilizing smart contracts. According to a study published in
    Ref. [114], blockchain can greatly improve the international trade supply chain.
    Blockchain''s data integrity and traceability properties aid customs authorities
    in ensuring the safety of local society and the economy. In the context of India,
    the researchers in Ref. [115] proposed a blockchain, information and communication
    technologies (ICT), and big data analytics architecture for the next generation
    agriculture marketing system. The authors in Ref. [116] proposed a blockchain-based
    FSC architecture to eliminate the need for a middleman in FSCs. Data were collected
    at each level of the proposed design using an IoT sensor. The study showed that
    consumers can examine the acquired data to determine whether or not they wish
    to buy, and warehouses can better manage their inventory. In [117], the authors
    presented “Provider-Consumer Network,” a generic end-to-end theoretical food traceability
    application, to simply boost transparency by efficiently delivering distributed
    ledger to every consumer within the network. The presented application was created
    using a smart contract on the Ethereum platform. Further, it was shown to have
    the potential of reducing corruption and boosting the country''s economy. The
    researchers offered various theories to change the AFSC management using modern
    institutional economics, behavioral economics, and management in their work [118].
    They presented two case studies from China that demonstrated how their suggested
    blockchain-based system can disrupt agri-food supply chain management. The authors
    in Ref. [119] conducted a thorough investigation into the influence of blockchain
    on the performance of lemon and orange supply chains. According to the findings,
    blockchain has a favorable impact on investment return, food quality, and communication
    between stages of a supply chain. The summary of the above-discussed papers is
    given in Table 2. Table 2. Summary of articles related to finance. References

    Study – – – 4.1.3. Logistics Blockchain has the potential to transform the logistics
    of food businesses. However, to ensure the widespread use of blockchain in food
    logistics, it is critical to standardize data collection, representation, and
    storage mechanisms to ensure that any negative effects on consumers are minimized
    [120]. In [121], the authors proposed a solution based on blockchain and smart
    contracts to provide security, integrity, and reliability for the logistics industry.
    They put the model to the test for two real-world scenarios: (1) to identify food
    product ingredients and (2) to track them from the manufacturer to the client.
    Further, the solution demonstrated the transport''s transparency and authentication.
    In [122], the authors presented a broad technique for developing blockchain use
    cases. They analyzed the results of a fresh food delivery use case and concluded
    that blockchain can play a key role in lowering logistic costs. Based on ten logistics
    sector applications, the authors in Ref. [123] proposed an explanatory model for
    coordinating with actors in a blockchain-enabled operation supply chain. Their
    investigation was based on a compilation of use cases that represent a small part
    of a larger logistics business with many diverse participants all over the world.
    According to this study, blockchain is extremely effective, and it has the potential
    to help firms make permanent changes to their business models. The Carbon Footprint
    Chain (CFC), first introduced in Ref. [124], is a cluster-based architecture.
    It is a lightweight distributed system that tracks the carbon footprint of food
    as it moves from one step to the next. It consists of six clusters, each representing
    a stage in the food life-cycle, and uses a Raft-like consensus method. The block
    keeps track of transactions as the food moves from one stage to the other. Each
    block comprises information on products moved, carbon footprint, mileage, and
    preceding cluster information, among other things. The summary of the above-discussed
    papers is given in Table 3. Table 3. Summary of articles related to logistics.

    a sustainable and digital marketing based e-agricultural supply chain model based
    on web-design features employing blockchain to create a solid and sustainable
    platform for attracting buyers to agricultural products. It also ensures that
    such products are traceable, secure, and delivered on time. The proposed model
    was tested in a real-time industrial setting, with five different scenarios based
    on mutual share, demand curve, and e-advertisement budget. The scenario in which
    the partners split the appropriate e-advertisement cost for digital marketing
    yielded the greatest profit for the supply chain management (SCM). A reduction
    in transportation and third-party logistics participation lowers the selling price
    of agricultural products compared to traditional SCM. The study in Ref. [126]
    identified and established linkages between blockchain and an Indian AFSC. Anonymity
    and privacy, auditability, decentralized database, immutability, enhanced risk
    management, provenance, decreased transaction costs, reduced settlement lead times,
    secured database, smart contracts, traceability, and transparency were among the
    thirteen enablers identified in the this literature. They used a combination of
    Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Decision-making Trial and Evaluation
    Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to assess these enablers. The following are the
    most important enablers out of the total: traceability, auditability, immutability,
    and provenance. The authors in Ref. [127] used a technology assessment framework
    to look at six cases of companies: FairChain, IBM Food Trust, OpenSC, Provenance,
    TE-FOOD, and WWF pilot blockchain-based technologies for the FSC using four criteria:
    technique, knowledge, organization, and product. This research provided a thorough
    understanding of the role of blockchains in the field of FSC. The authors in Ref.
    [128] proposed a blockchain-based framework for securing food data storage origin
    provenance. The suggested platform is based on the Ethereum platform. The proposed
    platform ensures openness, encourages the use of native Sardinia products, and
    promotes their smart tourism as well. The authors investigated the integration
    of blockchain with the precision irrigation (PI) environment in Ref. [129]. PI
    is the use of sensors and network units to make the best use of irrigation resources.
    It is a good way to manage the scarcity of critical resources, including food,
    water, land, and crop yields. Meanwhile, the internet is an open channel for receiving
    precise readings from sensor units. As a result, malevolent intruders have the
    potential to assault PI-sensors. According to the research, combining PI with
    blockchain improves efficiency, robustness, trust, and security. In [130], the
    authors proposed a water control system to monitor and coordinate water consumption
    among villages being irrigated. Blockchain was used to help members of a community
    build trust. The proposed system''s implementation and evaluation were also discussed.
    The authors in Ref. [131] proposed an intelligent smart watering system based
    on IoT, blockchain, and fuzzy logic. This system is made up of various sensors
    that record plant and environmental data in real-time. Blockchain provides security,
    scalability, privacy, and dependability, while fuzzy logic aids in decision-making
    regarding watering requirements. The researchers in Ref. [132], a secondary source
    of data and questionnaires, conducted interviews with diverse cocoa producers
    to explore the role of blockchain in addressing issues, such as child labor and
    deforestation. In [133], the authors proposed a blockchain-based reputation system
    for an AFSC to maintain the integrity of trading entities and product quality
    ratings. According to simulation results, the suggested system requires a specific
    amount of time to mine the transaction. To improve the ledger efficiency of a
    vegetable supply chain, the authors in Ref. [134] constructed a blockchain framework
    on Hyperledger Fabric with nine channels and crash fault-tolerant by using Apache
    Kafka. The Repelling and Notifying System, a blockchain-based architecture combined
    with an IoT preventive system, was proposed in Ref. [135] to safeguard crops against
    animal assault at all stages of harvest. The efficiency of the sensors can be
    seen by adjusting them using tree-topology, experimental, and simulation findings.
    Up-to-date data delivery, adequate multi-hop connectivity, data transfer security,
    and low cost are the primary aspects of the proposed system that make it useful
    in developing nations. In agriculture, IoT-based greenhouse technology is currently
    employed for remote control. As it is a new technology, security and privacy are
    major concerns. In Ref. [136], the authors proposed a blockchain-based, lightweight
    framework for smart greenhouse farms to overcome the aforementioned concerns.
    It creates a standard platform for securely transmitting data across a distributed
    network. The authors in Ref. [137] depicted the basic design of the functional
    and non-functional architecture of a decentralized app for various food courts,
    together with a specific user interface design (UI). Restaurant personnel can
    organize their online menu and keep track of their customers’ orders, while customers
    can order food from anywhere. The authors in Ref. [138] proposed the restaurant
    model, which utilizes product identifiers to improve food traceability. The suggested
    model gathers data and uses the Food Quality Index (FQI) algorithm to provide
    an FQI value that can be used to judge whether or not the food is edible. As consumers
    prefer an online inquiry over an offline order, this is a growing trend. Customers
    can browse a food menu from anywhere utilizing food court web design and cellular-based
    apps, and shops can deliver food orders on time. In [139], the authors proposed
    an intelligent fruit juice monitoring system with high automation and reliability.
    This monitoring system was built on a smart contract and evaluation model. A smart
    contract was used to record production data on a blockchain, and the evaluation
    model was utilized as input. The traceability of blockchain transactions and the
    automatic execution of smart contracts aid in the achievement of dependable and
    efficient quality control. The authors in Ref. [140] proposed a credit evaluation
    system. A smart contract collected credit ratings from traders, and the text was
    analyzed using a deep learning approach called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
    The experimental results showed that using LSTM for credit evaluation is superior
    to using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Nave Bayes (NB) for credit evaluation.
    To defend the rights of temporary workers, researchers proposed a blockchain-based
    D-ES (Decentralized Employment System) in Ref. [141]. In addition, a case study
    on temporary work in the agriculture industry was conducted. The researchers presented
    a detailed summary of blockchain technology legislation and regulations in Ref.
    [142]. The authors in Ref. [143] used a rating-based conjoint analysis to identify
    some potential drivers of blockchain adoption using a grape wine supply chain
    as an object. The study revealed that disintermediation, traceability, trust,
    price, compliance, and coordination are all factors that influence blockchain
    adoption. Researchers working collaboratively on vegetable-based product face
    the difficulties related to information traceability and transparency in results.
    The authors in Ref. [144] proposed blockchain-based architecture that provides
    a decentralized storage location for all information and uses smart contracts
    to address these issues. The traceability system''s architecture varies depending
    on geography, culture, and product. To standardize the traditional traceability
    method, blockchain and AI are now available. The EU and China have established
    significant commercial ties that will definitely benefit both economies in the
    coming years. Adopting a uniform traceability system is a necessary foundation
    for the long-term viability of these trade ties [145]. A typical blockchain contains
    all data in one file, which leads to delayed transmission and parsing of the blockchain
    data file as the file size grows. To address this issue, the authors presented
    in Ref. [146] an efficient and secure storage framework based on an enhanced blockchain,
    which is a secure storage architecture for high-throughput crop breeding data
    based on the blockchain technology (SACBDIBT). In [147], the author used a methodology
    based on interpretative structural modeling (ISM) coupled with fuzzy-decision-making
    trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) to build a sustainable AFSC managed
    with technologies, such as IoT blockchain, robotics, and big data. Information
    processing theory (IPT) and dynamical capabilities theory (DPT) were used to identify
    14 enablers of an IoT-based multi-tier sustainable food security system. ISM and
    F-DEMATEL were, then, used to evaluate these enablers. The results showed that
    the 13th enabler (cold chain for perishable items) was the first, and the 14th
    enabler (sustainable-based competitive ASC) was the last. Route optimization and
    replicating the consumption pattern were also the most sensitive facilitators,
    according to the findings. The summary of the above-discussed papers is given
    in Table 4. Table 4. Summary of articles related to Miscellaneous. References

    Factor Description References Transaction Throughput Refers to the maximum number
    of transactions a protocol can handle in a single second. [152,153] Computational
    Energy Indicates whether the algorithm or the employing system uses a lot of energy
    to mine blocks. The special high-end hardware consumes more energy, resulting
    in higher consumption costs. [17,20] Cost Refers to the entire cost of confirming
    a transaction in a blockchain. [20,143,152] 4.2. Challenges and suggestions for
    improving the performance of blockchain technology In this section, the current
    challenges in this field are discussed, along with the potential solutions provided
    by researchers for blockchain adoption in FSCs. 4.2.1. Challenges The applicability
    and significance of blockchain in FSCs is quite clear in increasing traceability,
    maintaining transparency, and in generating confidence amongst providers, farmers,
    suppliers, retailers, and consumers. However, blockchain is currently in a nascent
    stage of development and has to face certain barriers that hinder its adoption
    in FSCs, as pointed out by several researchers [12,[148], [154], [155], [156],
    [157]]. Most researchers have discussed four main challenges pertaining to blockchain
    adoption, which are scalability, interoperability, security and privacy, and data
    authentication. These are discussed in the subsequent subsections. • Scalability:
    Issues related to scalability occur in blockchains as block sizes grow larger
    leading to adverse effects on factors, like transaction throughput, computational
    energy, and cost. This has been considered as a major challenge by the blockchain
    research community [13,39,47,55,[148], [149], [150]]. Factors related to scalability,
    their description, and the corresponding references are given in Table 5. • Interoperability:
    Interoperability refers to the capacity of blockchains to share and communicate
    with one another. Currently, many blockchain projects, written in different programming
    languages on different platforms, are active. Due to lack of interoperability,
    different blockchain networks are unable to connect with one another, resulting
    in network isolation and information asymmetry. Therefore a novel interoperable
    communication protocol should be proposed [17,20]. • Security and privacy: Blockchain
    technology provides immutable data storage, decentralized network, and peer-to-peer
    communication which enhances security and privacy. However, currently blockchain
    technology is becoming a target for hackers, who can launch cyber-attacks from
    the protocol side, implementation side, and there could be logical defects as
    well [17,148]. • Data Authentication: Sensors are still heavily used in blockchain
    technology to capture raw data. Blockchains do not have a verification mechanism
    to establish whether the raw data are legitimate or not, despite the fact that
    the data remain immutable [151]. Besides the above-mentioned limitations of blockchain,
    some other problems pointed out by researchers are as follows: • The researchers
    in Ref. [158] identified a potential assault known as the “Hilt Shao Attack,”
    which might occur at the early stages of product registration and demonstrated
    it as a sort of attack employing unique identification (UID) and unique changeable
    identification (CUID) tags. • In the Indian context, researchers in Ref. [159]
    pointed out ten major hurdles in blockchain adoption in AFSCs. These barriers
    were modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL technique, in which ISM assessed
    the interrelationships between the identified constructs and DEMATEL looked at
    the severity of the link. The findings revealed that the most significant challenges
    to blockchain adoption in AFSCs are “lack of government regulation” and “lack
    of confidence among agro stakeholders.” In addition, security, privacy concerns,
    and a lack of blockchain awareness are other major hurdles. 4.2.2. Potential solutions
    • As the majority of people are unaware of blockchain technology, its global implementation
    is infeasible. Therefore, many trials should be conducted to remove demerits before
    blockchain is implemented in FSCs [150]. • The author of [160] proposed LC4IoT
    with lightweight consensus to address sufficient processing power and significant
    delay issues. Extensive simulations were used to test this newly incorporated
    consensus. • In Ref. [161], the authors suggested a prominent architecture based
    on the Ethereum platform. The proposed architecture is useful for auditing and
    tracking the food processing industry because it aggregates data time-to-time.
    After incorporating blockchain into AFSCs, the trial findings suggested its little
    impact on consumer prices. However, as we proceeded further, down the supply chain
    ecosystem, operating costs increased. • The researchers in Ref. [144] devised
    a traceability system based on blockchain to tackle the issues related to scalability,
    throughput, access control, and data retrieval. • To overhaul the current logistics
    system, the researchers in Ref. [162] proposed a system based on blockchain. The
    suggested approach eliminates intermediaries, improves security, reduces distribution
    delays, and provides efficient AFSCs by utilizing a smart contract and multi-agent
    system (MAS). • A framework proposed in Ref. [163] addresses two issues: business
    privacy and determining whether or not data need to be stored on a blockchain.
    As a result, it is useful to associate the dimensions of data attributes (static
    or dynamic) and data requirements with blockchain dataflow items (mandatory or
    optional). It also included a dataflow reference model for stakeholders along
    AFSCs and a dataflow matrix for analyzing stakeholders'' access rights to traceable
    food data. • To address the “last mile” problem, the authors in Ref. [164] used
    videogrammetry to capture product lifecycle data on a digital blockchain. According
    to this study, data verification in a blockchain can be done by using videogrammetry,
    RFID sensors, and fingerprint sensors. • Physical food products are represented
    digitally in the universal blockchain-based system proposed in Ref. [165]. The
    authors utilized ordinary and thermal pictures for training machine-learning models
    on visual aspects of food products. The study also proposed a way to reward supply
    chain ecosystem actors who encourage honesty and data sharing. • The study in
    Ref. [166] specified 18 boundary constraints for exchanging assertion information
    to improve AFSC traceability. Regulation, traceability, quality, and business
    were the four types of boundary conditions. The findings demonstrated that altering
    the supply chain system and institutional measures can increase traceability if
    the boundary requirements are met. • There are several types of blockchains and
    consensus mechanisms to choose from. It is not easy to determine which blockchain
    and consensus mechanism are best for a given application. The authors in Ref.
    [156] proposed a blockchain applicability framework (BAF) to address these concerns.
    5. Bibliometric analysis Bibliometric analysis is a statistical evaluation of
    published scientific articles, books, surveys and book chapters, in which qualitative
    conclusions are drawn from figures and values available in published works [167].
    As blockchain is only a decade old and is being adopted by industries other than
    finance, a bibliometric study is required. The distribution of reviewed papers
    based on blockchain''s application in FSCs is shown in Fig. 7. According to it,
    blockchain has most applications in the field of product authentication. As per
    Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, mostly the Ethereum platform employing smart contracts is used
    for applying blockchain in FSCs. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download

    Additionally, the analysis was executed using VoSviewer [168] and Bibliometrix
    R-Tool [169] on the collected 150 articles. VoSviewer is an open-source application
    for creating, visualizing, and exploring network maps [168]. However, Bibliometrix
    is an open-source application written in R that performs a complete science mapping
    analysis of scientific articles. Both these programs are simple to use. Their
    use does not necessitate any prior programming skills. 5.1. Number of scientific
    publications: output analysis The main information regarding data collected from
    the SCOPUS library that is generated in Bibliometric analysis is shown in Table
    6. The number of research papers getting published every year is depicted in Fig.
    10. Since 2018, there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications,
    indicating an upward trend. As demonstrated in Fig. 11, the number of journal
    papers is higher than the number of conference papers, while the number of book
    chapters is the lowest. Table 6. Main information about data collected from the

    in FSCs was published at a conference in 2016. Between 2016 and 2018, conference

    map The most significant themes in the examined field identified using the author''s
    keywords are projected on a two-dimensional thematic map, as shown in Fig. 19.
    This map is divided into four quadrants: Type 1 has a high density and high centrality
    value, Type 2 a low density and high centrality value, Type 3 a high density and
    low centrality value, and Type 4 a low density and low centrality value. Download

    Conceptual thematic map. Of the literature, the study topics in quadrant Type
    1 are considered (motor) mainstream themes. This quadrant contains FSC-related
    and upcoming technology topics, such as food safety, food quality, food integrity,
    blockchain, AI, and machine learning. The Type 2 quadrant contains themes with
    low density and high centrality, which are considered basic themes. As a result,
    there are basic topics related to FSCs with blockchain in this quadrant, such
    as blockchain, traceability, smart contracts, and IoT. The themes considered in
    quadrant Type 3 are high density and low centrality, called niche themes. Supply
    chain management and consensus mechanisms are included under this type. Finally,
    quadrant Type 4 includes issues with low density and low centrality, which are
    referred to as nascent or underdeveloped. The themes under this category are emerging
    themes; AFSC is the key topic in this cluster. Section 4''s extensive study shows
    that AFSC needs additional attention now. 5.3. Science mapping analysis In this
    section, we discuss how authors, countries, documents, and sources are linked
    in the bibliography. There also exist a co-citation network analysis for the authors,
    sources, and references, and a keyword co-occurrence analysis. The goal of the
    mapping analysis is to determine the research pattern in this emerging topic and
    provide a feasible future research path. 5.3. Bibliographic Coupling Analysis
    Two articles are bibliographically coupled if at least one cited source appears
    in both references lists [170]. The network visualization of bibliographic coupling
    is shown in Fig. 20, which considers articles with at least ten citations. In
    the figure, a node symbolizes an article, its size denotes the number of citations,
    and a link represents bibliographic couplings. The results of the bibliographic
    coupling analysis are summarized in Table 13. Download : Download high-res image

    the article titled “An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based
    on RFID & blockchain technology” [86] has the most citations (461). “Applying
    blockchain technology to improve agri-food traceability: A review of development
    methods, benefits and challenges” [154] is the article with the greatest link
    strength value of “151.” 5.3.2. Co-citation analysis When two articles are cited
    in the same article, it is known as co-citation. Co-citation analysis is, thus,
    the antithesis of bibliographic coupling. The network visualization of the co-citation
    analysis of authors is shown in Fig. 21, which considers authors with at least
    ten citations. A node represents an author, its size denotes an author''s citations,
    and a connection symbolizes a co-citation. Similarly, Fig. 22 depicts the network
    visualization of source co-citation analysis taking into account sources with
    at least ten citations. A node represents a source, its size denotes the source''s
    citation, and a link shows co-citation. Table 14 summarizes the result of the
    co-citation analysis. Tian, F. is the author with maximum “107” co-citations.
    The journal “Food Control” has maximum co-citations (160 citations). Download

    Co-word analysis The co-word analysis attempts to uncover the conceptual structure
    by using a “word co-occurrence network” to map and cluster the terms collected
    from keywords in a bibliographic collection. The keyword network is depicted in
    Fig. 23, which comprises keywords that appeared in at least three articles. A
    thick line denotes a close relationship between two items, and a node''s size
    denotes their frequency. Table 15 presents a summary of the findings. Download

    safety (40 occurrences, link strength 310). 6. Discussion The focus of this research
    was on blockchain in FSCs. To better understand the applicability, challenges,
    solutions, and current research trends, this study conducted a complete literature
    review and bibliometric analysis of 150 papers relevant to blockchain in FSCs.
    After data were collected from the SCOPUS database, the selected articles were
    grouped according to four relevant applications of blockchain in FSCs, namely
    product authentication, finance, logistics, and miscellaneous. We addressed three
    research questions in this paper. The RQ1 focused on blockchain''s role in alleviating
    the burden on the global FSC due to population growth. Traditional FSCs are under
    tremendous strain as a result of the expanding population. After a thorough investigation,
    the authors discovered that blockchain is a well-known technology that has the
    potential to transform FSCs into a decentralized system that improves transparency
    and traceability while lowering the risk of food fraud and information asymmetry.
    Food safety, food integrity, food quality, optimizing trade supply chains, improving
    the inventory, ensuring farmers receive a fair price for their crops, building
    economic sustainability, reducing logistics costs, tracking carbon footprint during
    food transportation, and smartly scheduling watering are all benefits of the blockchain-based
    framework. The RQ2 was focused on potential solutions given by the researchers
    and the current challenges for integrating blockchain in FSCs. While blockchain
    enables decentralized and traceable FSCs, there are several impediments to its
    implementation, including scalability, high cost, high energy consumption, interoperability,
    data authenticity, lack of understanding, privacy, sensitive data handling, and
    technological aspects. Many trials should be conducted to eliminate these limitations
    and improve the use of blockchain in FSCs. Blockchain integrated with sensors,
    like IoT, RFID, and NFC, for data capturing, can be useful to remove false data
    entries. The RQ3 was addressed by the bibliometric analysis of all collected research
    papers to examine the current research trend. The year-by-year trend of the reviewed
    publications revealed a significant increase in publications in recent years,
    indicating a growing interest in this area among academics and researchers. A
    conceptual thematic map and a science mapping analysis are also provided. 7. Conclusions
    and future scope The objective of this study was to analyze the implementation
    of blockchain in FSCs through an extensive literature survey and bibliometric
    analysis, carried out using the VoSviewer software and the Bibliometrix R-Tool.
    For this purpose, 150 publications from the Scopus International database were
    collected through specific keywords. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first study to explore blockchain''s application in FSCs, highlight solutions
    provided by researchers for its successful implementation, and discuss the current
    challenges. Concluding remarks based on the current study are as follows: • Application
    of blockchain in the domain of FSCs appears to be a promising area and has immense
    scope in terms of theoretical as well as practical implementation. Blockchain
    is likely to become a dominant technology for enhancing transparency and traceability,
    reducing risk and, most importantly, enhancing trust among different stakeholders.
    • In a short span of 5–6 years, blockchain has generated considerable interest
    among researchers for its applicability in the domain of FSC, which is evident
    from 150 research papers considered in this study. The growing interest in blockchain
    is also apparent from the fact that research in this field is published in high
    quality journals. As many as 25 journals belonging to Q1 category were identified
    during this study, which published papers related to the implementation of blockchain
    in FSCs. • If we look at the number of researchers country wise, then China has
    the highest number of researchers working in this area, followed by India and
    Italy. Researchers have mostly focused on the applicability of blockchain for
    product authentication, finance, and logistics. • In hindsight, we think that
    most work done with regard to blockchain''s application in FSCs is in the conceptual
    phase and requires proper set-up (including hardware and software facilities)
    for its implementation. Some of the key barriers that deter the implementation
    of this technology, as pointed out by various researchers, include scalability,
    privacy, interoperability, and high cost. 7.1. Future scope and limitations •
    Blockchain is mainly utilized for traceability and transparency in FSCs; however,
    research in the area of application of blockchain from the viewpoint of increasing
    farmers'' income is lacking. This is an interesting area of research which can
    be explored by researchers. • Success of blockchain depends on data that are legitimate
    and requires the development of a sophisticated framework based on sensors, such
    as RFID, IoT, and NFC. Development of such dependable frameworks is the need of
    the hour for a successful blockchain implementation. • Some other issues that
    need research attention are scalability, privacy, and interoperability. • Designing
    a new consensus mechanism that does not necessitate a lot of computing power is
    also an open research domain. In this work, the authors have tried to touch all
    the important aspects of implementation of blockchain technology in the domain
    of FSCs; however, one limitation the paper has is the lack of a detailed study
    on the performance analysis for different blockchain models. This can be taken
    up as a future task when more reports and articles are available in this area.
    It is also pertinent to mention that although the authors made every effort to
    include all necessary references; yet, it is possible that an essential reference
    was overlooked, for which the authors apologize. Authorship contributions Vivekanand

    is one of the significant fields in the world, affecting all human existence.
    Agriculture production is substantial for a nation’s economy along with the security,
    nutrition, and health of its populace. Agriculture practice involves a lot of
    choices and vulnerabilities such as weather remains changing from season to season,
    the market price of agriculture products keeps fluctuating, degrading soil quality,
    not sustainable crops, weeds and pests harm produce, and global climate change.
    In the agriculture supply chain, big data analytics might be employed to analyze
    the food quality, storage conditions, weather patterns in a particular geographic
    area, soil quality such as pH and nutrients, marketing and trade management, and
    the existence of food hazards by relating biotic or abiotic data with development
    and probabilistic existence of pathogens, pests, and toxicants. It can also be
    used for determining the behavior of customers and inventory management. Thus,
    it offers a prospect to utilize the data by abiding by the scientific methods
    and making efficient decisions at right time. To utilize agricultural big data
    a holistic approach involving several relevant technologies and data of various
    related sectors is required. Researchers, legislators, farmers, and other stakeholders
    can utilize agricultural big data for research, policymaking, decision making,
    crop management, and business management [1]. Figure 1 represents the characteristics
    of blockchain, IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data for the agricultural
    sector. To keep up with such uncertainties farmers need to change their practicing
    approaches. Figure 1. Characteristics of blockchain, AI, IoT, and big data for
    smart farming. Farmers, processing factories, distributors, retailers, and consumers
    are all part of the complicated food supply chain involving many stakeholders.
    All food processing enterprises and supply chains must now provide safe food as
    a crucial and legally defined need. CAC/GL 60–2006 lays forth the basics of food
    traceability [2]: as acceptable to the targets of the food testing and enforcement
    scheme, the traceability/product tracking solution must be able to distinguish
    at any given stage of the food supply chain (from the production process to retailing)
    from where the food came (one step back) and where the food went (one step forward)
    from where the food came (one step back) and where the food went (one step forward).
    National and international regulations support the implementation of these concepts
    (see, for example, European Union (EU) Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 and national
    methods assessed by Charlebois et al. [3]. Because all actors know who their suppliers
    are and where their product is sold, this pragmatic one up/one down system connects
    all tied supply chain participants. However, because many food items have complicated
    multistep vertical and horizontal branching supply networks, relying on the one
    up/one down strategy makes the supply chain susceptible (e.g., multiple ingredient
    products). Furthermore, with commodity items that are blended (e.g., milk from
    several farms in a dairy) or dissected and mixed across the supply chain, one
    up/one down traceability can be easily lost (e.g., animals for meat production).
    With this level of intricacy, verifying the provenance and quality requirements
    of individual items becomes nearly difficult. Furthermore, the food sector continues
    to rely heavily on paper records, and the present food traceability systems are
    not integrated nor linked across all participants in the supply chain. This isolation
    creates a negative information imbalance among all supply chain stakeholders,
    a lack of transparency across numerous supply chain processes, and the potential
    for fraud to be promoted or concealed. Although several technologies for product
    traceability have previously been employed, such as bar codes, RFID tags, and
    Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Bosnia and Gebresenbet [4] stated that more
    technical applications for food supply chain traceability are needed. Moreover,
    existing IoT-based tracking and provenance systems for agri-supply chains are
    layered on top of centralized structures, leaving an opportunity for unresolved
    issues and key concerns such as data integrity, manipulation, and single points
    of failure. In reality, obtaining verified and confidential data in a supply chain
    is difficult because it necessitates a high degree of confidence between cooperating
    parties, and trust necessitates the development of a specific quantity of verified
    and communicated information [5]. Although scholars and practitioners believe
    that somehow a third party is required in the chain to ensure information quality
    and security, the incentive for supply chain stakeholders to increase transparency
    in the agri-supply chain varies [6]. In this way, blockchain may operate as a
    decentralized certificate authority, verifying transactions, and delivering tamper-proof
    cryptographic information to any point in the chain upon demand. Globally known
    food companies have begun to collaborate to accelerate the implementation of distributed
    ledger technology in agri-food supply chains, and early prototype models are emerging.
    Novel design concepts for such a system have been offered in the literature. Globally
    known food companies have begun to collaborate to accelerate the implementation
    of distributed ledger technology in agri-food supply chains, and early prototype
    models are emerging. Novel design concepts for such a system have been offered
    in the literature. In this context, researchers have begun to implement blockchain-enabled
    supply chain product traceability models [7,8,9,10,11,12], however, preliminary
    findings are only accessible for latency, network traffic, and CPU load. Tian
    [13] has recently expanded the initial application to real-time food monitoring
    based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), however widespread
    adoption of blockchain technology in the food processing sector and supply chain
    is difficult and may face several problems [9]. On the other hand, by far most
    of the existing logistic information systems in Agri-Food supply chains like Costco,
    Walmart, Cargill, Albert Heijn, etc., just store, track orders, and supplies,
    without giving characteristics such as transparency, auditability, and traceability.
    These characteristics in an agri-food supply chain will certainly improve the
    food quality and safety, thus are in demand from consumers. Therefore, numerous
    R&D communities both in industries and academia have engaged their efforts in
    developing efficient food chain traceability systems based on emerging technologies
    like the IoT and blockchain technologies, to facilitate remote monitoring at every
    stage all along the supply chain, from farm to fork. The above-mentioned companies
    have recently started experiments with blockchain for their supply chains. The
    contributions of this paper can be summarized as: (i) we performed a comprehensive
    study of the state-of-art of IoT and blockchain technologies in agri-food supply
    chain and highlighted the prospective applications of these technologies, (ii)
    we identified and provided a comprehensive discussion on different research challenges
    of agriculture supply chain alongside the IoT security problems and existing defense
    mechanisms, (iii) we also presented the application of IoT and blockchain in different
    domains of agriculture sector such as food composition, quality, safety monitoring,
    food supply traceability, and farm and food waste management, (iv) we have also
    given the special consideration to security and implementation challenges of these
    technologies and smart contracts in blockchain-based agriculture sector, and (v)
    finally, we introduced a new blockchain-based Agri-SCM-IoT architecture to solve
    storage, security, and some other challenges in the agriculture supply chain along
    with the necessity of interoperability among blockchain platforms to solve scalability
    and growing blockchain ledger size. Though there are several reviews [14,15,16,17,18]
    that focus on IoT and blockchain-based food supply chain management, to the best
    of our knowledge, no work has discussed the interoperability between different
    blockchain platforms and the ever-increasing nature of ledge size affecting the
    scalability of the single-chain based supply chain systems. This work presents
    a systematic literature review of blockchain, IoT, and AI technologies in agri-supply
    chain applications contributing to the existing literature of these three technologies
    by identifying the singularity of individual technological usage and accumulating
    a thorough understanding of the relationship among these technologies. Moreover,
    we exhibit the potential research directions to conduct comparative examinations
    of these technologies in agri-supply chain management and investigate interactive
    factors reported in the existing literature. This paper covers both technical
    and applicative characteristics in such a way that our intuitions can be applied
    for cross-blockchain agri-supply chain scenarios. 2. Related Work To effectively
    manage the supply chain, and thus the human behaviors it includes, all stakeholders
    must agree on the information to be recorded on the blockchain, from raw materials
    to finished goods. The fundamental objective is to choose the information that
    is useful to all areas of the supply chain, with a particular focus on customer
    needs and applicable standards blockchain may be utilized as a marketing technique
    along with operating as a traceability system. Blockchains may be used to improve
    a company’s image and reputation [19], promote loyalty among existing consumers
    [20], and bring new clients since they are entirely transparent [21] and participants
    can manage the items in them. In reality, organizations may simply set themselves
    apart from rivals by stressing product flow transparency and monitoring across
    the supply chain. Furthermore, quickly identifying a source of food contamination
    can boost a company’s brand image [22] and mitigate the negative impact of media
    criticism. With the globalization of business, supply chains are growing more
    complicated, making it more difficult to track things across their intricate webs.
    In reality, stakeholder relationships are frequently complicated. As a result,
    suppliers can be divided into tiers, with a first-tier supplier supplying the
    organization directly with metal cans, for example, and a second-tier supplier
    supplying the raw materials needed to manufacture the cans [23]. Organizations
    sometimes have several suppliers at various levels involved in a single product;
    also, suppliers are frequently non-exclusive to a single firm. Aung and Chang
    [24], as well as Golan [25], have identified three key goals for traceability
    to enhance product-supply chain administration, product differentiation strategies,
    and quality assurance, and improved detection of non-compliant items. Compliance
    with applicable legislation and standards is another factor in ensuring traceability.
    Majority of existing blockchain solutions for traceability management have been
    established based on single chain architecture such as the Fish supply chain [26]
    to decrease the transaction cost and enhance the transaction capacity and make
    system auditable and provide certifications to the product, Wine supply chain
    [27] to improve the performance, revenue, accountability, and security, and implement
    the more secure and secure global transactions, Agri-food supply chain [28] to
    enable quality and certified virtual identity especially for “bio” and DOCG products,
    Agri-food supply chain system [29] to share the authentic data in production,
    processing, distribution, retailer, etc. across the supply chain, Fruit supply
    chain based on public immutable distributed ledger based on decreased variance
    of mining rewards, Pork supply chain [30] to enhance consumer trust by protecting
    the brand and security through transparency, large enterprises supply chain food
    tracking project [31] to integrate the existing systems with the blockchain used
    by various stakeholders, fresh food [32] supply chain to attach the product origin
    data along with sensor data throughout the supply chain with product to enable
    data, and product transfer transparent from farm to fork. Furthermore, the AgriOpenData
    [28] blockchain integrated solution is a cutting-edge digital technology that
    ensures transparent, secure, and public transparency throughout the whole agriculture
    supply chain and in the processing of agricultural goods. This is especially true
    for “bio” and DOCG (Designation of Origin Controlled and Guaranteed) items, which
    may have their quality and virtual identity certified (viz., provenance, ownership,
    seeding, treatments, crop, Internet of Things analysis, processing, storage, and
    delivery). This digitized history of organically cultivated products ensures end-consumer
    legitimacy and improves the agri-food industry’s quality. The variation of mining
    incentives, and thus the necessity for mining pools, maybe significantly minimized
    using some particular FruitChain protocols [33]. For example, in a FruitChain
    with 1000 fruits per block and each fruit taking 80 bytes, allocating memory for
    1000 fruits every block occupies around 8% of a 1 MN block. A solitary miner may
    now get their initial rewards 1000 times quicker (in a day or several rather than
    a few years). Furthermore, DNA samples from an animal may be used to determine
    its breed, but additional data such as country of origin, toxicity exposure, and
    uncontrolled medicine, among other critical factors, can be acquired. To ensure
    the animal’s identity and lifetime, this data may be compared to the blockchain
    record. Dey et al. [12] developed a FoodSQRBlock (Food Safety Quick Response Block)
    supply chain architecture using blockchain and QR codes. They have also proposed
    large-scale cloud integration of the developed system to demonstrate the framework’s
    practicality and scalability, as well as an experimental assessment to back it
    up. Tian et al. [13] proposed a theoretical real-time food traceability system
    using HACCP, blockchain, and IoT. The authors have claimed to achieve transparency,
    reliability, and security with the proposed model but have not provided any experimental
    implementation and evaluation of the system. Leng et al. [9] introduced a double
    chain-based agriculture supply chain architecture using a public blockchain. They
    also study the storage mode, resource rent-seeking, and consensus algorithms but
    have not evaluated the speed and competence of consensus algorithms by considering
    the case for a huge number of nodes and resources on the platform. Moreover, the
    access management for the user needs to be further investigated. Surasak et al.
    [10] presented an IoT-based blockchain traceability system particularly designed
    for Thai agriculture products. Blockchain has been used for creating a distributed
    ledger to increase data integrity and transparency and a structured query language
    (SQL) database has been used to make the platform user-friendly. There is a need
    to further research on the integration of blockchain with the proposed system
    to enhance the security, transparency, and integrity of the system. Dakshayini
    et al. [34] suggested a blockchain, big data, and cloud-integrated crop supervision
    system trying to realize effective demand-based decision support and to achieve
    a simple, auditable, and secure supply chain. The authors have also proposed a
    crop-trading platform to sell the agri-products at different stages. However,
    they have not implemented the IoT-based Blockchain architecture to gather the
    real data from the field parameters and then model the big data-based decision
    support system. They have just used the available data set and implemented a deep
    learning model to predict the demand. 3. Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts in Agri-Supply
    Chain Management Agri-food supply chain system comprises multiple levels of transactions,
    each level with different terms and conditions [35]. Different systems with diverse
    characteristics and functions have collaborated in a supply chain, including food
    processing, transportation, storage, and distributors. All these levels maintain
    a record of all the products from processing to packaging, transportation to storage,
    and distribution, which are very long and complex processes. Smart contracts can
    assist in simplifying the whole process and enhance transparency throughout the
    supply chain. Integrating blockchain-based smart contracts with IoT devices enables
    tracking of the location of goods, allows tracking of inventory, and the change
    of ownership rights across the supply chain. This helps companies to prepare well
    for any disruption or incidents. Besides this, smart contracts enable companies
    and customers to determine the quality of the food products by tracing back all
    the information. The characteristics of smart contracts [36] enable their use
    in diverse applications or domains. Several of such characteristics are acquired
    from the core blockchain technology. Table 1. shows the categorization of the
    key characteristics of smart contact characteristics. Figure 2. represents the
    typical structure of blockchain smart contract system having various functional
    blocks like user management and service management modules manages the user accounts,
    services, and smart contracts, business network module agent, API’s are used to
    provide an interface for external components, and virtual blockchain platform
    (such as Ethereum virtual machine) is used to deploy, implement, and supervise
    the smart contract state machine, etc., in the contract run time once all parties
    have signed the contract. The smart contract terms and conditions of the smart
    contract are enforced dynamically depending on the real-time data from various
    distributed sources and the business transactions are secured by blockchain and
    distributed ledger technologies. Figure 2. Typical structure of a smart contract
    system. Table 1. Characteristics of Blockchain-based Smart Contracts. In an IoT-based
    supply chain, smart contracts with blockchain technology can be utilized to enhance
    the security measures [37], to expedite data management, besides enabling the
    communication of diverse nodes or devices in an interoperable way. In smart contract-based
    security management [38], smart contracts can be used instead of digital certificates
    by including a list of several forms of identifiers or characteristics linked
    with the public key of the contract owner. Additionally, this list can only be
    modified only by its owner, and additional security is guaranteed by smart contact
    residing in the blockchain. Thus, by implementing smart contracts in blockchain
    eliminates the use of certification authorities. A blockchain-based smart contract
    simplifies the identity management of the users by providing a GUI (Graphical
    User Interface) [39] to each user having very little collision probability. It
    also facilitates the traditional and novel security schemes by storing additional
    primitives including TLS (Transport Layer Security) [40] public keys. By keeping
    public keys in the blockchain, clients do not need to count on pre-trusted certification
    authorities. Furthermore, due to the transparent and distributed characteristics
    of blockchain, this method is more robust against malicious authorities, in comparison
    to the DNS-based Authentication of naming entities (DANE) protocol [41], depending
    on the domain name system (DNS). Smart contracts and blockchain can expedite and
    develop data management in several ways including access control, information,
    functionality scoping (i.e., same contract can be deployed by multiple users and
    each contract gets its address and execute independently), proof of ownership,
    data authentication, and non-repudiation. Several platforms are emerging for smart
    contracts each having different associated characteristics that suit diverse applications.
    The associated workflows and cross-enterprise value procedures in a smart supply
    chain case can be thought of as an internet-connected intelligent production network
    or supply chain, in which products and services are developed and delivered downwards,
    data and finance move upstream, and smart contracts implement automated transaction
    protocols in both directions. As a result, blockchain technology, when combined
    with smart contract solutions, has the potential to promote entrepreneurial collaborative
    projects in logistics networks even throughout international borders, while also
    complementing existing foundation technology in the direction of smart supply
    chain solutions. Unlike conventional business processes, which are based on trusted
    centralized third-party service providers with their standards and architectures
    controlled by large players, blockchain technology allows these processes to be
    conducted in a distributed manner, lowering entry barriers, and encouraging process
    innovation. This supports entrepreneurial activity by deploying extra confidence
    inside firm networks and supply chains [42]. Furthermore, blockchains are often
    open and transparent, allowing all supply chain players to view, update, and check
    data, while modifying or deleting blockchain secured data is practically hard,
    resulting in increased transparency of all supply chain activities. As a result,
    supply chain providers may publicly advertise their availability to the whole
    market, as well as the capacity they have, enhancing their market position and
    increasing their independence from transportation brokers. This is an option for
    smaller suppliers and SME participants in a supply chain to combine their production
    outputs to fulfill large orders, allowing them to sell products directly to retailers
    or ultimate clients rather than through intermediaries. Wu et al. [43] created
    a smart contract for logistics, demonstrating how contract digitalization can
    complement or replace highly centralized fourth-party logistics providers, reducing
    the layers of intermediaries or businessmen within supply chains by directly connecting
    suppliers, processors, retailers, distributors, and logistics companies. All of
    these ideas are valid and adaptable to smart supply chains beyond restrictions.
    Due to the openness and transparency of blockchain-based supply chains, cross-enterprise
    business processes may be improved and optimized. To oversee and improve operations
    management and supply chain activities, Nyhuis and Wiendahl [44] introduced logistic
    operation curve theory and throughput-oriented lot sizing. However, empirical
    findings show that these theoretical notions do not operate effectively in practice,
    necessitating a revision of the underlying theoretical models [45]. Smart contracts
    may be used to start transactions amongst supply chain units to coordinate and
    optimize the whole supply chain. This applies to time-related issues such as throughput,
    cycle, and lead time, as well as cash flows along the supply chain. So, based
    on the findings, the most promising use of blockchain technology and smart contracts
    in the agri-culture supply chain network is reorganization of the agriculture
    product trading market by implementing cross-blockchain (cross-enterprise) asset
    and data transfer. 4. Application of Integrating Blockchain and IoT with Agri-Supply
    Chain To establish an efficient and reliable supply chain management system, the
    industry needs to employ cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, IoT, and AI.
    A data-driven smart agriculture supply chain with AI, IoT, and blockchain is the
    most promising approach to solve different existing problems. If we could generate
    a huge quantity of data from the supply chain and use that data to drive the decision
    processes. It can help to solve several problems related to food quality, safety,
    foodborne, data sharing across the supply chain, etc., globally. Some of the potential
    applications of blockchain, AI, and IoT in supply chain management are discussed.
    4.1. Food Composition, Quality, and Safety Monitoring Recently consumers are increasingly
    being made aware of the composition and quality of food products [46] through
    different awareness programs regarding healthy lifestyles and technological advancements
    in food science. Furthermore, due to new food regulations around the world companies
    need to label food products in detail alongside quality monitoring. Labeling guidelines
    [24] perform a pivotal part in finding out which scientific tests are suitable
    for a specific issue. Consumers around the globe are progressively requesting
    a guarantee that the origin and ingredients of their food follow the data on the
    label. This is the reason shoppers, producers, and administrative bodies have
    perceived the authenticity of food items as significant quality standards. Thus
    different IoT sensors based on UV-Visible-near infrared spectroscopy [47], DNA-PCR
    methods [48], stable isotope measurement (IRMS) [49], mass spectrometry [50],
    separation techniques [51], and big data are making a rapid advance in food products
    quality, composition, and assessment fields. Thus, the advancements in the development
    of distributed ledger technology along with IoT, big data, and micro-fabrication,
    and miniaturization of spectroscopic devices. Largely, UV-Visible-near infrared
    spectroscopy-based IoT, in association with blockchain and big data analysis provides
    an indispensable and vigorous variety and authenticity management mechanism for
    the smart agriculture area. 4.2. Food Safety across Supply Chain For all stakeholders
    around the world, food safety has developed as a global priority from farm to
    fork. There have been many foodborne outbreaks [52] based on fresh agriculture
    products in the recent past. That results in the dumping of a huge quantity of
    agri-produce to protect public health. It is estimated that the food requirement
    around the globe is anticipated to surge by fifty percent from 2020 to 2050, present
    practices of protecting the health of the masses by foodborne outbursts could
    be infeasible choices for the future. Every day an enormous amount of data is
    generated in the food industry and recognizing methods to abstract the vital material
    from diverse sources would assist in bacterial risk evaluation [53], outbreak
    deterrence, classification of trends utilizing pathogen supervision [54], which
    empowers food safety conclusions and supports decision making. Concurrent supervision
    of agri-food products throughout repository and distribution [55], RFID tag, GPS,
    and QR code like digital labeling that is not difficult to synchronize with the
    cloud, and improved traceability due to blockchain are a few out of numerous benefits
    that ICT can add to the prospectus food safety. The potential of blockchain and
    the internet of things to boost food reconnaissance frameworks are encouraging
    and performing synergistically by integrating AI-based big data evaluation like
    a prompt response towards food safety outbursts [56,57]. It is expected that the
    internet of things would be beneficial to carry out a comprehensive methodology
    in food handling in which key drivers like environmental change, human conduct,
    and economy might be joined to visualize food safety hazards and blockchain will
    enhance the privacy and security of data. 4.3. Food Product Traceability The traceability
    of food products has consistently been one of the main concerns of the customers.
    It is well-defined as the capability of a system to monitor and track the movement
    of agricultural food products across the supply chain from the producer to the
    final distribution stages [7,58]. Recently, with fast economic growth and the
    improved standard of living, people have started to pay more attention to the
    quality and nutritious values of the food. However, various food safety crises
    are always there. Customers from asymmetric information environments do not have
    access to the food supply chain information, which results in high health risks.
    Tracking has emerged as an essential service in the agri-food supply chain [13]
    to guarantee food safety to customers. The incompetence of the food monitoring
    organizations to isolate the source of adulteration in outbreaks break the community
    trust in the supply chain considerably. For instance, amid the Spinach flare-up
    [59] of 2006, it took fourteen days to identify the adulterant substance, and
    abundant resources were utilized. A different case incorporates the romaine lettuce
    episode [60] of 2018 during which all the lettuce was taken down the racks without
    awareness of the beginning of contamination. All available lettuce in markets
    was dumped due to a lack of proper back-tracing mechanism by the food governing
    organizations. The deficient record-keeping methods usage result in the inability
    of back-tracing of food products. This causes degradation of purchaser trusts
    and results in a critical setback for food producers. To solve this problem, blockchain
    innovation can be employed. Blockchain implementation will empower fast and exact
    back-tracing, decreasing expenses from food losses, and saving valuable living
    souls [61]. Blockchain distributed ledger technology [62] could be used in the
    food chain to store valuable information digitally such as food production data,
    ingredients, origin, shipment and storage data, expiry, etc. This will facilitate
    the prompt identification of foodborne outbreaks and the authenticity of the food.
    In recent years, various solutions utilizing several technologies such as IoT,
    RFID, AI, etc. have been proposed to advance agricultural food product traceability
    [7,8,10,12,13,17,29,62,63,64]. Figure 3 below shows an outline of how the product
    and data flow in an IoT-based blockchain supply chain system. The traceability
    system contains all the information about food production, processing, and transportation
    as well as storage conditions. The consumer should be provided access to all the
    information about each step precisely and even about every single ingredient of
    the final product. Figure 3. Blockchain-based smart agri-supply chain. 4.4. Tackle
    Food Waste There are different stages such as harvesting, post-harvest management,
    and repository, processing, distribution to markets and retailers, and consumption
    in the food supply chain through that food traverses from farm production to arrive
    at the consumer [65]. Food loss occurs at stages of post-harvesting (i.e., during
    post-harvest handling, storage, preparation, and distribution) and processed stage
    (i.e., at the retailer operations or behavior of consumers). Food waste also consists
    of losses during the pre-harvest session due to pests and diseases, or other issues
    like losses in fields due to extreme weather conditions, not harvested due to
    price drops, etc. [66]. Food loss and waste at any stage of the supply chain create
    numerous challenges and waste opportunities for growers, consumers, and communities
    as a whole. Loss in produce causes financial losses to farmers, shortages, and
    higher bills for customers. This financial burden is particularly grave for people
    on the food insecurity edge, where a trivial swing in price can substantially
    impact livelihood. Technology-based like blockchain, IoT, and big data solutions
    are being employed to manage food waste, perhaps the most pervasive issues confronting
    the food sector [67]. Addressing this persistent problem has turned into an industry
    critical that is being undertaken using different cutting-edge technologies to
    increase shelf-life, dynamic price adjustment depending on sell-by-dates, and
    monitor automatically food waste at restaurants, retail stores, pre-harvest and
    post-harvest losses, etc. In the food processing industries, blockchain-based
    supply chains are offering better transparency into food productions. IoT device
    network sends real-time data that can be utilized to optimize production processes
    and enhance quality, making it simple to satisfy the consumer needs, tackle the
    logistic issues, and withhold government regulations. Blockchain and IoT devices
    along with big data can provide food companies [67] with effective technological
    solutions to resolve challenging issues. 4.5. Inventory Management Inventory management
    is described as the process of overseeing the movement of goods from the production
    plant to warehouses and from these facilities to retail outlets [68]. It is an
    important part of supply chain management. It is worth noting that demand forecasting
    and inventory management are inextricably linked. If the provider fails to satisfy
    the needs of the customers, the company’s time and money are wasted, and the customers
    are dissatisfied. Alternatively, if supply exceeds demand, vital resources are
    depleted for no additional profit since there are no possibilities to sell the
    excess inventory. High inventory levels, according to several well-known business
    gurus, are one of the key concerns that restrict firms’ profitability [69]. Furthermore,
    as borrowing rates rise, inventory storage expenses rise as well. By precisely
    calculating supply volume in advance and devising dynamic operating plans, ML
    [70] approaches help to avoid such risks. Labor management, inventory system automation,
    vehicle deployment strategy optimization, and supply chain decision-making agility
    may all benefit from machine learning and data analytics methodologies. Proper
    forecasting of demand is critical for supply chain planning and management [71].
    While demand patterns for basic things like food are somewhat steady, demand uncertainty
    in leisure products like apparel and technology may be significant. Supply chain
    managers may use demand forecasting to plan productive business operations, optimize
    inventory levels, assess possible hazards, handle demand exceptions, and develop
    mitigation solutions. Inefficient demand forecasting tactics, on the other hand,
    can lead to inaccurate projections, which can result in considerable financial
    losses for businesses and wastage of food products. 5. Cyber Security Challenges
    in a BIoT-Based Supply Chain Network Supply chain networks are unnecessarily complex
    due to the involvement of multiple persons, business enterprises, governments,
    and maybe even nations. Supply chains confront several challenges, including (1)
    establishing trust amongst numerous parties involved; (2) cyberattacks; (3) cargo
    theft; and (4) counterfeiting, among others. However, in this section, we are
    going to discuss only the cyberattacks in IoT-based supply chains systems. Food
    and drinks are the most commonly stolen products, but medications and gadgets
    are expensive. The amount of security vulnerabilities that a supply chain confronts
    is directly related to the complexity of that supply network, i.e., as the supply
    chain becomes more complex, it becomes more vulnerable to various types of security
    threats. These hazards can disrupt supply chain operations in a variety of ways
    such as fraudulent replacement and tamper with items that can lower their utility
    and make them unpleasant for the end-user, the supply chain’s businesses, particularly
    third-party service providers, may not all have the same security requirements,
    and because information technology (IT) systems now control substantial portions
    of the supply chain, cybersecurity is one of the most pressing concerns. The chain
    is vulnerable to a single point of failure due to its heavy reliance on a networked
    IT system. Access to one of the systems can lead to access to other portions of
    the system that are not as secure. The future implication of IoT is apparent from
    its current applications in every field. It is growing continuously due to the
    evolution of hardware technologies including enhancing bandwidth utilization by
    addressing underutilization of frequency spectrum, improving energy efficiency,
    and extending computation and storage features. The cyber-physical systems and
    wireless sensor networks have developed as integral elements for the broader term
    IoT. As a result, the security issues associated with these technologies such
    as WSN, M2M continue to increase. Consequently, with the application of ICT and
    IoT in the agriculture industry, the potential risks of security attacks on the
    smart agriculture infrastructure [72] are increasing. Thus, the food sector is
    attracting more security attacks on its infrastructure and production facilities.
    Preventing such attacks needs a multi-disciplinary approach [73] that covers both
    hardware and software by policies and security mechanisms for preventing cyber-attacks
    or mitigating their impact on its occurrence. Thus, it is essential to identify
    potential security threats [64] and find solutions to prevent these threats. The
    security problems of an IoT network can be classified into three levels: (1) at
    the application layer, (2) at the network layer, and (3) at the perception layer.
    At the application layer, we require studying three security concerns, i.e., user
    data privacy, encrypted data analysis, and secure computing. Thus, when IoT devices
    are connected with the network, identity authenticity and data integrity are required.
    Without any authentication scheme, malicious devices can get access to the network.
    The IoT devices can access the IoT network application layer using cellular networks
    which adopt standard communication protocols. Those standard protocols are having
    advanced security. Two types of threats are faced in the perception layer: (a)
    many terminals have open insecure ports and numerous vulnerabilities that let
    unauthorized devices access. There are always security risks where hackers can
    exploit these weaknesses to launch different attacks and (b) terminals connected
    with short-range ISM band communication protocols such as ZigBee, WiFi, and Bluetooth
    having weak security mechanisms, thus are vulnerable to security attacks. Moreover,
    several of these terminals are having weak login and password mechanisms. These
    terminals also lack encryption algorithms between devices and the network. In
    this section, we are going to discuss major cyber security threats, security requirements,
    and some available solutions. The different types of security attacks to which
    the IoT-based agriculture supply chain is vulnerable are discussed in Table 2
    Blockchain technology finds its applications in nearly all areas of IoT, including
    the IoT-based smart agriculture supply chain [46,74,75]. The convergence of blockchain
    with IoT is to preserve privacy. Some of the relevant blockchain-based solutions
    that can be optimized for agri-supply chain applications available in the literature
    are presented in Table 3. Apart from the solutions presented in Table 3, there
    are several other methods present in the literature, which needs to be optimized
    for IoT-based smart agriculture application requirements. Table 2. Security Vulnerabilities
    in IoT-based Smart Agri-Food Supply Chain Platforms. Table 3. Blockchain-based
    solutions for the cyber security threats of IoT-based Agrifood Supply Chain In-frastructure.
    6. Implementation Challenges Even though blockchain-based internet of things use
    cases have been investigated, but the impact of ever-growing blockchain ledge
    size [87] has not been considered in these studies. Blockchain-based agri-food
    supply chains are a complex network [61] of inputs and outputs from farm to the
    fork and the generation of an enormous quantity of data from the implementation
    of a huge number of IoT devices at each stage [88]. The data produced from the
    IoT devices are sent to the blockchain as transactions [89]. As blockchain nodes
    are append-only data storages by definition. This implies that the node’s storage
    space requirements will constantly rise in direct correlation with the number
    of transactions executed per second [90]. Thus, the size of blockchain grows in
    proportion to the number of nodes that run concurrently, each node will want its
    own written copy of the blockchain ledger, and if you are operating at a large
    scale (hundreds and perhaps even multitudes of nodes), data storage space requirements
    might become a problem [91]. Due to two factors, the storage needs for blockchain
    networks will increase, (i) as the number of users expands, the number of transactions
    for each second increases, and (ii) every transaction expands the volume of the
    blockchain ledger, and since it is append-only, memory usage is continuously increasing.
    When we evaluate this with mutable systems, wherein data gets replaced, we could
    see how, as time passes, we begin to experience the ever-increasing ledger size
    in blockchain-based storage systems. There still are techniques to reduce the
    size of blockchain ledgers [92], but there is rising apprehension that the size
    of these ledgers may exceed the capacity of available storage considering the
    increasing number of IoT-based sensors in agriculture equipment, smart logistics,
    agri-stores, food processing companies, etc. Simply put, we want a system that
    allows us to expand our storage capacity without compromising performance or necessitating
    migrations that would result in downtime. Apart from the ever-increasing ledger
    size, as blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, every industry and
    institution is transitioning from centralized data storage to decentralized distributed
    ledger networks. With each passing day, the use of blockchain and decentralized
    ledger systems grows. As a result, each sector or organization chooses the blockchain
    technology that best meets their storage, security and privacy, latency, and other
    needs. Thus, we need a system where any supply chain entity with any distributed
    technology can join the supply chain while maintaining interoperability with the
    particular supply chain. The new architecture of the agri-supply chain also needs
    to solve interoperability [93], scalability, security, and privacy of personal
    data along with storage concerns with present single-chain networks. Interoperability
    may be improved by using common standards, this idea must be implemented since
    it will ensure that your networks are future-proof from the start. Furthermore,
    it would promote a strong ecosystem while avoiding any vendor lock-in issues.
    In the foreseeable future, it will all come down to interoperability [94]. As
    a result, adopting common standards to represent your blockchain strategy is a
    wonderful idea. This is something to consider for blockchain installation companies.
    Although most platforms are silos, the technology looks to be moving toward a
    paradigm that can support a network of networks. You must follow a set of common
    blockchain implementation standards to ensure that your solution does not fall
    behind. Furthermore, the initial step would be to create a solution registry.
    In addition, all blockchain implementation companies should make their data models
    and regulations public. When possible, use APIs with permissioned output, and
    base your blockchain strategy on industry standards. For example, the Decentralized
    Identity Foundation [95] publishes a set of rules for identifying digital assets,
    persons, and organizations across multiple platforms. A variety of collaborative
    initiatives, such as the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s Burrow and Hyperledger
    [96], support these principles. Figure 4 shows the classification of all other
    primary challenges such as granularity, conflicting interests, stakeholder management,
    etc. faced by the agriculture-supply chain traceability. Figure 4. Supply chain
    (SC) traceability challenges. 7. New Agri-SCM-BIoT Architecture New technologies
    that allow Industry 5.0, such as digital twins, collaborative robots, 5G and beyond,
    ML, IoT, edge computing, and others, when combined with human intelligence and
    innovation, can assist businesses in fulfilling demand and producing individualized
    and customized goods at a quicker rate. This enables SCM to integrate mass customization,
    a major idea in Industry 5.0, into their production processes [97]. Unmanned aerial
    vehicles are being employed in the supply chain to deliver the food packets, check
    and track the stocks, scan bar codes, and upload this data to warehouse systems
    [98,99]. Agri-food supply chains characterize a complicated system of inputs and
    outputs that connect agriculture farm products to consumers. Supply chains comprise
    several stakeholders such as financial institutes, agriculture practices, food
    processing industries, distributors, food retailers, and consumers. Apart from
    the main principle stakeholders, there are other parties like agrochemical industries,
    machinery and equipment manufacturers and dealers, waste processors, and feedstock
    supplies. As blockchain technology is submerging every sector and every organization
    is shifting from conventional centralized data storage to decentralized distributed
    ledger networks. Blockchain and decentralized ledge systems are exploding with
    each passing day. Thus, every industry or organization is selecting the blockchain
    technology that best suits its storage, security and privacy, latency, etc., requirements.
    Likewise, different agri-supply chain stakeholders should be able to select any
    distributed ledger technology while maintaining interoperability with a particular
    supply chain network. Therefore, interconnecting these stakeholders with different
    ledger technology with a particular supply chain is becoming a necessity. Storage,
    scalability, security, and privacy of personal data issues with the current single-chain
    networks also need to be addressed along with interoperability. To transfer assets
    in cross-blockchain systems and to solve the storage and scalability challenges
    of existing blockchain-based systems, we have introduced a new Agri-SCM-BIoT architecture
    (see Figure 4) for the agriculture supply chain. The Agri-SCM-BIoT system uses
    multiple blockchains to meet the requirements of the agriculture supply chain
    business. The local area blockchain, as represented in Figure 4, consists of a
    confederation of logically distinct blockchains implemented across multiple segments
    of the agri-supply chain network. In which the IoT gateways and edge computing
    nodes [100] function as blockchain member nodes. Consequently, each local area
    blockchain segment can have its blockchain ledger, policies of access control,
    and engagement terms. Different IoT agriculture business verticals can be represented
    in each edge-level blockchain organization. For instance, the multiple-tiered
    architecture of blockchain in the agri-supply chain can be used to reduce the
    security attack surface and prevent potential security risks [101] in the supply
    chain by keeping highly sensitive information like banking information away from
    the potential security risk nodes. The different blockchain verticals are used
    to store data of that particular segment like processing enterprise data is stored
    in processing enterprise blockchain vertical but other entities in the network
    are provided with access to trace back transaction data and other information
    at any time. This reduces the large memory requirement at participating nodes;
    the data turn out to be considerably more manageable and improves the latency
    of the system. In this scenario, the IoT devices are not required to take part
    in the consensus process [102], however, issue data transactions to local area
    blockchains. The IoT-based agri- robots, drones [103], and machines with mobility
    needs can utilize cellular data networks to send transactions to their particular
    blockchain segments. The local area blockchain deployments are private blockchains,
    where resource exhaustive consensus algorithms [100] such as PoW and PoS are not
    required. Any new node from outside gains accesses by getting permission from
    its current participating nodes. Consensus algorithms in permissioned blockchains
    produce complex network overhead with the increase in the node count. Consequently,
    puts a constraint on the number of member nodes, and requires to be adopted in
    localized networks. Furthermore, several design factors need to be considered
    towards guaranteeing the integrity of local area blockchain data contents. Since
    private-permissioned blockchains do not accomplish a similar degree of decentralization
    and irreversibility as open permissionless blockchains, it gets important to have
    the option to demonstrate the data of local area blockchains are unmodified. As
    proof of edge-level trustworthiness, it is imperative to either utilize the core-level
    blockchains to intermittently store a hash of some of the latest added blocks
    in each edge-level blockchain or utilize an independently separate public blockchain
    as a store for hashes of all local area blockchains. Some specific local blockchain
    nodes function as gateways between local area blockchain and core blockchains.
    These gateways are very significant for developing the inter-blockchain asset
    transfer in the agri-supply chain. The core blockchain segment is implemented
    between edge and cloud storage as shown in Figure 5 but it functions as a distributed
    fabric for controlling the core chain itself along with inter-chain communication
    among multiple local blockchains and controls access of new requesting nodes.
    Figure 5. Proposed new Agri-SCM-BIoT Architecture. Core-blockchain can be deployed
    as a public blockchain employing consensus algorithms like PoW and PoS for ensuring
    secure data transactions between blockchain verticals and users. Real-time communication
    among the local and core blockchain in place of an authenticating medium and access
    control, following which inter-blockchain communications [104] can take place.
    Inter-blockchain and cross-blockchain communication [105] are being investigated
    by academicians and industries at the protocol level. Transaction fees can be
    implemented within the local area blockchain to secure the local blockchain segments
    from flooding attacks effectively in case any IoT device or devices are compromised.
    The edge blockchain tier is responsible to process those tasks that need to be
    done closer to the IoT edge layer [55] for time-critical applications and transactions
    data gets stored on this layer. The core blockchain is used to store the recent
    transaction hash values only to prevent the increasing ledger size issue of the
    blockchain. It is also responsible for the transportation of data over IoT blockchain
    architecture from lower edge tiers to the cloud computing layer. Smart contracts
    with distributed and self-executing properties are used to automate and optimize
    all the processes (such as selling, purchase, asset transfer) [106] in the network.
    Smart contracts [107] will be used to assist in simplifying the whole process
    and enhance transparency throughout the supply chain. Supervisory control and
    data acquisition system (SCDAS) [108] is utilized by industry stakeholders to
    take different management decisions and control different processes in the supply
    chain. Therefore, the vision and concept of multi-tiered blockchain-edge architecture
    for multiple segment agri-supply chains is an achievable objective for providing
    distributed security. Data and statistical methods can be used in big supply chain
    analysis to enhance decisions across the whole supply chain. The widespread use
    of linked devices like vehicles, RFID readers, mobile platforms, cameras, and
    sensor networks creates a large amount of data. Companies may use big data analytics
    along with ML techniques to utilize this data to develop the attitude, skill set,
    and technology necessary to develop as a data factory [109]. Moreover, big data
    analytics [110] may contribute to the development of new approaches to enhance
    supply chain decision-making mechanisms, ranging from improved frontline operations
    to improved policy decisions, like the choice of a suitable supply chain operating
    model. The ML-based decision support system [111,112] can be employed at the edges
    itself as well as at the data servers to process the collected data. Manufacturers
    and distributors can properly estimate consumer demand using big data analysis
    and advanced predicting methodologies that take into account many elements such
    as weather, special events, and constantly evolving marketing trends. Amazon aims
    to use a predictive delivery system in the future [113], in which things are dispatched
    even before a buyer placed an order. Big data analytics employing deep learning
    and machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the behavior of sensor
    nodes to detect any adversaries and potential security threats in the network.
    If any node is behaving maliciously, we can remove that node without affecting
    the rest of the network by comparing the current node behavior with the normal
    behavior of the node. Thus, blockchains in food-supply chains can strengthen the
    growing transparency in supply chains due to the immutable transparent and decentralized
    nature of blockchain. It has the potential to impact each stage of the agriculture
    value chain. With IoT and smart contracts, blockchain could trace back the problem
    source, give real-time alerts on problem occurrence, assist in establishing confidence
    and trust between farmers, industries, and consumers. Besides, facilitate the
    fast execution of contracts, thus decreasing cost and delays, and could be employed
    for food certification. Due to its automated nature, the proposed methodology
    provides significant efficiency gains, which removes hidden expenses and paper
    burdens from the agriculture supply chain traceability process. Aside from the
    fundamental security and privacy of blockchain technology architecture, the presented
    models provide tremendous advantages regarding auditability and trust (auditable
    records) which can be viewed and utilized by important participants or external
    stakeholders such as regulators, legislators, and so on). It should also be mentioned
    that the suggested modeling technique has the considerable quality and reliability
    benefits. An immutable and decentralized traceability technology protects quality
    by detecting and preventing tampering with food data. As a result, the excellent
    quality of food items given to end-customers strengthens the agriculture food
    supply chain participants’ business operations. The proposed system will have
    the following characteristics as discussed. 7.1. System Storage and Performance
    Enhancement The continuous expanding nature of blockchain affects the throughput
    and redundancy by exhausting the system resources with managing the expanded data
    processing and communications [114]. The application of PoW for fast mining is
    a very expensive and power-intense consensus algorithm that reduces the performance
    of the whole blockchain network. By applying modular architecture can solve the
    ever-increasing size of blockchain in the state-of-the-art by storing data on
    multiple blockchains. The different blockchain modules such as farm blockchain
    will store data related to farms and processing enterprise blockchain will data
    related to different enterprises. This core blockchain module is designed to store
    only hash values of the previous transactions to solve the expanding ledger size
    issues and lower blockchains (private blockchain verticals) blockchain is used
    to store transaction data. The bulk data is stored in the blockchain-based cloud
    storage for further data abstraction and processing. 7.2. Privacy and Security
    Enhancement In traditional blockchain systems, the data is stored on a single
    ledger, and every node in the network can access that information. This enables
    the users to access the data that they do not require access to, thus giving rise
    to data confidentiality issues. Besides, there are other security vulnerabilities
    and threats such as 51% of attacks and double-spending attack problems. In the
    proposed architecture, we have tried to reduce the security attack surface and
    prevent potential security risks in the supply chain by making highly sensitive
    information inaccessible from potential high-risk nodes. There are some master
    nodes in each blockchain vertical that are authorized to coordinate and communicate
    with other blockchain verticals. These master nodes are made highly secure and
    have high computational resources than other nodes, which reduces the risk of
    51% attacks as well. Some of the data transactions require to get verified by
    multiple blockchain vertical verification. This gives an additional layer of security
    along with decreasing transaction congestion in one blockchain vertical as transactions
    get shifted to another vertical. The participating corporations or entities in
    the smart agriculture supply chain can keep the secrecy of their information and
    specify complex smart contract-based verification within the network. 7.3. Cross-Chain
    Communication between Heterogeneous Blockchain Platforms In the proposed architecture,
    we can think through a multi-organization setup where organizations can communicate
    with multiple organizations (i.e., one or more). These underlying blockchain networks
    connected these entities could be a private or public network (permissioned or
    permissionless) and each cooperate has its own IoT applications and business models
    [106]. The proposed model proposes the amalgamation of cooperate-owned private
    and public blockchains that facilitates verification of private data and exchange
    of public data as required. The private information of different organizations
    makes the block generation rate unpredictable. This property makes it hard for
    the adversary to execute malicious activities in comparison to a public blockchain
    where block generation is known. 7.4. IoT Device Authentication and Data Authentication
    and Integrity Due to heavy IPv6 stake for IoT devices, we will use 20-byte addressing
    generated by using the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in
    blockchain, which will act as a global unique identity (GUID) need no individual
    authentication for each IoT device due to a large number of addresses generated
    (about 1.46 × 1048) having exceptionally low collision likelihood. The IoT devices
    will authenticate and sign the data by the assigned GUI before transmission, thus
    authorizing the data authentication and integrity. The use of GUID can eradicate
    the need for a public-key management system, therefore significantly simplifying
    the other security protocols. Thus, lightweight security protocols can be used
    for communication in resource constraint devices. Big data analytics employing
    deep learning and machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the behavior
    of sensor nodes to detect any adversaries and potential security threats in the
    network. If any node is behaving maliciously, we can remove that node without
    affecting the rest of the network by comparing the current node behavior with
    the normal behavior of the node. 7.5. Managerial Implications of Various Stakeholders
    With the apparent technical transformations delivered by blockchain, big data,
    AI, and smart farming, we look to comprehend the stakeholder networks around the
    smart farm. These technologies have caused a significant advancement in the partner
    network function and how they interact with one another in the food supply chain
    [115]. In the proposed system architecture, the implementation of multiple blockchains
    for different levels is used to improve the efficiency of data management and
    privacy of the stakeholders in the smart agriculture system. Each stakeholder
    needs to manage and store the related data to that blockchain vertical. Thus,
    reduces the resource consumption by miners in storing the same information by
    different stakeholders, but the shared data of one stakeholder can be accessed
    by other stakeholders through a specific established authentication process (consensus
    process). 7.6. Transparency in the Agri-Supply Chain Blockchain in food supply
    chains can strengthen the growing transparency in supply chains due to the immutable
    transparent and decentralized nature of blockchain. It has the potential to impact
    each stage of the agriculture value chain [116,117]. With IoT and smart contracts,
    blockchain could trace back the problem source, give real-time alerts on problem
    occurrence, assist in establishing confidence and trust between farmers, industries,
    and consumers, facilitate the fast execution of contracts, thus decreasing cost
    and delays, and could be employed for food certification. 8. Future Work An absence
    of information security and confidentiality negatively influences the accuracy
    of the process, as stakeholders such as farmers are fearful of information leakage
    during transfer to other external systems. Moreover, participants in the agri-supply
    chain do not want to share their information with the business rivals in a transparent
    system. Even though different schemes for data security and privacy, like ring
    signatures, have been utilized for blockchain-based farming, there are no techniques
    to conceal the transaction data of senders and recipients and the amount of the
    transaction. Hence, information control and assurance are significant in IoT and
    blockchain-based agribusiness. Future studies should concentrate on how to concurrently
    hide the multi-party transaction information in hypothetical examination and implementation
    practices. Also, the roles and elements of governments in endorsing these new
    technological developments should be assessed. Besides, it is also critical to
    assess the behavior of users and hence add to information assurance, and how to
    lessen reservation of information sharing in blockchain-based agribusiness. Scalability
    issues come in the study of both IoT and blockchain-based agri-sector. Critical
    problems of latency and scalability are not studied sufficiently in the blockchain-based
    agriculture supply chain. The convergence of different technologies like IoT and
    AI in the blockchain is already been investigated in academia and industry for
    sustainability. Then the outcome of the investigations can be applied to the innovation
    for agriculture industry sustainable development. The apprehension of financial
    investment retrieval in the implementation of these advanced technologies among
    farmers is a concern. Future opportunities should utilize the “theory of inventive
    problem solving” to develop technologies to decrease expenses. Political scholars
    require researching how to encourage policymakers efficiently to devise proper
    policies to encourage technology innovation. High energy usage and carbon dioxide
    emissions are the foremost glitches, which oppose the objective of a sustainable
    environment. Further research needs to perform comparative studies on the development
    of agri-sector, based on different IoT and blockchain applications, to distinguish
    and promote eco-friendly and green technologies. The nonexistence of uniform standards
    is the main hindrances to policies and guidelines with which participants can
    follow. These standards build up market stability by regulating the participants’
    behavior, boosting public trust, and the adoption of technological inventions.
    Future investigation can study policies and standards in the agriculture sector;
    though, implementation of identical standards is deeply dependent on various stakeholders
    in the supply chain who control the equipment, systems, hardware, and software
    development. For imposing standards at various points of the supply chain future
    studies must examine the government roles and functions. Researchers should explore
    how management integrates resources, synchronize, addresses conflicts, and promote
    more schemes to enhance the impacts of these technologies in the agri-sector.
    9. Conclusions It is well understood from the literature review that the application
    of blockchain, AI, and IoT in agriculture is still in the developing stage. The
    existing work mainly comprises evocative and prescriptive studies with very few
    definite systems being designed and implemented, even at the prototype level.
    There is a requirement of implementing a large number of real-time use cases to
    analyze the suggested results that many existing works claim including improved
    performance, intelligent decision support, security, and privacy of different
    acting entities throughout the supply chain, enhanced food safety, and environment-friendly
    techniques. Besides, there is a need to develop optimization tools to implement
    the existing solutions of these technologies in agriculture applications and can
    assist in addressing various implementation challenges. Motivated by the characteristics
    and solutions offered by technologies such as blockchain technology, IoT, and
    AI to deliver reliable, transparent, secure services and smart decision support
    systems for all supply chain management operations, this study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT
    architecture (cf. Figure 5) to address storage and scalability optimization, interoperability,
    security and privacy issues, and storage concerns with existing single-chain agriculture
    supply chain systems. The new Agri-SCM-IoT infrastructure should be built to use
    as minimum computing power, memory, energy, and bandwidth as possible. Because
    of the sensors’ limited capabilities, including security elements to ensure Confidentiality,
    Integrity, and Availability is difficult. However, because it includes several
    stakeholders and diverse parties, it is necessary to develop a trustworthy blockchain-based
    cross-chain SCM system. The future smart and secure SCM system should be resource-efficient,
    appropriate, simple to implement, provide interoperability, and most importantly,
    trustworthy without the need for human participation. Even though the literature
    studied on the blockchain, AI, and IoT in the agriculture supply chain highlight
    remarkable growth in the sector, there are significant limitations and research
    gaps hindering the implementation of these technologies and extensively the sustainable
    development of the agriculture sector. We expect that this study will provide
    enhanced understanding and guidance for the further research and implementation
    of smart agri-supply chain management using these technologies. Author Contributions

  description: Foodborne pathogens are a major contributor to foodborne illness worldwide.
    The adaptation of a more quantitative risk-based approach, with metrics such as
    Food safety Objectives (FSO) and Performance Objectives (PO) necessitates quantitative
    inputs from all stages of the food value chain. The potential exists for utilization
    of big data, generated through digital transformational technologies, as inputs
    to a dynamic risk management concept for food safety microbiology. The industrial
    revolution in Internet of Things (IoT) will leverage data inputs from precision
    agriculture, connected factories/logistics, precision healthcare, and precision
    food safety, to improve the dynamism of microbial risk management. Furthermore,
    interconnectivity of public health databases, social media, and e-commerce tools
    as well as technologies such as blockchain will enhance traceability for retrospective
    and real-time management of foodborne cases. Despite the enormous potential of
    data volume and velocity, some challenges remain, including data ownership, interoperability,
    and accessibility. This paper gives insight to the prospective use of big data
    for dynamic risk management from a microbiological safety perspective in the context
    of the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF)
    conceptual equation, and describes examples of how a dynamic risk management system
    (DRMS) could be used in real-time to identify hazards and control Shiga toxin-producing
    Escherichia coli risks related to leafy greens.

    are a major contributor to foodborne illness worldwide. The adaptation of a more
    quantitative risk-based approach, with metrics such as Food safety Objectives
    (FSO) and Performance Objectives (PO) necessitates quantitative inputs from all
    stages of the food value chain. The potential exists for utilization of big data,
    generated through digital transformational technologies, as inputs to a dynamic
    risk management concept for food safety microbiology. The industrial revolution
    in Internet of Things (IoT) will leverage data inputs from precision agriculture,
    connected factories/logistics, precision healthcare, and precision food safety,
    to improve the dynamism of microbial risk management. Furthermore, interconnectivity
    of public health databases, social media, and e-commerce tools as well as technologies
    such as blockchain will enhance traceability for retrospective and real-time management
    of foodborne cases. Despite the enormous potential of data volume and velocity,
    some challenges remain, including data ownership, interoperability, and accessibility.
    This paper gives insight to the prospective use of big data for dynamic risk management
    from a microbiological safety perspective in the context of the International
    Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) conceptual equation,
    and describes examples of how a dynamic risk management system (DRMS) could be
    used in real-time to identify hazards and control Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia
    coli risks related to leafy greens. Introduction An estimated 600 million people
    fall ill through the consumption of contaminated food and 420,000 die every year,
    resulting in the loss of 33 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (World Health
    Organization, 2015). These estimates can be used to direct food safety policy
    and risk management options (Scallan et al., 2011). The need for a risk-based
    approach for production of safe food is underpinned by the adoption of HACCP with
    the necessary prerequisite programs. In turn, risk management metrics, with tools
    and concepts such as Food Safety Objectives (FSO) and Performance Objectives (PO),
    proposed by the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for
    Foods (ICMSF) and adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (International
    Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods, 2010; Codex Alimentarius
    Commission, 2016) represent a more quantitative risk management approach that
    can be used by intergovernmental agencies, national governments, and food businesses.
    Food safety related data, acquired throughout the food chain is required for real-time
    food safety decision-making by all stakeholders, including risk assessors, managers,
    and communicators. Global megatrends, described as transformative global forces
    will pose significant challenges to future global food safety, food security,
    and nutrition (High Level Panel of Experts, 2017; King et al., 2017). Key drivers
    for change include: Global economic growth/investment/trade pricing, innovation
    in food production and productivity, structural and socio-economic impacts on
    food supply chains and changing food safety and quality management systems. The
    rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital transformation (Wellness
    Recovery Action Plan, 2015; Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health
    Organization, 2018) has enabled the collection and transfer of “big data,” in
    real-time. This can impact most parts of the food chain. Key characteristics of
    big data are often referred to as: volume of data produced; velocity – speed of
    data streaming; veracity – uncertainty of data; variety – structured and unstructured
    data; and ultimately value – the worth of data for actionable insights and information
    for food safety, public health, and trade (Marvin et al., 2017). The ability to
    collect, analyze, and convey digital data at all stages of the food value chain
    has seen an exponential increase in the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity
    of data available. Data sources impacting food safety include food production,
    food consumption, public health, agriculture, environmental conditions logistics,
    social media, etc., containing structured and unstructured formats. The ability
    to extract value from these data, while ensuring the interoperability of different
    sources to assure food safety and quality, is the future challenge. While data
    scientists can easily build tools and dashboards to visualize data, often the
    outcomes have highlighted the need to have “clean” and reliable (meta)data, in
    formats that can be accurately interpreted by subject matter experts (Ridzuan
    and Zainm, 2019). The emergence of precision agriculture, often referred to “smart
    farming,” using digitalization in farming practices (Bhakta et al., 2019; Shafi
    et al., 2019) and “omics-based” precision food safety (Kovac et al., 2017; Kovac,
    2019) leverages linked data for foodborne outbreak traceability, predictive analytics,
    artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning in the realm of food safety
    management. Digital transformation in food manufacturing and supply chain enables
    better utilization of data for more dynamic risk management, automated adjustment
    for deviations, real-time transparency of food safety and quality control parameters,
    product release, defect rate reduction, and trend analysis. This paper examines
    the increasing opportunities to collect, integrate, analysis, and interpret data
    throughout the food value chain, to predict, assess, and manage microbial food
    safety risks, in the context of a dynamic risk management system (DRMS). Simulation
    scenarios are described whereby Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)
    contamination of leafy greens occurs during production and processing, but it
    can be controlled in real-time by using big data to investigate and manage the
    risk. The challenges of valuable data availability, accessibility, ownership,
    and interoperability will also be discussed. Precision Agriculture and Digital
    Food Supply Chain: Inputs for Food Safety Management Food production, and concomitantly
    the safety and quality of food, originates on farms. Increased data availability
    via the internet now allows for devices on farms to connect to IoT networks to
    collect and interpret data from the beginning of the supply chain through to retail/consumers.
    Precision agriculture enables agricultural production systems to deploy robotics,
    sensors, global navigation satellite systems (GPS), and big data analytics to
    gather unique data on a more precise, spatial, and temporal scale (Aqeel-Ur-Rehman
    et al., 2014; Wolfert et al., 2017; Weersink et al., 2018; Astilla et al., 2019).
    Consequently, the information gathered can be used for the application of more
    prescriptive inputs to support production crop/livestock yields, environmental
    impacts, economic returns, and food security/safety to improve food safety management
    decisions. Kamilaris et al. (2017) provide an example of data that can be garnered
    from precision agriculture to help guide food safety, albeit not specifically
    microbiological safety. Using the tools of smart farming and data analytic platforms,
    the needs of individual livestock or crop areas can be targeted and customized
    with inputs such as rotation feeding, pesticide application/withdrawal or irrigation
    (Ramundo et al., 2016; Grieve et al., 2019). Furthermore, these technologies can
    provide an opportunity for farmers to increase food security with decreased environmental
    impact (Garnett et al., 2013). A major benefit of the emerging agricultural precision
    technologies is the opportunity to ensure greater transparency, traceability,
    provenance as well as food safety and quality attributes (Danezis et al., 2016).
    Investigations of foodborne outbreaks linked to plant or animal-based products
    (Currie et al., 2019; Self et al., 2019), food fraud (Van Rijswijk and Frewer,
    2012), and consumer demand for food provenance (Badia-Melis et al., 2015; Danezis
    et al., 2016), confirm the need for assimilation and integration of “agricultural”
    data. The future prospect is that big data can be used to predict the presence
    of pathogens or contaminants, by linking environmental information with pathogen
    growth and/or hazard occurrence. For example, by monitoring the conditions of
    crops in the field including weather data, the areas with an increased potential
    of aflatoxins can be identified before the crop enters the food chain (Armbruster
    and MacDonell, 2014). Environmental informatics can help identify high-risk periods,
    which may trigger effective control for the downstream food supply chain. Data
    gathered from digital information systems on farm, including field scanning drones,
    can precisely identify areas within a field, which are subject to aflatoxin contamination
    because of particular crop conditions. In turn, this real-time data, facilitated
    by smart technologies including AI, directs mitigation measures, in the form of
    dynamic harvesting, to prevent food quality issues downstream (Grieve et al.,
    2019). Drones, which are now regularly used in large-scale agriculture, will be
    increasingly used to harness data related to food safety and quality, e.g., animal
    intrusion in crop fields or localized field flooding conditions (Cancela et al.,
    2019). Potential also exists for large farm owners to use wireless IoT applications
    to collect data regarding the location, well-being, and health of their cattle
    (Busse et al., 2015; Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2019). Biosensors and wearable technologies
    may be used to identify unhealthy animals (Neethirajan, 2017; Vidic et al., 2017).
    Availability of such real-time data enables livestock managers to separate unhealthy
    animals from the herd. In some circumstances, such herd/flock management could
    mitigate potential food safety issues in the human population e.g., if the carrier/shedder
    status of both healthy and unhealthy animals, was available for foodborne pathogens.
    Strawn et al. (2013) have described the predictive potential of combining environmental
    and meteorological data for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. It is foreseeable
    that further data collecting devices and databases will be interconnected to provide
    voluminous structured and unstructured data at the farm level. This will be used
    to enhance source attribution analysis in foodborne outbreak scenarios and enable
    more precise farming for food safety and quality attributes. The data sources
    that may be used include: crop worker health status, water quality and usage,
    meteorological information, real-time livestock health status, animal health records,
    veterinary medicine prescription records, animal movement records, animal feed
    quality and usage, and farm audit certification records. However, it must be acknowledged
    that some data, e.g., related to personnel (health/medical status) will be inaccessible
    and therefore data indicative of GAP/hygienic practices may be more readily available.
    There are still many processes that are done manually in the food industry, but
    this can change with the increasing use of IoT driven food processing equipment
    (Bayano-Tejero et al., 2019), and the use of IoT in water dispensing, cleaning
    and disinfectant dosing, pest monitoring, etc. Automation can reduce repetitive
    processes, making them more efficient and the digital contents and data generated,
    can provide better insights about the day-to-day operations (Hasnan and Yusoff,
    2018). Blockchain technology (BCT) is a distributed, decentralized, public ledger
    (or database) for permanent and verifiable record-keeping that can transform food
    systems by increasing efficiency, transparency, and collaboration throughout the
    chain (Antonucci et al., 2019). BCT provides the opportunity to access and use
    data, shared by connected partners (public and private) in the food supply chain
    (Sander et al., 2018; Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018). It is foreseeable that upstream
    food safety parameters, collated and logged in BC ledgers could be analyzed and
    used as part of a risk-based inspection system downstream in the supply chain.
    Precision Public Health/Consumer Feedback: Inputs for Food Safety Management Precision
    public health uses surveillance data and sophisticated analytics to accurately
    measure the global prevalence and consequences of foodborne diseases (Dowell et
    al., 2016), pathogens in food, and environmental exposure, as well as consumer
    behavior, in a way that allows better assessment of population health risk factors,
    and the development of policies and targeted programs (Khoury et al., 2016) to
    prevent foodborne diseases. Data gathering has helped in public health interventions
    including use of: • Publically available data sets and data obtained from social
    media to predict the occurrence of critical food safety violations in food businesses
    (Goldsmith, 2015). • Mobile Call Detail Records (CDR) to track human population
    movement, while managing outbreaks (Wesolowski et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2018).
    • Use of supermarket courtesy cards and e-commerce sales records in outbreak investigations
    and increasing the effectiveness of product recalls (Møller et al., 2018). A wide
    range of structured datasets are currently available or could be accessed for
    developing improved public health interventions. These include: • The WHO food
    safety platform FOSCOLLAB and other National/Regional food safety databases such
    as TESSY, RASSF (Marvin et al., 2017). • Electronic healthcare and medical records
    (Goldstein et al., 2016), medical claims data and OECD pharmaceutical demand data,
    where accessible without breaches of personnel privacy. • Certification data (product,
    management system, personal certification, etc.) available with third-party certification
    bodies There are also large sets of high volume, unstructured data that could
    be used to trace food incidents or exposure to a particular food by analyzing:
    • Food consumption patterns and trends that could be obtained from digital food
    related platforms used for food ordering or diet management • Social media interactions
    (e.g., increased requests for information on how to treat diarrhea) that could
    indicate the prevalence or spread of an illness (Broniatowski et al., 2014). Precision
    Food Safety: Inputs for Food Safety Management The rapid growth of “big data”
    in the food industry has revolutionized the field of microbial food safety and
    has led to the term, “precision food safety,” to describe all the various new
    data sources that can be used to improve food safety risk management (Kovac et
    al., 2017; Kovac, 2019). For example, genomics-based approaches based on whole
    genome sequencing (WGS) are greatly advancing our ability to retrospectively detect
    food safety outbreaks, and WGS is now being routinely used to characterize human,
    food, and environmental isolates of all key foodborne pathogens, bringing a high
    level of precision to interpretation of foodborne disease outbreaks (Ronholm et
    al., 2016; Brown et al., 2019). An example of this accumulation of big data is
    the creation of the United States FDA’s GenomeTrakr WGS Network, which is the
    first integrated network of state and federal labs to use WGS to track foodborne
    pathogens to improve outbreak response activities (Allard et al., 2016). The network
    consists of a publicly available global database containing the genetic makeup
    of thousands of foodborne disease-causing bacteria from food and environmental
    sources housed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at
    the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Tolar et al., 2019). Participants in GenomeTrakr
    include not only United States federal and state laboratories, but also international
    and reference laboratories. A big advantage of using WGS in an integrated manner
    is that outbreaks can be identified at an earlier stage and therefore resolved
    faster (Besser et al., 2019). In fact, WGS can provide information beyond the
    identity and relationship of strains and can help to improve the safety, quality,
    and shelf life of foods. This can be extremely valuable for regulators and the
    food industry to help design, prioritize, and implement effective risk management
    interventions (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2016). For food manufacturers,
    an advantage of using WGS would be differentiation of transient and resident pathogens,
    as part of a food company’s environmental monitoring program. Furthermore, WGS
    can be used for source attribution related to country of origin (Franz et al.,
    2016; Koutsoumanis et al., 2019). In addition to source tracking/attribution,
    WGS can also (i) enable an assessment of the AMR status of strains; (ii) provide
    insights into bacterial adaptation and survival; and (iii) as well as provide
    information on pathogenicity. The latter information can be used, for example,
    to better inform risk assessments, e.g., assessment of the presence of less pathogenic
    L. monocytogenes strains containing a truncated internalin A protein (Chen et
    al., 2011; Nielsen et al., 2017). Omic approaches such as metagenomics are also
    very valuable to help us to understand the microbial communities (i.e., the microbiomes)
    and the genes of interest directly from a food sample, without the need for isolation
    of the specific bacteria that provide those genes (Doyle et al., 2017; Forbes
    et al., 2017). An ideal approach would be to develop metagenomics methods that
    are independent of culture and combine both the detection and subtyping of the
    infecting organisms (including the “natural” microbiome) directly from a food
    or clinical specimen (Ottesen et al., 2020). In the area of food spoilage, one
    can use omics technology to develop microbiome-based pathogen control strategies
    that can be implemented in the food industry. One example is the development of
    advanced sanitation approaches based on an understanding of the different microbial
    ecologies found in individual food processing environments (Gu et al., 2019).
    The next step toward advancing food safety risk management is using a systems-based
    and machine learning approach to omics that would integrate all of the genomic,
    metagenomic, phenotypic, and epidemiological data, with risk assessments informed
    by these data (Deneke et al., 2017). Outbreaks: Potential Uses of Big Data for
    Dynamic Risk Management In 2018, two outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 were linked
    to the consumption of romaine lettuce in Canada and the United States (Centers
    for Disease Control, 2018, 2019; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2018, 2019).
    In the first outbreak, clusters of E. coli O157:H7 were linked by WGS sequences,
    and leafy greens from Yuma growing region identified as the likely source (Food
    and Drug Administration, 2018a). The traceback investigations (Gerrity, 2018)
    identified a total of 36 growing fields on 23 farms in Arizona and California
    as potential sources of contaminated lettuce, feeding into seven intermediate
    shippers. Only one of these shippers did not comingle romaine lettuce from multiple
    farms and shipped the romaine as whole-head product. Follow-up environmental assessment
    weeks after the outbreak identified three water samples from an irrigation canal
    that delivered water to farms in the local area, including several identified,
    containing E. coli O157:H7 with the same WGS genetic fingerprint as the outbreak
    cases (Food and Drug Administration, 2018b). A concentrated animal feeding operation
    (CAFO) was located adjacent to the irrigation canal, but no obvious route for
    E. coli O157:H7 contamination was determined, and none of the samples collected
    contained the outbreak strain. Growers suggested that leaf freeze damage and dew
    on romaine leaves created conditions favorable for windborne contamination, with
    dust carrying the outbreak strain. Dust has previously been identified as a potential
    route for STEC contamination (Berry et al., 2015). The commingling of romaine
    lettuce from various farm growing fields at fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing
    facilities complicated FDA traceback efforts. In the following, 2018–2019 season,
    FDA sampled 118 romaine lettuces for E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella at 26 commercial
    coolers and cold storage facilities (Food and Drug Administration, 2019a). Salmonella
    was not found, and one sample was positive for a non-pathogenic E. coli O157:H7.
    In the second outbreak (Centers for Disease Control, 2019; Public Health Agency
    of Canada, 2019), clusters of E. coli O157:H7 were first linked by WGS (Food and
    Drug Administration, 2019b). WGS also revealed that the E. coli O157:H7 strain
    was closely related to an E. coli strain from ill people in a 2017 outbreak linked
    to leafy greens, but not related to the first, 2018 outbreak discussed above.
    Traceback investigations initiated from six points of service identified 14 distributors,
    17 farms, and 15 specific fields in multiple California counties. This was eventually
    narrowed to one farm, which was also identified as one of the potential suppliers
    of leafy greens or romaine lettuce in the 2017 outbreak investigations. A sediment
    sample from an on-farm water reservoir tested positive for the outbreak strain.
    While the precise route of contamination is uncertain, plausible ways in which
    this water may have contaminated the romaine lettuce included direct harvest/postharvest
    application to the crop and/or to harvest equipment food contact surfaces. While
    the farm did have a procedure in place to collect and test the reservoir water
    for generic E. coli and treat the water tank with a sanitizer before use, verification
    procedure records did not document that the water sanitizer was present at levels
    that would assure that the water was not contaminated with pathogenic bacteria.
    Inspection of water tank sanitizer treatment systems used revealed that some units
    had undissolved sanitizer cakes and that some tank systems were constructed in
    a manner that likely did not allow for optimal sanitizer treatment of the agricultural
    water before use. Potential sources of big data that can be generated and collected
    during leafy green production, such as harvesting, cutting, packing, distribution,
    retail sale and from consumers are identified in Figure 1. Many of these sources
    and types of data have been discussed above. Data generated through WGS was able
    to identify both outbreaks detailed above, and even linked the second outbreak
    to an outbreak from 2017. It is easy to see how traceability technology (e.g.,
    BCT) information can be linked between production fields, farms, harvesters, distributers,
    and points of services, and that lengthy and complicated traceback efforts could
    have been greatly accelerated. figure 1 Figure 1. A number of examples of the
    types of big data currently or potentially available across the leafy green food
    chain that can be integrated for use in traceback to determine implicated product
    source during outbreak situations, and can be used to inform dynamic risk management
    systems (DRMS). Microbiological Quantitative Risk Management in a Digital/Big
    Data Era The conceptual ICMSF equation proposes that the change in food safety
    (microbiological) risk from a food can be understood in terms of the potential
    for growth and/or recontamination (“ΣI”), or inactivation (“ΣR”) of relevant pathogens
    in the food as they move through the supply chain and final processing of the
    food prior to serving and consumption. It is usually expressed as: H o − Σ R +
    Σ I ≤ FSO and is based on the final level of contamination at the point of consumption.
    The equation proposes that the sum of the processes during the farm-to-fork continuum
    that allow pathogen growth, minus those processes in the same pathway that involve
    pathogen inactivation, determine the risk of illness to consumers, because they
    estimate the average levels and prevalence of pathogens in the product at the
    time of consumption. Accordingly, if we can estimate the overall potential for
    pathogen growth, compared to pathogen inactivation in a food/food process, we
    can begin to estimate the risk of illness to a consumer. The ICMSF equation encapsulates
    these considerations by evaluating the initial level of contamination («Ho»),
    the potential for increase (growth and recontamination) or cross contamination
    («ΣI»), and the potential for inactivation («ΣR»), all measured in log CFU. The
    potential for dynamic risk management to identify hazards and control STEC risks
    related to leafy greens using big data inputs to elements of the ICMSF conceptual
    equation is represented in Figure 2. figure 2 Figure 2. Stylized DRMS. Dynamic
    risk management involves the use of big data for quick identification of changing
    conditions resulting in potential changes to the hazard analysis and facilitates
    decision-making to manage those risks in real-time. (A) through (D) represent
    examples of how a DRMS could have been used to identify hazards and control Shiga
    toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) risks related to leafy greens. (A) represents
    the baseline conceptual risk management in a fresh-cut leafy greens operation,
    where the initial hazard level, controlled by preventive measures during production
    is below the Food Safety Objectives (FSO), and (i) no introduction or cross-contamination
    occurs during harvest; (ii) there is a small reduction during washing, and (iii)
    potential increases in STEC populations are controlled by the cold chain. (B)
    represents STEC contamination of leafy greens during processing. The initial hazard
    level is controlled by preventive measures during production, and (i) no introduction
    or cross-contamination occurs during harvest, (ii) untreated water used during
    the wash step introduces a high level of STEC, and (iii) potential increases in
    STEC populations are controlled by the cold chain. In this case, DRMS would have
    had the real-time data surrounding the wash water (see Figure 1), flagged a concern,
    and allowed for risk management decision-making that could have prevented entry
    of this product into the supply chain. (C) represents STEC contamination of leafy
    greens during production. Due to a breakdown in pre-harvest preventive measures,
    the initial hazard level is higher than the baseline, which may be due to a combination
    of factors including (i) proximity of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs),
    (ii) unusual weather patterns (i.e., winds and freezing), and/or (iii) contaminated
    water sources used in applications that contacted harvested product. For this
    scenario, (i) no introduction or cross-contamination occurs during harvest; (ii)
    there is a small reduction during washing, and (iii) potential increases in STEC
    populations are controlled by the cold chain. In this example, DRMS would have
    the real-time data around production practices (see Figure 1), flagged a concern,
    and allowed for risk management decision-making to prevent entry of this product
    into the supply chain. (D) represents a potential response to (C) using DRMS.
    When DRMS flagged a concern with production water use (see Figure 1), the risk
    management decision is made to treat the water (e.g., chemical treatment, UV light)
    that contacts the harvestable portion of the leafy greens (i.e., overhead irrigation,
    foliar sprays, and aerial sprays) prior to application to reduce the introduction
    of STEC from this source. The risk management decision to treat the irrigation
    water decreases STEC levels to below the FSO. The potential for sensors and communications
    technologies, integrated with predictive microbiology models to assess the microbiological
    quality and safety of foods in domestic and international supply chains has already
    been demonstrated (Goldstein et al., 2016; Vidic et al., 2017). This is an example
    of big data being used to improve the microbiological quality and safety of foods.
    Challenges Beyond Opportunities An integrated system incorporating digitally-derived
    “big data” as inputs for a dynamic food safety risk management, remains a distinct
    possibility. The opportunity to use unused data sources, beyond classical food
    safety management data (e.g., critical limits in HACCP, process data, chill chain
    parameters, etc.) can impact not only transparency and traceability, but also
    can be used to predict and anticipate higher risk scenarios as well as plan and
    implement mitigation measures for microbiological food safety issues. However,
    the digitally disruptive era is not without its challenges in the food safety
    realm. Foremost is the availability and accessibility to internet connectivity
    across increasingly global food value chains. Furthermore, there is the technical
    infrastructure and perceived benefit discrepancy between developing and developed
    countries, large food manufacturers and Small Medium Enterprises (SME) to consider.
    While the volume and velocity of data from precision agriculture, precision public
    health, and precision food safety increases exponentially, the variety and veracity,
    viz a viz, mismatch between provider and end user, increasing extent of unstructured,
    unverified and biased user population data sources e.g., social media, blogging,
    will require a form of validation, cleansing or normalization of the data to avoid
    distortion or misrepresentation. Furthermore, transparency, confidentiality, accuracy,
    and fairness are important aspects of responsible data science (Responsible Data
    Science, 2016). Data scientists will play an increasingly important role in collation,
    combination and visualization of different data sources, while subject matter
    experts such as microbiologists, will still have a vital role to assess, challenge,
    and interpret this collated data for proper risk management and communication.
    While technical issues remain on the interoperability and interconnectivity of
    the IT sources (Manyika et al., 2015), greater hurdles exist around the ownership,
    governance, sharing, accessibility, and security of the derived data. For example,
    concern has been raised on the contractual issues relating to precision agriculture,
    where larger companies invest in digital collection systems, which may exclude
    many stakeholders with valuable input to food safety management (Carbonell, 2016).
    A key tool in precision food safety is WGS, however, inaccessibility to private
    and some public sequenced pathogen databases, while understandable from some stakeholder
    perspectives (Jagadeesan et al., 2019), may limit dynamic risk management assessment/options.
    Similarly, uptake of BCT requires minimum data standards with practical and user-friendly
    interphases between all parties, if it is to be widely adopted in both the private
    and public sector. The perceived bureaucracy and value to smaller stakeholders
    in the foodchain are deterrants to contribute to BCT and therefore garbage in
    garbage out (GIGO) can be the consequence. Near real-time interventions, for the
    management of food safety risks, based on the diversity of data throughout the
    value chain, will require validation using numerous iterations of relevant data,
    related to case studies for foodborne outbreak/cases. Validation is particularly
    important, as these types of data are increasingly being used as the basis for
    regulatory actions, civil suits and even criminal cases. A court challenge that
    indicates that the science could not be totally relied upon would set a legal
    precedent that greatly reduces its potential role as a driver. An avalanche of
    data – so-called infodemic, as illustrated by the Covid 19 pandemic, from verified
    scientific sources and unverified data, can disrupt the role of the risk manager.
    Therefore, risk assessors, dealing with such data, must use it cautiously to inform
    risk assessment, while ultimately, the decision making regarding food safety,
    rests with risk managers. Furthermore, the cost and technical expertise needed
    to achieve precision food safety systems is likely to increase. It is unlikely
    that developing countries are going to be able to achieve the degree of infrastructure
    needed, at least in the short term. This will further aggravate the inability
    of developing countries to gain entry to the markets of developed countries, an
    issue already of concern internationally. This is particularly important when
    one considers that export of agricultural commodities and specialty crops is one
    of the primary ways that developing countries gain access to “hard currencies,”
    which is critical to developing country economic health. Data Availability Statement

    efficiency 1. Introduction Studies on information and communications technology
    (ICT)-based e-agriculture have shown great improvements in practice, such as access
    to effective information (Das and Solanki, 2005), support for decision making
    (Rao, 2007), and increased productivity (Eitzinger et al., 2019). Additionally,
    innovation and progress in blockchain technologies (BTs) have changed the information
    technology sector worldwide (Wang et al., 2020). Due to the outstanding decentralization
    and security features of BTs, researchers, engineers, and technicians have been
    keen to develop BT and its application in wider areas such as agricultural production
    (Ai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Ma and Tsai, 2017; Ma et al., 2018; Mo et
    al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), purchasing decisions, supply chain management
    (Chang et al., 2019) and Internet of Things (Hamidi and Jahanshahifard, 2018;
    Lin et al., 2017; Mistry et al., 2020; Parada et al., 2018; Reddy et al., 2018;
    Singh and Agrawal, 2018). However, in real-world setting, e-agriculture is hindered
    by ICT limitations such are human biases, uncertainties, and lack of transparency
    and trust. A combination of ICTs and BTs could overcome these limitations, and
    thereby expand the applications of ICTs. In addition, existing studies have focused
    on ICT-based agriculture or blockchain-based farming separately; studies on the
    combined application of ICTs and BTs in agriculture are limited, resulting in
    a lack of understanding of their applications. It is of great interest to understand
    how BTs could be implemented with ICTs to enhance transparency and trust among
    actors, increase transaction efficiency, and facilitate precision e-agriculture
    schemes (Khan and Salah, 2018; Leng et al., 2018; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Similar
    barriers in ICTs and BTs have hampered the adoption of these technologies, thereby
    slowing down the development of precision agriculture. It is important to identify
    the success of ICTs and BTs in agriculture, as well as current challenges. There
    is a growing need for advanced technologies that can consolidate the existing
    scenarios (such as information acquisition, yield prediction, and product tracking),
    address present problems (such as privacy protection and high cost), and enhance
    smart agriculture for improved sustainability. To address this gap, this paper
    presents a systematic review of ICTs and BTs in e-agriculture, which contributes
    to the literature of precision agriculture in two ways. First, we review and synthesize
    the literature of these two technological applications in the agricultural sector.
    This enables us to identify the distinctiveness of each technological application
    and compile a comprehensive understanding of relations between ICTs and BTs. Second,
    we demonstrate possible avenues for research to (1) conduct comparative investigations
    of these techniques in precision agriculture; (2) study interactive effects of
    factors indicated in previous literature; (3) consider the heterogeneity of regions
    in terms of technological applications. The rest of the paper is organized as
    follows: section 2 discusses our research methodology and processes for collecting
    relevant research papers; section 3 introduces the bibliometric results of the
    collected research papers; section 4 presents the outcomes of content analysis,
    which include ICT and blockchain services, along with common challenges in e-agriculture;
    section 5 provides opportunities for future study; and section 6 concludes the
    paper. 2. Research methods This systematic review on ICTs and BTs in agriculture
    includes both bibliometric and content analyses. The combination of bibliometric
    analysis with content analysis was designed to identify the most frequent topics
    and informational gaps (Carvalho et al., 2013). The analysis processes have been
    shown in Fig. 1. Specifically, in this study, the ISI Web of Science database
    was used for sample collection. The search criteria were set as follows: (1) topics;
    “agriculture” and “ICT,” (2) periods; from 2011 to 2020, (3) filtering paper types;
    as “Article” and “Review.” This search identified 146 papers. Using the same measures,
    we searched and found 26 articles in the area of blockchain and agriculture. Then,
    we supplemented relevant literature, making the final samples 156 and 44 articles
    on ICT and BT, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (564KB) Download

    analysis quantified the publications related to our topic (Ikpaahindi, 1985).
    During the bibliometric analysis process, we employed descriptive statistics,
    which shows the number of publications during the decade (Fig. 2.1 and Fig. 2.2).
    Additionally, we utilized CiteSpace software (Chen, 2006) to conduct the co-citation
    of journals and references during the period (Chai and Xiao, 2012). This Co-citation
    analysis identified the most influential journals (Fig. 3.1 and Fig. 3.2) and
    the evolution of the most important theories (Fig. 4.1 and Fig. 4.2), which involved
    six articles on ICT and five on BT. The content analysis process included several
    phases. First, we employed CiteSpace software (Chen, 2006) to analyze keywords
    based on the frequency. Second, keyword clusters were used to assist in finding
    original research topics (Fig. 5.2.1 and Fig. 5.3.1). Third, the abstracts were
    reviewed to confirm relevance. Fourth, perspectives of industrial chains and effect
    relations were utilized to construct a complete understanding (Fig. 5.1). These
    phases involved 38 articles on ICT and 20 on BT. These articles offered important
    insights into how applications of ICT and BT improve precision agriculture. Download

    3. Bibliometric findings 3.1. Journals and year of publication Research on ICT-based
    agriculture gyrated up from 2011 to 2020 (Fig. 2.1). The division of the reviewed
    articles per publication year illustrates that 2016, 2018, and 2019 were outstanding
    dates for research on ICT-based agriculture. In terms of the publications in blockchain-based
    agriculture, although the retrieval period is from 2011 to 2020, the articles
    related to blockchain and agriculture first appeared in 2018. Beginning with a
    very finite number of articles, the number of the reviewed articles shows a rise
    since 2018 (Fig. 2.2), in particular, a significant increase in 2019. Drawing
    on the co-reference analysis, by setting citation thresholds, we found the most
    influential journals in the areas of ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture. Their
    degree of influence can be seen by the size of circles in the figures below. The
    high impact journals in ICT are shown in Fig. 3.1 and include: Agricultural Economics,
    Computers And Electronics In Agriculture, and Agricultural Systems. Various journals
    having high impact in blockchain and agriculture fields are shown in Fig. 3.2
    and include: Food Control, Future Generation Computer Systems, and Computers And
    Electronics In Agriculture. Clearly, Computers And Electronics In Agriculture
    have similarly high effects in both areas (Fig. 3.1, Fig. 3.2). 3.2. Main scholars
    and theoretical evolution The network shown in Fig. 4.1 demonstrates that the
    discussion of ICT in agriculture continually changes. Aker, J. C. (2011) reviewed
    existing programs using ICT for agriculture and categorized these programs into
    four mechanisms: voice, text, internet, and mobile money transfers through which
    ICT can facilitate agricultural adoption. Later articles mainly focused on mobile
    phones and their effects on agricultural development. Fafchamps and Minten (2012)
    emphasized its benefits in delivering market and weather information to farmers.
    Nakasone et al. (2014) further investigated the effects at the macro and micro
    levels. At the macro level, access to mobile phones can improve market performance,
    whereas they have mixed effects at the micro-level. From 2015 onward, differentiated
    research focused on the dual effects of mobile phones in agriculture. Aker and
    Fafchamps (2015) specifically discussed the beneficial impacts of mobile phone
    coverage on the reduction of spatial producer price dispersion of semi-perishable
    commodities. Although farmers increasingly utilized mobile phones for marketing
    decisions, according to Tadesse and Bahiigwa (2015), a lack of relevant information
    access inhibited the usage of mobile phones. Besides, Aker and Ksoll (2016) found
    that mobile phone coverage did not increase crop sales or farm-gate prices. The
    evolution of discussion about blockchain-based agriculture is shown in Fig. 4.2.
    Aung and Chang (2014) comprehensively explained traceability and its benefits
    in the food supply chain but did not mention blockchain applications in this field.
    Tse et al. (2017) introduced the blockchain concept and its applications in food
    supply information security. Galvez et al. (2018) and Kshetri (2018) examined
    the benefits of BTs in the supply chain. The former study found that blockchain
    can assure traceability and authenticity in the food supply chain through data
    acquisition and management, while the latter study showed that blockchain applications
    could increase transparency and accountability. Tripoli and Schmidhuber (2018)
    comprehensively discussed the benefits and barriers of applying blockchain in
    the agri-food industry. 4. Content analysis: research streams and opportunities
    This analysis was conducted as follows—after analyzing the keyword network and
    keyword clusters, to find research streams, we: (1) reviewed influences on ICT
    and BT adoption, as technique usage is the prerequisite of precision agriculture;
    (2) analyzed how ICT and BT promote precision agriculture development within the
    agricultural industry supply chain at macro levels; and (3) discussed relationships
    between variables, based on extant quantitative literature at the micro levels.
    4.1. ICT technology in agriculture We identified three dominant research streams:
    factors affecting ICT adoption, ICT application in agricultural production, and
    ICT application in agricultural networks. The findings are summarized in Fig.
    5.2.3, and the main findings are listed in Table 2.1.1 and Table 2.1.2. Table

    identified theoretical perspective. 4.1.1. Factors affecting ICT adoption Various
    factors influence the utilization of ICT-based devices in agriculture, including
    socio-demographic, farm, and application design factors. Socio-demographic factors
    are heterogeneous and include age, innovativeness, income and asset levels, degree
    of risk perception, educational level, and usage awareness. Older farmers are
    less likely to adopt the mobile internet than younger farmers (Michels et al.,
    2020; Rose et al., 2016). Additionally, more innovative farmers are more likely
    to adopt the mobile internet (Michels et al., 2020). Farmers under comfortable
    economic circumstances and less sensitive to risks are more likely to adopt ICT-based
    applications than those with a lower income and fewer productive assets (Oyinbo
    et al., 2020). Agronomists and growers with a higher education level access the
    internet more frequently (Rose et al., 2016; Wright et al., 2018). Farmers who
    recognize the usefulness of ICT tools tend to adopt the technology (Khatri-Chhetri
    et al., 2019; Mittal and Hariharan, 2018). In terms of farm elements, farmers
    of larger farms are more likely to adopt the mobile internet (Michels et al.,
    2020; Rose et al., 2016). Geographical location could be considered a proxy for
    internet access. It correlates with mobile internet adoption (Michels et al.,
    2020), and the collection of data varies among farm types (Rose et al., 2016).
    Furthermore, application design factors also influence the adoption of ICT-based
    devices. The usage of ICT-based tools is promoted by system development (Hochman
    and Carberry, 2011) and user-friendly features such as language, interface, ease-of-use,
    and information accuracy (Oyinbo et al., 2019). According to Hudson et al. (2017),
    interactivity in discussion groups and feedback to extension agents could increase
    knowledge and willingness to adopt certain practices. Participatory strategies
    including the use of interactive ICTs can help engage audiences, increase knowledge
    of agricultural improvements and innovations, and promote the adoption of ICT-based
    tools. These could be highly relevant for increasing awareness and adopting new
    agricultural practices. 4.1.2. ICT application in agricultural production: monitoring,
    information provision, and forecast There are three ICT-based applications used
    to improve farming, including monitoring agricultural practices, information provision,
    and forecasting; these are discussed below and in Table 2.1.2. ICT-based surveillance
    is critical for precision agriculture; it provides specific information to farmers
    to facilitate better practices. For example, Caceres et al. (2017) used online
    instruments that detected particular ions to monitor the performance of a constructed
    wetland; this real-time data were shared with end-users through a web app, allowing
    others to manage wetlands more effectively. Remote sensing (RS) technologies are
    used to monitor crop growth, moisture conditions, and water consumption, enabling
    farmers to provide water to crops in the right place, at the right time, and in
    appropriate quantities, in response to anticipated water stress and likely delays
    to harvesting (Amarnath et al., 2018). In addition to monitoring information,
    rural households can access other production-related information, thus improving
    their knowledge, production planning, and practical decisions about what types
    of crops are planted (e.g. Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). Kaila and Tarp
    (2019) found that internet access is associated with a higher yield because of
    more efficient fertilizer usage. Water management is yet another focus area where
    such information can be utilized. The ICT-based FieldLook platform can share flood
    information with farmers; consequently, they can store water, operate spate-irrigation
    systems, and plan growing activities in advance (Amarnath et al., 2018). An information
    system within the wireless sensor network (WSN) and ICT is beneficial for inspecting
    agricultural irrigation facilities by downloading, collecting, and updating real-time
    data (Nam et al., 2017). Combining ICT with other tools such as big data and prediction
    models can also improve process decisions and market demand perception to achieve
    precision agriculture. Perea et al. (2019) developed a new tool that will help
    irrigation district managers in their daily decision making relating to water
    and energy use. The results show that the developed model improved the prediction
    accuracy between 3% and 11%. Simultaneously, employing a sliding window-based
    support vector regression (multi-modal SW-SVR) method, Kaneda et al. (2017) proposed
    a novel multi-model for accurately predicting complex water stress situations.
    In another example of the use of the model for water management, Godara and Toshniwal
    (2020) built prediction systems to forecast problems for Indian farmers. 4.1.3.
    ICTs in agricultural networks: functions in other segments of the industrial chain,
    and re-creating networks There is minimal research on the application of ICT in
    logistics and consumption compared to ICT application in production. In logistics,
    ICT technologies are applied to product tracking and monitoring, such as movements
    and environmental impacts (Lehmann et al., 2012), while for consumption, efficient
    markets are the goal that ICTs can help to realize. The use of information and
    services can help to implement postharvest management and marketing (Ali and Kumar,
    2011). Dube et al. (2020) found that ICT applications can increase consumption.
    By drawing on price information provided by a third-party, farmers can match supply
    and demand, thereby reducing geographic price dispersion (Parker et al., 2016).
    Another significant role of ICTs in agriculture is to create collaborations and
    alliances (Vallauri, 2014). Aimed at empowerment, enablement, and market expansion,
    measures have been taken by state governments and private organizations to improve
    ICT for agricultural extension (Lele and Goswami, 2017). Actors (NGOs, broadcasters,
    technology providers, agricultural partners, and government agencies) in the value
    chain collaborate for providing cultivation and market information to smallholders
    (Dong et al., 2020; Karanasios and Slavova, 2019; Shao et al., 2020; Yang et al.,
    2019)). Digital Platform (DP) is an example of a tool that generates new networks
    and forms of cooperation in the value chain of maize crops, and it helps to initiate
    an entry point for recalibrating trust perceptions (Agyekumhene et al., 2018).
    ICTs introduce transparency that strengthens trust and allows farmers to renegotiate
    existing relationships (Slavova and Karanasios, 2018). 4.2. Blockchain technology
    (BT) in agriculture Blockchain is a distributed knowledge system incorporating
    six components: consensus algorithm, network model, CAP theorem (consistency,
    availability, and tolerance of partitions), smart contracts, interplanetary file
    system, and security analysis (Prashar et al., 2020), which can provide the digital
    infrastructure for a wide array of applications relevant to sustainable development
    (Bierbaum et al., 2020). Using the same methods described in 4.1, we found three
    dominant research themes in the area of blockchain-based agriculture: the effect
    of factors on BT implementation, applications of BT in the holistic supply chain,
    and applications of BT in every segment of the agricultural supply chain. As Fig.
    5.3.1 shows, keywords and clusters demonstrate major research directions. Final
    research themes with details are listed in Fig. 5.3.2, Table 2.2.1 and Table 2.2.2.

    4.2.1. Influences on BT implementation As BT is still in its early stages of development,
    we found only one study (Kamble et al., 2020a) on the effects of BT implementation
    on the agricultural industry. The authors found that traceability, provenance,
    immutability, and auditability are the main areas of agricultural practice where
    BTs can be applied. Traceability allows any information to be traced back via
    the timestamp. Provenance is maintained because BT creates a unique fingerprint
    (a digital token) for each of the products at different stages, allowing products
    to be traced back to their origins. Immutability refers to unchanging features
    that provide an immutable audit trail and reduce susceptibility to manipulation
    or forgery of data. In terms of auditability, the decentralized database of BT
    makes transactions visible to its participants, thus maintaining an audit trail
    and increasing auditability. 4.2.2. Applications of blockchain in the holistic
    supply chain Most extant articles focus on traceability and visibility, which
    can increase transparency. Other articles emphasize the automation of blockchain
    applications in the supply chain, which improves efficiency. 4.2.2.1. Realization
    mechanisms of traceability, visibility, and automation: shared ledgers and smart
    contracts Building a decentralized network requires a shared ledger. As a distributed
    ledger technology, BT can leverage its potential to achieve the synchronization,
    sharing, and visibility of tracking information (Chang et al., 2019). Blockchains
    comprise data records; as each transaction occurs, it is put into a block that
    is connected to the one before and after it. In a blockchain, the entire dataset
    is visible to all parties. Each party can verify the transaction records of the
    partners directly. The verification process can effectively secure data on blockchain
    ledgers against unauthorized access or manipulation (Wang et al., 2019a). The
    smart contract is the computer code that can operate on the blockchain platform
    to construct agreements and promptly track changes in process status among suppliers,
    manufacturers, logistics service providers, distributors, and customers. Specifically,
    supply chain participants share their ledgers via blockchain systems. A smart
    contract can then complete transactions automatically upon fulfillment of contract
    conditions (Hang et al., 2020) and track status changes. Through the mutual registration
    of dual participants on smart contracts, all participants can track status changes
    (Chang et al., 2019). 4.2.2.2. Outcomes of traceability, visibility, and automation
    Traceability and visibility secure information authenticity, improve transparency
    and information security, and also build trust. The goal of traceability is to
    verify the origins and processes of items, as well as to present tamper-proof
    information to all stakeholders in the supply chain (Prashar et al., 2020). BT
    can trace items at different points of processing or packaging, enhancing trade
    transparency (Rao et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019). For example, WasteLedger has
    applied blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies to track waste products
    throughout the entire supply chain, while Earth Bank of Codes was developed to
    trace genetic resources (Bierbaum et al., 2020). Visibility can promote product
    traceability from producers to end-users, improving trust among all members of
    the supply chain (Wang et al., 2019b). Trust is gradually embedded in the blockchain
    technological platform as traceability and visibility are increased, thus enhancing
    relationships between supply chain partners (Bumblauskas et al., 2020; Wang et
    al., 2019b). It is efficient to improve the potential for synchronization and
    automation of operational processes using smart contracts in a multi-agent system
    to manage the entire supply chain process (Chang et al., 2019). This is because
    smart contracts remove intermediaries and are programmed to activate commencements
    of subsequent processes such as payment transactions. Through the proper deployment
    of such contracts, labor forces can be more-or-less replaced or transformed to
    achieve automatic execution of the process. This can reduce costs and time associated
    with queries and confirmation in the transit process and accelerate the data exchange
    among parties (Wang et al., 2019b), thereby improving efficiency in agricultural
    supply chains (Mistry et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2020). 4.2.3. Applications of
    BT in every segment of agriculture 4.2.3.1. Application of blockchain in information
    provision BT application contributes to data collection, exchange, and analysis,
    which supports small farmers in decision making, thereby improving productivity
    and sustainability. By using BTs, practitioners can acquire information regarding
    factors including crops, pesticides, fertilizers, machinery, weather conditions,
    animals, and financial transactions (Kamilaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020).
    This real-time information and analysis can enable data-driven decision making
    and improve the quality and quantity of resultant agricultural products, thereby
    contributing to agricultural productivity and sustainability (Mistry et al., 2020;
    Sharma et al., 2020). For example, the Smart Watering System using the blockchain
    and Fuzzy Logic approach can help farmers capture objective data from plants and
    the environment that can be used to make effective decisions about optimal watering
    schedules (Munir et al., 2019). 4.2.3.2. Applications of blockchain in logistics
    and consumption As for logistics, the main role of BT is similar to its role in
    the supply chain: increase traceability and transparency. BTs can help users to
    acquire information about shipping details, trajectories, storage conditions (e.g.,
    temperature and humidity), and time in transit (Astill et al., 2019; Kamilaris
    et al., 2019), all of which increase transparency in the transaction process (Astill
    et al., 2019). With regard to consumption, consumers can use a mobile phone to
    scan the QR code (a matrix two-dimensional code symbol) to ascertain details associated
    with the food item, such as quality and quantity, expiration dates, storage conditions,
    and time spent on the shelf. This enables consumers to obtain fair pricing and
    increases their perception of quality related to purchasing decisions (Kamilaris
    et al., 2019; Sander et al., 2018, Fig. 5.3.2). 5. Discussion Through our comparison
    of ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture and its challenges, we have identified

    is in the ICT or BT area. 2. × represents this challenge is not in the ICT or
    BT area. 5.1. Possible future research - based on a comparison of applications
    5.1.1. Influences on technology adoption As for factors affecting ICT adoption,
    socio-demographic and design factors can have an effect on whether practitioners
    choose to use these applications in agricultural practice (see section 4.1.1).
    A single study (Kamble et al., 2020a) on BT usage illustrates technologically
    relevant factors such as traceability, auditability, immutability, and provenance
    (see section 4.2.1); these can help designers prioritize certain functions when
    designing applications. Referring to factors affecting ICT adoption, future research
    on BT adoption should consider socio-demographic factors and other design elements.
    Socio-demographic factors include age, income and asset levels, degree of risk
    perception, educational level, and usage awareness, while design elements include
    language, interface, ease-of-use, and information accuracy. 5.1.2. Technological
    applications in agriculture ICT and BT have similar applications in the fields
    of production and logistics within agriculture. In the area of production, ICT
    and BT can provide farmers with information, which can improve their decision
    making and promote productivity. In logistics, product tracing is the main function
    of ICT- and BT-based applications. Our review investigations have shown that there
    is little research on the applications of ICT and BT in distribution (retailing)
    areas. Hence, future studies could investigate how ICT and BT impact distribution
    in the agricultural sector. Having considered the similarities in the roles above,
    there are differences between these two technological applications. For example,
    in relation to consumption, ICT focuses on market efficiency, with extant articles
    considering how to maximize the balance of supply and demand to reduce price dispersion.
    Whereas in consumption research, BT is applied to show product details that consumers
    depend on for decisions; however, there is little discussion about which factors
    influence purchasing decisions, and this is an opportunity for future research.
    Another difference is in the functions of ICT and BT in the whole supply chain.
    ICT is more focused on production improvements, while BT emphasizes transparency
    (trust) and automation (efficiency). Despite little research on ICT in trust-building,
    trust plays a crucial role in relationships among actors in the supply chain.
    Further research should investigate influential factors on trust-building among
    stakeholders. BT smart contracts promote trust-building and collaboration automatically,
    which creates efficiency improvements and benefits the whole industry; future
    research could address the impacts of automation realization, from social and
    technological perspectives. 5.2. Opportunities based on challenges 5.2.1. Challenges
    of ICT-based agriculture Bacco et al. (2019) and Chae and Cho (2018) found that
    data ownership, protection, and security do not meet the demand of farmers. More
    specifically, digital solutions for precision agriculture are under-utilized as
    farmers are afraid of data misuse and the loss of control over their businesses.
    Insufficient infrastructure is another challenge, which impacts the speed of moving
    raw data from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms such as edge computing.
    Additionally, there is an urban-rural digital divide in terms of internet and
    broadband access. This is a crucial inhibitor to edge computation that supports
    interoperability and scalability (O’Grady et al., 2019). To solve problems of
    interoperability, Kruize et al. (2016) use a design-oriented research approach
    to develop a reference architecture in Software Ecosystem (SE) that can fulfill
    the following integration requirements: data handling and exchange, flexible configuration
    (e.g., customized ICT), interoperability, and organizational collaboration. However,
    by comparing the proposed SE to real-world farm SE, they found that the real-world
    scenario did not reflect the conditions necessary for configuration, and ideas
    of how this inconsistency should be handled are not yet well-developed. In addition,
    the relationships between SE and edge computation are unclear. Socioeconomic barriers
    also inhibit the diffusion of precision agriculture. Although adoption costs have
    decreased gradually, cost issues still keep farmers from considering ICT-based
    techniques (Aker, J. C., 2011; Bacco et al., 2019; Hudson et al., 2017; Lele and
    Goswami, 2017; Varghese and Buyya, 2018). Farmers are concerned about investment
    recovery time and difficulties of utilization (Bacco et al., 2019). Therefore,
    incentives and policies will play a significant role in facilitating technology
    improvement and alleviating socioeconomic issues. Financial and non-financial
    incentives, such as training, are influential solutions (Bacco et al., 2019);
    governments could take responsibility for introducing uniform data standards to
    offer exclusive cross-manufacturer and cross-platform applications (Munz et al.,
    2020). 5.2.2. Challenges of blockchain-based agriculture Concerns about the application
    of blockchain are the privacy of users and data security (Zhao et al., 2019).
    There are potentially hacking risks of devices embedded into agricultural supply
    chains, which could result in either illegally-collected data or manipulated device
    function (Astill et al., 2019). As it is, the information on the blockchain is
    available to all the participants who belong to the blockchain network (Leng et
    al., 2018; Lezoche et al., 2020). In the agri-food value chain, members are in
    competitive relationships and do not value the transparent traceability system.
    Scalability is another challenge that relates to latency (Lezoche et al., 2020;
    Zhao et al., 2019). To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary
    to have a large number of full nodes that validate each transaction in the blockchain
    (Reyna et al., 2018). As the blockchain size constantly grows, an oversized chain
    has negative effects on performance because it increases the synchronization time.
    Also, the number of transactions and time between blocks influence the computational
    power and transaction confirmation times. A latency issue is incurred in the transaction
    capacity of blockchain, which is restricted to seven transactions per second;
    thus, the time processing transactions increases (Reyna et al., 2018). The high
    cost, high consumption, and high knowledge demands of blockchain have been seriously
    questioned. As for costs, users are prepared to invest significant funds to embed
    BT into current agri-food systems (Wang et al., 2019b). Increased energy consumption
    also has to be expected, as complexity requires more computational power to confirm
    more blocks (Sander et al., 2018). For example, the bitcoin network is currently
    estimated to consume about 2.5 GW of electricity (i.e., approximately the energy
    consumption of Ireland). High knowledge demands also limit the blockchain adoption
    in agriculture because it is crucial to have in-depth knowledge and skills about
    how to utilize the blockchain in agri-food management (Zhao et al., 2019). The
    absence of policies and regulations is another challenge. First, large fluctuations
    of cryptocurrency value reduce the public trust in BT. This has general negative
    effects on the reputation of blockchain, slowing the adoption of this technology
    in agriculture (Kamilaris et al., 2019). This situation persists because of a
    lack of relevant policies and regulations which can control speculative behavior
    and reduce volatility in financial markets. Second, global agricultural industry
    chains involve various stakeholders in the blockchain application, but there are
    no laws or regulations for them to follow. This lack of censorship creates many
    uncertainties (Zhao et al., 2019). Clearly, it will be necessary to introduce
    new standards, laws, or regulations—enforceable internationally—to monitor and
    regulate the application of blockchain in the agri-food industry (Hughes et al.,
    2019). 5.2.3. Future research related to specific challenges 5.2.3.1. Security
    and privacy A lack of data security and privacy negatively affects the precision
    of the process, as farmers are apprehensive of data theft during data transfer
    to external systems. Furthermore, members in the supply chain are not willing
    to share their data with competitors in a transparent system. Although various
    schemes, such as ring signatures, for data security and privacy have been applied
    to blockchain-based agriculture, there are no schemes to hide transaction information
    of senders and receivers and the amount at the same time (Zhao et al., 2019).
    Therefore, data control and protection are important in ICT- and blockchain-based
    agriculture. In the future, studies should focus on how to simultaneously conceal
    multi-party transaction information in theoretical research and technological
    practices. In addition, the roles and functions of governments in promoting this
    new technology should be evaluated. It is also crucial to evaluate (i) how data
    users regulate their behavior and thus contribute to data protection, and (ii)
    how to reduce reservation of data sharing in ICT- and blockchain-based farming.
    5.2.3.2. Scalability and interoperability Scalability problems feature in the
    discussion of both ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture. Crucial issues of scalability
    and interoperability have not received sufficient consideration in ICT-based agriculture,
    while latency problems inhibit scalability in BT. The integration of various techniques
    into blockchain, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, has already
    been suggested and extended into education and academia for sustainability (Biswas
    et al., 2018; Lezoche et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2019). These programs and studies
    can educate professionals with specific knowledge such as networking, computing,
    and programming. Then they can apply their knowledge into innovation (technology,
    product, pattern, organization, and market) for sustainable development. Research
    on innovation systems and Triple Helix (TH) models has revealed that cooperation
    among firms and universities can help to boost innovation and economic development
    (Khan and Park, 2013; Li et al., 2018). Future research can employ innovation
    systems or TH approaches to discuss technology innovation and the transfer of
    ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture. Simultaneously, universities have an underlying
    role in helping the movement of human societies toward sustainable development
    (Monavvarifard et al., 2019). Therefore, it is logical for universities to hold
    courses, conduct research, and create programs for ICT- and blockchain-based education
    to promote these technologies. 5.2.3.3. High cost, high consumption, and high
    knowledge demands The fear of investment recovery in the application of ICT and
    BTs in agriculture is a concern. Future opportunities can use TRIZ theory (Theory
    of Inventive Problem Solving) to improve technologies to reduce costs. At macro
    levels, governments use financial and non-financial means to encourage technological
    innovation and diffusion, which help to reduce costs gradually. Political scholars
    need to investigate how to influence policymakers most effectively to formulate
    appropriate policies for promoting technology innovation (Guan and Yam, 2015;
    Shu et al., 2015). The main problems with high consumption relate to the volume
    of electricity usage and carbon dioxide emissions, which contradict the goal of
    being a low-carbon and sustainable environment. Using the Drive-Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response
    (DFPSR) model, a systematic indicator to measure environmental and sustainable
    development can be derived; future investigations can conduct comparative analyses
    on agricultural development, based on various ICTs and the application of blockchains,
    to identify and promote eco-friendly programs. Likewise, it is also important
    to improve green technologies in the development of ICT and blockchain. 5.2.3.4.
    Policies and regulations Barriers to policies and regulations are the absence
    of uniform standards with which participants can comply. These standards improve
    market stability by regulating the behavior of practitioners, increasing public
    trust and technology adoption. Future research can study standards and policies
    in the agricultural industry; however, it should be noted that implementation
    of uniform standards strongly depends on actors in the industrial chain who leverage
    it to develop equipment, systems, hardware, and software. Future research should
    also consider the different functions and roles of governments in enforcing standards
    at different stages. In the infancy phase, studies can investigate how authorities
    integrate resources, coordinate, solve conflicts, and encourage more initiatives
    to improve the effects of these two technologies in agriculture. In the developing
    phase, the research should focus on how to transfer policies or regulations of
    policy guidance into market guidance, and subsequently, how to consolidate marketization
    outcomes. 6. Conclusion In response to a lack of understanding of their usage,
    this study was undertaken to investigate how ICT and BT technologies had been
    adopted in the development of precision agriculture. Technique adoption is the
    prerequisite to their application. ICT technique adoption is affected by application
    design factors and socio-demographic factors, while research in BTs only focuses
    on application design factors. Our analysis suggests that there is an omission
    involved in the socio-demographic impacts of BT adoption. Considering these factors
    will be beneficial for empirical testing, including evaluating important influences
    on BT implementation. As for the application of technology in precision agricultural
    practice, ICTs and BTs have similar applications in information provision in agricultural
    production, tracing in logistics, and trust-building in the supply chain. However,
    in areas of ICT-based agriculture, research to date mainly focuses on the application
    of ICT in production practices, whereas studies in blockchain-based agriculture
    pay more attention to transparency and efficiency in the supply chain. In terms
    of consumption, ICTs focus on the balance of supply and demand, while BTs investigate
    effects on consumer purchasing decisions. Our comparison reveals that BT applications
    can extend ICT-based agriculture practice from production to the whole industry.
    The information transparency and transaction automation consolidate ICT-based
    scenarios and make up for uncertainties. Most importantly, this expressed viewpoint
    provides a starting point for further proposed investigation into how these two
    techniques affect and improve precision agriculture. Moreover, four barriers are
    identified in ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture for future opportunities:
    security and privacy, scalability and interoperability, high cost, consumption,
    and knowledge demands, and the lack of policies and regulations related to standard
    criteria for market stability. In order to address each barrier, recommendations—innovation
    system theory for technology innovation, TH models for ICT and blockchain development,
    TRIZ theory for technique improvement to reduce cost, and the DFPSR model to identify
    and promote eco-friendly programs—are suggested for governments, firms, and universities
    to investigate these technologies further. While all these identified opportunities
    for further investigation need attention, it is noted that research or theoretical
    studies will take some time. In contrast, there are some practical measures that
    could be implemented more quickly and would, directly or indirectly, benefit the
    situation. Some security and privacy issues could be alleviated by educational
    programs reinforced with the development of policy and regulatory frameworks.
    The article has a few limitations. The ISI Web of Science was used as the database
    for the systematic literature review. It is likely that we missed a few significant
    studies that are not available in the ISI Web of Science database. Therefore,
    future research should include other databases besides the ISI Web of Science.
    Moreover, the findings presented herein are based on the systematic literature
    review, necessitating further research to validate the findings empirically. In
    summary, although the literature reviewed on ICT and BT in precision agriculture
    highlights the tremendous progress in the field, there are important practical
    barriers and knowledge gaps that are slowing the implementation of these technologies
    and, more generally, the development of sustainable precision agriculture. We
    hope that this enhanced understanding will lead to improved knowledge and better
    managerial guidance for the implementation of precision agriculture using ICT
    and BT. CRediT authorship contribution statement Wei Liu: Investigation, Supervision,

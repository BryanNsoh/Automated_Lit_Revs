    plays a decisive role in the survival of humankind. The efficient and precise
    regulation of agriculture will ensure the welfare of people throughout the world.
    However, difficult and urgent agricultural challenges persist, and traditional
    agricultural production regulation methods are time consuming and laborious. Moreover,
    the application of intelligent algorithms to modern agricultural production requires
    the support of a database, which can be complex and difficult to use in practice
    and requires a large amount of computing. Fortunately, model predictive control
    (MPC) methods can achieve highly accurate control operations with moderate complexity
    and can also allow for rolling optimization in a limited time domain, which improves
    precision. Despite being a process control method that originated in industry,
    MPC is highly suited for application in agriculture because it can effectively
    address nonlinear and large time-delay systems. The aim of this review is to introduce
    MPC and describe its current application in agriculture. In this review, the development
    of MPC and various improved MPC schemes are described. The development of MPC
    is divided into three stages. In addition, applications and new technologies associated
    with MPC in irrigation systems, agricultural machinery, agricultural production,
    product processing and greenhouses are analyzed. Smart agriculture will have a
    promising future because of the implementation of MPC technologies derived from
    successful industrial applications. Finally, challenges and future perspectives
    of MPC technology use in agriculture are summarized and forecasted. Previous article

    1. Introduction Agriculture is the foundation of human existence, it is vital
    to the survival of humankind. Today, the total global population exceeds 7 billion,
    and by 2050, the urban population will increase by an additional 2.5 billion through
    population growth and urbanization, with nearly 90% of the population concentrated
    in Asia and Africa (Lloyd et al., 2017). However, the amount of available food
    is limited, especially in Africa, and the food scarcity problem has yet to be
    solved (Sanchez, 2002); additionally, Asia has a serious shortage of water (Pomeranz,
    2009). The earth''s water supply is rich, with 1.45 billion cubic kilometers in
    total, and 72% of the Earth’s surface area is covered with water. However, less
    than 1% of the world’s fresh water is easy to exploit for direct human use, accounting
    for approximately 0.007% of the total water on the planet. The total land area
    of the world exceeds 13 billion hectares; however, the area of potentially arable
    land throughout the world accounts for 22% of the total land area, at just 3031
    million hectares (Lal, 1990). Moreover, traditional agriculture is time-consuming
    and labor-intensive, with low production efficiency. Considering the increasing
    population, water shortages, limited land resources, and low production efficiency,
    it is urgent to efficiently regulate agriculture. Agricultural systems are complex,
    multivariate and unpredictable (Kamilaris et al., 2018). Classical control technologies
    such as those involving on/off, P, proportional integral (PI), and proportion-integration-differentiation
    (PID) control (Christofides et al., 2013, Afram and Janabi-Sharifi, 2014) are
    easy to implement but are unable to control moving processes with time delays;
    in addition, adjusting the controller is cumbersome and time consuming (Wang et
    al., 2001). Intelligent methods such as fuzzy logic (FL) control and artificial
    neural network (ANN) control involve not only deterministic mathematical models
    but also nonmathematical generalized models and mixed models (Afram and Janabi-Sharifi,
    2014). However, these methods require learning and reasoning based on data-driven
    or embedded expert knowledge. Fortunately, the performance of MPC is superior
    to that of classical control and is easier to implement than intelligent computing
    algorithms. MPC can achieve high regulation accuracy with moderate complexity.
    Therefore, this method is highly suited for precision agricultural production.
    MPC refers to a class of advanced computer-controlled algorithms that use an explicit
    process model to predict a plant''s future response (Qin and Badgwell, 2003).
    A series of control inputs are computed at each sampling instant, but only the
    first computed input is implemented in the process (Bumroongsri and Kheawhom,
    2014). The first input in the optimal sequence is then sent to the factory, and
    the entire calculation is repeated at subsequent control intervals (Mogal and
    Warke, 2013). The algorithm consists of three parts: prediction model, rolling
    optimization, and feedback adjustment (Zhang, et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2017b,
    Zhang et al., 2017c). MPC was developed in the early 1960s and has been used widely
    in process industries (Garriga and Soroush, 2010). The method allows for the introduction
    of constraints, predictive information, and nonlinear dynamics. Linear MPC (LMPC)
    is used to solve convex quadratic programming problems (QPs) online. Nonlinear
    MPC (NMPC) allows for the control of systems with nonlinear dynamics and involves
    significantly more calculation than does LMPC (Vukov et al., 2015). Early MPC
    theory incorporated dynamic matrix control (DMC) and model algorithm control (MAC),
    which are based on the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG), which is a relatively
    simple parameter model. Internal model control (IMC) is defined for single-input/single-output,
    discrete-time systems (Garcia and Morari, 1982). DMC and MAC inspired the development
    of IMC but lacked stability. Thus, the generalized predictive control (GPC) model
    was developed; its theoretical basis is more complete than DMC and MAC, and it
    could also solve the robustness problem to a certain extent. Most industrial processes
    are highly complex, involve large amounts of interference and are strongly nonlinear;
    thus, adaptive MPC, robust MPC and NMPC have been developed. However, the calculation
    time for these MPCs is quite long and inefficient. To solve these problems, the
    distributed MPC, hybrid MPC, explicit MPC and other new MPC models were established
    (Lee, 2011). In addition, because actual production processes are random, stochastic
    MPCs have also been developed (Zhang, et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2017b, Zhang
    et al., 2017c). As one of the most promising control strategies, MPC has been
    widely studied (Froisy, 1994, Morari and Lee, 1999, Qin and Badgwell, 2003, Rawlings
    and Mayne, 2009) and applied in industry (Qin, 1997, Seki et al., 2001, Han and
    Qiao, 2014). The application of MPC to agriculture can yield significant productivity
    and efficiency benefits. However, no review of MPC use in agricultural applications
    has been reported. MPC has been applied to agriculture, but it has not yet been
    applied in all respects. In this review, MPC development and current application
    in agriculture are described. The development of MPC can be divided into three
    stages: classical MPC, improved MPC, and the latest MPC. These MPCs are described
    in Chapter 2. Currently, MPC is used mainly in agricultural applications such
    as irrigation systems, machinery, production, product processing, and greenhouses.
    These applications are described in Chapter 3. The challenges and future perspectives
    of MPC are discussed in Chapter 4. Finally, conclusions are discussed. 2. The
    development of MPC In the 1960s and 1970s, the concept of MPC appeared in the
    literature. However, MPC was not introduced into process industries until the
    1980s (Froisy, 1994). In general, the evolution of this scheme can be divided
    into three stages according to the degree of technological development. The theoretical
    principle of MPC is shown in Fig. 1. The input is , the initial output is , the
    output after optimization is , and the output after on-line correction is ; after
    a number of repeated cycles, the final output is y(k). Download : Download high-res

    purpose of the first-generation MPC scheme was to solve typical multivariable
    constraint control problems in industry. Many algorithms emerged during this period.
    Herein, DMC, MAC, and GPC are introduced, which are relatively classical, and
    other algorithms established during this period are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

    matrix control and model algorithm control Early MPCs, such as LQG controllers
    (Kalman, 1960), were unable to handle constraints, process nonlinearity or uncertainty.
    Later, DMC and MAC systematically introduced input and output constraints to address
    some of the drawbacks of LQG (Garriga and Soroush, 2010). DMC is a significant
    and classical predictive control method first proposed by Culter and Ramakar (Cutler
    and Ramakar, 1980). This method uses a step-response model (SRM) that is relatively
    easy to develop in practice (Moon and Lee, 2011). Studies have shown that DMC
    could sometimes be combined with PID to improve the performance of DMC (Guo et
    al., 2010, Wu et al., 2014). In addition, nonlinear systems with high efficiency
    are consistently described by many SRMs (Moon and Lee, 2011). Quadratic dynamic
    matrix control (QDMC) is also commonly used. This algorithm can reduce the cost
    of a given system (Li et al., 2012). Richalet et al. established the original
    concept of MAC in the late 1970s (Richalet et al., 1978a, Richalet et al., 1978b).
    MAC essentially involves an impulse response model, a reference trajectory, an
    optimality criterion and state and control constraints (Xia et al., 1993). The
    purpose of MAC is to obtain an optimal control strategy for minimizing the relevant
    criterion, which reflects future deviations within a certain range (Zhang et al.,
    2009). The combination of MAC with PID can also improve the performance of MAC
    (Wei, 2015). Regardless of model structure and order, the DMC and MAC schemes
    include fixed time-delay terms. The disadvantage is that these methods cannot
    describe unstable systems, are not applicable to unstable objects, and cannot
    easily perform online model identification. 2.1.2. Generalized predictive control
    The GPC model was first developed in 1987 by Clarke et al., 1987a, Clarke, et
    al., 1987b. The principle of GPC is to generate a series of control signals at
    each sample interval to optimize the control effort to track the reference trajectory
    accurately (Lu and Tsai, 2009). The core idea is to develop a control strategy
    that can adapt to dynamic changes in the sampling rate. (Pawlowski et al., 2012a,
    Pawlowski et al., 2012b). The purpose of GPC is to replace the self-regulating
    regulator to solve robustness problems (Lee, 2011). GPC can be used with the CARIMA
    model to improve performance (Kiselev et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016). Predictive
    control (PC) can control simple to highly complex processes, including those involving
    large time delays, nonminimal phases, unstable and multivariable systems (Aguilar
    et al., 2016). GPC has the advantages of both self-tuning control and PC, and
    feedback correction is implemented in a self-tuning manner through online model
    identification and online control law correction. GPC can control open-loop instability,
    nonminimum phases, and time-varying delay objects and exhibits good robustness
    to time-delay and order-indeterminate systems. However, GPC is difficult to be
    deploy in multivariable systems. In addition, different companies using early
    MPC technologies have had unique sets of problems to address. Some technologies
    have become known by their commercial software product names, which are still
    used today. In general, these technologies are also known as MPCs and are briefly
    described in Table 1. 2.2. Improved MPC The classical MPC schemes cannot meet
    complex industrial requirements. The purpose of the next generation of MPC, referred
    to as improved MPC, was to address the robustness and nonlinearity of control
    problems. 2.2.1. Adaptive MPC Generally, control problems involve many unmeasurable
    parameters and uncertainties, which, to some extent, decrease the performance
    of MPC. One solution is to update the model parameters offline through state measurements.
    However, adaptive extensions of MPC with online parameter estimation and control
    are more attractive (Adetola et al., 2009). Therefore, adaptive MPC was developed,
    which considers constraints of the process input, output and state variables (Sadjadi
    and Mohammad, 2013, Adetola and Guay, 2011). In addition, in adaptive MPC, the
    computation time of the NMPC model is less than that of the GPC model (Akpan and
    Hassapis, 2011). Although some adaptive MPC methods have been applied to linear
    systems, few adaptive MPC methods have been developed for nonlinear systems (Adetola
    et al., 2009). In addition, it is difficult to guarantee the implementation of
    constraints under an adaptive mechanism. Moreover, when using adaptive MPC, it
    may be very difficult to theoretically guarantee stability and feasibility (Fukushima
    et al., 2007). 2.2.2. Robust MPC Although MPC has some inherent robustness as
    a feedback control method, it is still not sufficiently robust to address complex
    industrial processes. The min-max MPC formulation is important for incorporating
    the concepts of robust control into MPC (Lee, 2014). The purpose of robust control
    is to design controllers that maintain stability and performance despite model
    inaccuracies or uncertainties (Camacho and Berenguel, 2015). Robust MPC integrated
    with a neural network was able to address a min-max optimization problem (Pan
    and Wang, 2008, Yan and Wang, 2011). Adding an integral action to robust MPC (RMPC + I)
    provided good robustness and good steady-state characteristics (Akçakaya and Sümer,
    2009). For large-scale systems, a robust distributed MPC with time delays could
    minimize the upper limit of a robust performance target (Zhang et al., 2014).
    This approach could maintain robust stability by simplifying goals and uncertainty
    descriptions to solve problems and make online work easy to manage. However, actual
    production applications are much more complex. Robust MPC has been widely researched
    theoretically, but most results are not applicable to hardware implementation;
    the controllers are simply conceptual. Thus, further study of robust MPC is crucial,
    and an improved MPC scheme with greater robustness is needed. 2.2.3. Nonlinear
    MPC Indeed, most industrial processes are not as simple as they are described
    in theory; they are nonlinear with large delays and strong perturbations. NMPC
    is required to operate under these conditions. Froisy proposed that second-order
    Volterra models could bridge the gap between linear empirical models and nonlinear
    basic models (Froisy, 1994). Although NMPC can address multiple-input/multiple-output
    (MIMO) systems and constraints, it is not as widely used in industry as linear
    MPC, mainly because the calculation time required for convergence is not negligible
    (Wolf and Marquardt, 2016). To achieve real-time NMPC, Houska et al. presented
    an automatic C-code generation strategy (Houska et al., 2011). The inherent nonconvexity
    makes it very expensive for NMPC to settle to global optimality. Harinath et al.
    introduced a scheme that described nonlinear dynamical systems and constraints
    through polynomial functions (Harinath et al., 2016). For nonlinear systems with
    large delays and strong perturbations, NMPC is a better choice. However, its calculation
    time is too long, and it is more expensive than MPC. Future research on NMPC should
    address the method’s limitations and broaden its application. Unlike classical
    models, the new generation of MPC schemes has incorporated software that uses
    more standard state space models and related tools, such as the Kalman filter.
    The stability of the mathematical properties of these schemes has been successfully
    established. 2.3. Latest MPC With continuously increasing performance and computing
    time requirements, more advanced MPCs have been developed. The purpose of this
    latest generation of MPC is to decrease calculation times (Lee, 2011). 2.3.1.
    Hybrid MPC, tube-based MPC, stochastic MPC In the 1990s, researchers began to
    solve the problem of controlling hybrid systems involving continuous and discrete
    dynamics (Ghasemi and Afzalian, 2017). Hybrid MPC is a system with logical rules
    and continuous dynamical and logical rules. Bemporad et al. extended MPC to hybrid
    systems based on the mixed logical dynamical (MLD) modeling framework (Bemporad
    and Morari, 1999). In addition, the solution of hybrid MPC can be rewritten as
    a series of optimization problems, a method known as mixed integer quadratic programming
    (MIQP), but the computation is complex. However, transforming the MIQP into an
    easier quadratic program (QP) could save significant computation time (Mendes
    et al., 2017). In plant operation, hybrid MPC systems can increase profits (Singh
    et al., 2015). There are many ways to obtain parallelism for a hybrid MPC, yet
    it is unclear what method should be used to achieve the highest possible performance.
    Tube-based MPC and stochastic MPC have also drawn much attention. The purpose
    of tube-based MPC is to preserve all possible trajectories of uncertain systems
    within a tube, the center of which is obtained by solving the nominal system with
    more restrictive, conventional MPC. The size of the tube is limited by the local
    controller, which tries to redirect all trajectories of the uncertain system to
    the center track (Ghasemi and Afzalian, 2017). Tube-based MPC is always combined
    with other methods, such as robust tube-based MPC (Limon et al., 2010, Ghasemi
    and Afzalian, 2017) and explicit tube-based MPC (Bayer et al., 2016). Tube-based
    MPC can improve the robustness of a control system to a certain extent. However,
    this method weakens the consideration of system disturbances. Modeling and measurements
    always involve many random uncertainties. Some scholars (Kouvaritakis et al.,
    2010, Cannon et al., 2011) have put forward stochastic MPC (SMPC) strategies,
    which explicitly use probabilistic information about additive disturbances to
    minimize the expected value of a predicted cost subject to hard and soft constraints
    (Cannon et al., 2012). These methods consider the stochastic features of the uncertainties,
    allow for the frequency of constraint violations to be lower than an expected
    threshold (Dai et al., 2016) and aim to solve stochastic disturbances and model
    uncertainties of systems through statistics by describing the stochastic characteristics
    of uncertainty. Cannon et al. found that using stochastic tube MPC could achieve
    nearly the best performance under soft constraint conditions (Cannon et al., 2012).
    The basic feature of many SMPC methods is the characterization of noise properties,
    which is a critical point that can lead to problems with reliability and robustness
    under nonideal conditions. In some simulation studies, the potential of SMPC in
    many areas has been explored, but its use in practice is limited. 2.3.2. Distributed
    MPC MPC is generally achieved in a centralized manner; however, in large-scale
    systems, distributed MPC (DMPC) is more useful (Pannocchia, 2015). DMPC can address
    the action of other agents with respect to their future intention and while making
    decisions about the agent’s own control actions (Alrifaee et al., 2016). This
    strategy can also prevent loss of information, reduce calculation time, and address
    interferences. Decentralized and hierarchical structures have been developed and
    applied. The differences between these four structures are shown in Fig. 3. Download

    and d. hierarchical MPC. The DMPC method is among the superior technologies used
    to address complex control problems, and many subsystems are interconnected. This
    method allows for the allocation of decisions under system constraints. In addition,
    because information is communicated between intelligent agents, the performance
    of the distributed MPC scheme is better than that of conventional decentralized
    MPC. For example, buildings consist of many connected compartments, which requires
    the use of DMPC (Barata et al., 2014). DMPC can also be used to handle the disturbances
    in railway networks (Kersbergen et al., 2016) and for the optimal operation of
    a smart grid distributed energy system (Stadler et al., 2016) and other systems
    that require exchange of information between different MPC subsystems. Future
    research should focus on the robustness of model uncertainties and time delays.
    We should also develop MPC strategies with shorter computing times and higher
    robustness and, at the same time, expand their application areas beyond the industrial
    sector to agriculture. 2.3.3. Explicit MPC Explicit MPC uses table lookup to replace
    online optimization and reduces the MPC calculation time directly. By employing
    multiparameter quadratic programming, repetitive computation can be completed
    offline, which largely reduces the online calculation time (Alessio and Bemporad,
    2009). In general, low precision operations are the first choice to reduce costs,
    accelerate execution or reduce power consumption. However, constraint satisfaction
    cannot be guaranteed in low-precision operations. Suardi et al. designed an explicit
    MPC scheme to guarantee hard constraints with limited precision (Suardi et al.,
    2016). However, explicit MPC strategies are only suitable for small-scale optimization
    problems. The demands for high speed and real-time execution in complex, large-scale
    control systems are not always satisfied. In the future, semi-explicit methods
    (Goebel and Allgöwer, 2017) should also be studied to preprocess MPC optimization
    problems offline as much as possible. Over approximately 40 years of development,
    MPC has been able to solve multivariable constraints, robustness problems, and
    nonlinear problems and reduce computation times. In general, with a good theoretical
    basis and a proven ability to handle many industrial control problems, MPC is
    now considered an extremely powerful method. Moreover, the extension of the application
    of MPC schemes represents an important research field. The history of MPC development
    is briefly summarized in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (339KB) Download

    of MPC in agriculture Agricultural production objects and industrial control objects
    have many similarities, such as a large time delay, nonlinearity, and constraints.
    This chapter summarizes the current application of MPC in agriculture, such as
    in irrigation systems, agricultural machinery, agricultural production, product
    processing, and greenhouses. 3.1. Irrigation systems It is essential for plants
    to receive efficient and timely irrigation during growth. Currently, widely used
    control algorithms in irrigation systems involve PID control, robust control,
    optimal control, predictive control, and nonlinear control (Salahou, 2013). However,
    both PID control and robust control rely heavily on an exact description of the
    control pair, and an irrigation canal involves nonlinearity, a large time delay,
    and perturbation. Thus, it is very difficult to create exact models. Artificial
    intelligence control schemes such as MPC can avoid complicated mathematical modeling
    to some extent and can solve the nonlinear models and random disturbances associated
    with canals (Wu et al., 2008). Thus, MPC appears to be a promising irrigation
    control tool (Delgoda et al., 2016) whose purpose is to control the water level
    or flow by controlling locks, gates, and pumps. Therefore, the following section
    analyzes and explains the application of MPC in irrigation according to different
    controlled variables. 3.1.1. Flow regulation Puig et al. presented a method based
    on MPC for the optimal management of a combined irrigation and water supply system
    and proved the effectiveness of MPC (Puig et al., 2012). With respect to cotton
    irrigation feedback control, McCarthy et al. used a model-based irrigation strategy
    that generated a higher simulated yield and water efficiency (McCarthy et al.,
    2014). Aguilar et al. demonstrated that the performance of predictive control
    is superior to that of a harmonic proportional, integral and derivative controller
    in terms of the automatic management of water demand emissions (Aguilar et al.,
    2016). In addition, a hierarchical controller can be used to preserve a distillate
    volume for greenhouse irrigation (Roca et al., 2016). For large irrigation systems,
    a distributed MPC scheme is more suitable because it can save computing time.
    Negenborn et al. proposed a serial, iteration-based distributed MPC scheme (Negenborn
    et al., 2009a, Negenborn et al., 2009b) and a noniterative cascaded predictive
    control method to control irrigation canals. The authors found that the noniterative
    method performed better than the iterative method when the number of iterations
    was less than 30 (Negenborn et al., 2009a, Negenborn et al., 2009b). Although
    the amount of information associated with the iterative algorithms was higher
    than that associated with noniterative algorithms (Scattolini, 2009), a significant
    amount of time was required to complete the necessary number of iterations. 3.1.2.
    Water level regulation Zhang et al. proposed a noncooperative distributed MPC
    (NDMPC) method based on Nash optimality to devise a controller for setting point
    regulation and found this method to be efficient (Zhang et al., 2015). However,
    communication constraints and large disturbances from the environment should be
    considered in the future. For set points, a dynamic target trajectory method can
    calculate changes in the control targets used by MPC. This scheme is more robust
    and stable for controlling all water levels within the established bounds (Xu,
    2016). Sutrisno et al. proposed a weighting scheme in which each weighted value
    is proportional to the volume of the subsystem of the designed controller. The
    results show that the cost of Nash-bargaining MPC (NB-MPC) using the aforementioned
    weighting scheme is lowest (Sutrisno et al., 2012). Farhadi et al. proposed a
    distributed MPC scheme with a two-level architecture; results show that the secondary
    distribution MPC method exhibits high performance. The problem of identifying
    disjointed neighborhoods for a distributed system with arbitrary topology should
    be solved in the future (Farhadi and Khodabandehlou, 2016). Figueiredo et al.
    applied MPC to an automatic water canal managed by a supervisory control and data
    acquisition (SCADA) system (Figueiredo et al., 2013). Horváth et al. found that
    the gate may be better than the discharge for this canal because the method is
    able to consider the interaction between channel pools and better solve the steady-state
    offset (Horváth et al., 2014). For a steady-state offset, Horváth et al. developed
    and implemented an additional component, which was applied to MPC to eliminate
    the offset of a predictive controller for the water level. The method was shown
    to be effective (Horváth et al., 2015). Further studies are needed to confirm
    the performance of this method in other situations. 3.1.3. Flow and water level
    regulation Lemos et al. estimated the performance of adaptive and nonadaptive
    MPC using a pilot irrigation channel (Lemos et al., 2009). Kearney et al. developed
    a noniterative distributed MPC scheme that incorporates the concept of spare supply
    capacity (Kearney et al., 2011a, Kearney et al., 2011b). This method is more efficient
    than a centralized MPC method. Future studies could improve the spare supply capacity
    approximation and modify the proposed DMPC formulation to attain recursive feasibility.
    Álvarez et al. proposed cooperative distributed MPC. The results show that this
    controller is better than conventional decentralized MPC because of savings on
    resources and cost. More complex algorithms must be tested in actual irrigation
    systems (Álvarez et al., 2013). Regarding hierarchical methods, Fele et al. proposed
    a hierarchical distributed control scheme. The lower layer is controlled by a
    closed-loop MPC scheme (Fele et al., 2013). The authors also proposed a hierarchical
    control scheme. The bottom layer used a decentralized MPC scheme (Fele et al.,
    2014). In addition, Li developed a two-level hierarchical control whose higher
    level involves MPC (Li, 2014). From a risk perspective, Zafra-Cabeza et al. proposed
    a hierarchical distributed MPC (HDMPC) scheme. In the lower layer, the distributed
    MPC manipulates the flow and doors to reach the water level required for the top
    layer (Zafra-Cabeza et al., 2011a, Zafra-Cabeza, et al., 2011b). Sadowska et al.
    developed a hierarchical, event-driven controller with a coordinator that could
    modify set points (Sadowska et al., 2014a, Sadowska et al., 2014b). The authors
    also found that the performance of event-driven control was better than that of
    time-driven control (Sadowska et al., 2015, Sadowska, et al., 2015). The authors
    plan to examine real irrigation channels in future studies. A canal cannot effectively
    deliver water under severe inflow fluctuations (Han and Qiao, 2014). Researchers
    found that combining MPC with online water storage could compensate for an existing
    flow delay time and avoid large waves to improve performance (Hashemy et al.,
    2013, Shahdany et al., 2016). Others combined MPC and local operations with human
    involvement to produce mobile MPC (MoMPC) (Maestre et al., 2014). This method
    is more practical and better than either fully manual or fully automatic operations
    (Sadowska et al., 2015, Sadowska, et al., 2015). Kearney et al. presented an MPC
    scheme featuring a predetermined load to consider the constraints applied to a
    dynamical system (Kearney et al., 2011a, Kearney et al., 2011b). The authors also
    proposed varying water level references across time to improve transient performance
    (Kearney and Cantoni, 2012). Neshastehriz et al. proposed a robust MPC method
    that involves offline design of the nominal trajectory to calculate the demand
    forecast (Neshastehriz et al., 2014). In addition, MPC can be used for river flood
    control (Breckpot et al., 2013). In general, large, complex systems such as irrigation
    canals can be separated into several subsystems. To this end, decentralized control
    methods are commonly used, such as decentralized MPC, which are relatively simple
    and easy to handle. However, these methods are suitable for applying to subsystems
    of interactions under conditions that are not very strong. Centralized MPC may
    not be practical because of computational requirements or the ability to obtain
    a solution that includes all subsystems in a complex, large-scale system. In addition,
    this method is difficult to reconcile and maintain because the computations are
    complex and all subsystems must trust a central controller. Another approach is
    distributed MPC, in which local MPC controls the entire system and requires less
    computational power than centralized MPC. This allows for information exchange
    and closed-loop control, but the control accuracy is highly dependent on the communication
    and collaboration between local agents. Hierarchical MPC can quickly deliver water
    to users with only a small amount of communication. The higher level subsystems
    control the whole, and the variables are created by the subsystems at lower levels
    (Scattolini and Colaneri, 2007). The hierarchical and distributed MPCs can be
    used together to further optimize the operation of irrigation canals. The use
    of these technologies is essential for agricultural activities in arid and semiarid
    regions. Although the MPC schemes used in irrigation are diverse, most of them
    have rarely been tested in actual canals. Future research should focus on testing
    methods in actual large irrigation canals, the performance and parameter settings
    of different controllers at depth, and the robust and stochastic controllers used
    to resolve uncertainty in system dynamics. Table 2 shows the application of MPC
    schemes in irrigation systems. Table 2. Application of MPC schemes in an irrigation

    et al., 2015, Sadowska, et al., 2015 3.2. Agricultural machinery According to
    statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the
    world''s population will increase to 9.1 billion by 2050. To feed this growing
    people, more efficient and accurate agricultural production machines using automation
    are required. To ensure efficient agricultural machinery production, agricultural
    machinery navigation, path tracking and steering control are very important. 3.2.1.
    Navigation operation The purpose of agricultural autonomous navigation or guidance
    is to control the vehicle trajectory to maintain it a constant distance from the
    adjacent travel line or to place the strip side by side in accordance with agricultural
    conditions without overlapping or gaps. An autonomous tractor must maintain and
    follow a precise trajectory during tillage to avoid damage to crops or plants.
    In the cruise control system of a combine harvester, the relationship between
    the input signal and actual speed is nonlinear, but the relationship can be transformed
    into a time-varying linear model. Time-varying features and constraints require
    an online calculation control method. MPC is the best choice for this purpose.
    Coen et al. used constraint MPC with an alternative active set method (ASM) to
    achieve cruise control for a combine harvester (Coen et al., 2008). The computation
    time of the ASM is nearly 100 times less than that of the standard interior point
    method (IPM). Backman et al. used NMPC to complete a navigation task. At a speed
    of 12 km/h, sufficient accuracy is required for up to 10 cm of lateral error (Backman
    et al., 2012). Kraus et al. proposed a moving horizon estimation (MHE)-NMPC framework
    for autonomous tractor navigation. The average deviation from the time-based reference
    trajectory on slightly curved strips is 0.26 m, and the average deviation in headland
    turns on a wet and bumpy grass field is 0.60 m (Kraus et al., 2013). In addition
    to agricultural machine navigation, MPC can also be used for inland navigation
    (Horvath et al., 2014). 3.2.2. Path-tracking operation The tractor-trailer system
    can significantly improve the transport efficiency of an object. However, because
    of multiple complex bodies in the system, path-tracking control is very complicated.
    Kayacan et al. elaborated a rapidly distributed nonlinear MPC scheme integrated
    with nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE) for estimating the state and parameters
    (Kayacan et al., 2014). The authors also presented a centralized nonlinear MPC
    (CeNMPC) method with MHE (Kayacan et al., 2015a, Kayacan et al., 2015b, Kayacan
    et al., 2015c). However, because deploying the MIMO system is a time-consuming
    task, the centralized control method may be computationally infeasible. Thus,
    the decentralized MPC (DeMPC) method can be used as an alternative solution. Kayacan
    et al. also proposed a robust tube-based DeNMPC (decentralized NMPC)-NMHE method.
    The computational time of the method is less than 75% of the CeNMPC time (Kayacan,
    2015). The MPC could also be used to control the yaw dynamics of a tractor. The
    authors’ results showed that the Euclidean error of the time-based straight line
    trajectory is less than 40 cm, while the time-based curve trajectory is 60 cm
    (Kayacan et al., 2015a, Kayacan et al., 2015b, Kayacan et al., 2015c). Linear
    MPC (LMPC) was designed for the path-tracking error control of unmanned ground
    vehicles, and the results showed that the average Euclidian distance errors for
    the tractor and the trailer on straight lines were 23.49 and 21.21 cm, respectively,
    whereas those on curved lines were 39.82 and 36.21 cm. The calculation time of
    LMPC was approximately 1.1 ms, which was less than that of NMPC (Kayacan et al.,
    2015a, Kayacan et al., 2015b, Kayacan et al., 2015c). In the future, these designs
    can be extended to create a dynamic model. Yang et al. presented explicit MPC
    based on a multiparametric mixed-integer quadratic programming (mp-MIQP) technique
    that could reduce the tracking errors of a trailer and smooth the steering angle
    behavior of a tractor (Yang and Taehyun, 2012). Yakub et al. compared MPC and
    linear quadratic control (LQC) and fond that MPC showed better tracking performance
    than did LQC, especially in constrained multivariable systems (Yakub and Mori,
    2015). Plessen et al. proposed a linear time-varying MPC (LTV-MPC) method to generate
    offline reference trajectories for high-precision closed-loop tracking. The method
    can achieve millimeter-precision tracking (Plessen and Bemporad, 2017). Zhang
    et al. presented an RMPC method for automatic operation boats (AOBs) to deliver
    bait uniformly along desired paths. The maximum deviation errors in the turning
    points and the straight lines were 0.36 m and 0.09 m, respectively. This method
    performed better than did traditional fuzzy PD control. In the future, this scheme
    could be combined with neural network learning techniques (Zhang, et al., 2017a,
    Zhang et al., 2017b, Zhang et al., 2017c). In addition, path-following control
    with MPC could be used to design an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (Hernandez et
    al., 2015). In forests, MPC could also be applied for the path tracking of a hydraulic
    forestry crane (Kalmari et al., 2014, Kalmari et al., 2017). 3.2.3. Steering operation
    In general, operators must manually turn around at the end of each straight path
    and then reconnect the automatic guidance system to follow the next path. The
    automation of maneuvers in a headland can reduce the burden on drivers and improve
    efficiency. To this end, for a system driving forward, Cariou et al. proposed
    a kinematic model that uses additional sliding parameters and MPC methods. For
    a system running backward, the authors compared two different steering controllers.
    Promising results have suggested that an overall tracking error within ±20 cm
    is obtained during the maneuver (Cariou et al., 2010). Gao et al. proposed a DMC-PD
    cascade approach to control automatic steering. The results indicated that the
    absolute value of the steering angle tracking error was 0.5° and that the tracking
    delay was 0.25 s (Gao et al., 2014). Trajectory tracking is complex and important;
    the use of improved MPC or NMPC can reduce the tracking error and is a feasible
    way to accurately track a path. Distributed NMPC can reduce computation time.
    Future research should focus on improving tracking robustness and studying dynamic
    models. The abovementioned MPC framework can be extended by using dynamic models
    to improve control performance in the system’s transient response. For straight
    lines, the longitudinal velocity is constant, and only the traversing speed of
    the tractor is controlled; for curves, longitudinal velocity control can be improved
    to achieve better trajectory tracking. Exact turns are another key. However, at
    high speed, the steering deviation is large. Future research should focus on this
    problem. Table 3 shows the application of MPC schemes in agricultural machinery
    operations. Table 3. Application of MPC schemes in agricultural machinery operations.

    3.3. Agricultural production and product processing Agricultural products are
    the basis of our existence. This section describes agricultural production and
    product processing, which consist of aquatic production, livestock living environment
    regulation, food drying and biogas feeding. The purpose of MPC use in this area
    is to increase quality and yield. 3.3.1. Aquatic production Fish are renewable
    resources. However, as more people eat fish, the number of fish continues to drop
    dramatically. A recent review by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported
    that aquaculture has failed to fill the gap between supply and demand and lacks
    suitable management. MPC can be used to solve these problems. Bounkhel et al.
    proposed NMPC for establishing the best harvest efforts for renewable resource
    systems such as fish. This NMPC scheme determines the optimal control of the time
    interval. It is suggested that experiments be carried out on more complex models
    in the future, such as with the use of constant or dynamic discount factors (Bounkhel
    and Tadj, 2015). The price of aquatic products is an actual reflection of the
    supply and demand of those products, the reasonable forecast of which could not
    only maximize profits for enterprise but also provide a scientific basis for governmental
    decision making. Liu et al. developed a price model for aquatic products using
    the theory of predictive control; the model is defined by the pattern of supply
    and demand changes, and the authors discussed the influence of parameters on the
    dynamic characteristics and robustness of the model (Liu et al., 2012). 3.3.2.
    Livestock living environment regulation The efficient control of the indoor climate
    in a livestock stable not only saves on energy and costs and improves productivity
    but is also good for animal growth and helps reduce global warming. Typical modern
    stabilization systems are usually equipped with mixed ventilation; thus, modeling
    involves at least three key aspects: mechanical ventilation mode, natural ventilation
    mode, and a control strategy. Ventilation in a naturally ventilated dairy building
    clearly is always higher than required, leading to increased ammonia emissions.
    Shen et al. applied response surface methodology (RSM) to exploit a predictive
    model and used CFD tools to simulate naturally ventilated dairy buildings. This
    model can determine the ventilation rate under different wind and opening conditions
    and thus reduces the risk of high ammonia emissions (Shen et al., 2013). CFDs
    often result in models that are too complex and computationally harsh, whereas
    MPC can provide reasonable accuracy to reflect actual systems. Yang et al. found
    that the errors in optimal livestock indoor climate control models can be compensated
    for by using constraint MPC (Yang et al., 2009). However, there should be some
    trade-off between implementation costs and expected performance. Temperature and
    carbon dioxide are also important for the growth of chickens. Li et al. designed
    an MPC method for controlling the wind velocity, temperature, and CO2 concentration
    in coops. The method can predict the trends of each variable and is favorable
    for stabilizing wind velocity-temperature-gas control (Li et al., 2015). 3.3.3.
    Food drying Research on grain-drying controls began in the 1960s. Control was
    mainly achieved by traditional control techniques such as feedback and adaptive
    control methods. In the 1970s, with the development of computer technologies and
    artificial intelligence, intelligent control technologies such as the artificial
    neural network and fuzzy control were used. Since the 1980s, scholars have conducted
    MPC studies of the grain-drying process (Wang et al., 2008). Liu et al. proposed
    using principal component analysis (PCA) and neural network partial least squares
    (NNPLS) to design a process controller in the nonlinear MPC framework for maize
    drying (Liu et al., 2006). Han et al. established an MPC system based on a neural
    network and developed software to provide online measurement as well as automatic
    control of changes in grain parameters (Han et al., 2012). Zhang et al. established
    a drying MPC system that can detect grain temperature, hot-air temperature, and
    grain moisture parameters automatically (Zhang et al., 2013). Hernandez et al.
    designed a constrained nonlinear predictive controller to adjust the moisture
    content of fishmeal to acquire a stable final product (Hernandez et al., 2014).
    Zhou et al. presented a distributed parameter MPC (DP-MPC) scheme for forced air
    ventilation. This scheme decreased energy consumption by 15.5% compared with that
    under no ventilation control (Zhou et al., 2014). The deviation in temperature
    control was within 1 °C, and that in moisture content was within 1%. Automatic
    control of the grain-drying process can better ensure the quality of grain drying.
    In the future, we should focus on stability analysis of such control strategies
    during actual production. In addition, certain methods should be tested under
    actual processing conditions. 3.3.4. Biogas feeding Energy crops and other valuable
    resources are used to produce biogas by digesters. However, due to the high dimensionality
    and nonlinearity of the anaerobic digestion process, it is complex and challenging
    to predict the biogas yield of different substrate mixtures. Gaida et al. proposed
    an NMPC scheme to optimally control the substrate feed for agricultural biogas
    plants. The plant operator could gain 550 € per day compared with previous earnings
    (Gaida et al., 2012). This section focuses on the application of MPC in agricultural
    production and product processing. For aquatic products, MPC can predict and control
    the best harvesting efforts for fish, but future experiments should be conducted
    with more complex models. For livestock, MPC can effectively control the indoor
    climate, which is conducive to animal growth, and is more suitable than CFD. In
    the case of grain ventilation, MPC can effectively control grain water content
    and temperature while consuming less energy. For grain drying, MPC can reduce
    the water content of products and thus improve the germination rate. For high-volume,
    nonlinear biogas, MPC can effectively control the substrate feed of an agricultural
    biogas plant, which greatly increases revenue by reducing waste. In the future,
    these algorithms can be operated in practice. The application of MPC schemes in
    agricultural products and the processing of these products are shown in Table
    4. Table 4. Application of MPC schemes in agricultural products and the processing
    of these products. Applicable object Methods Improvements Control object Controller

    has gained increasing social and economic significance (El Ghoumari et al., 2005).
    However, because of strong coupling, high nonlinearity, the incorporation of MIMO
    systems and disturbances, this type of agriculture is very difficult to implement
    in practice (Hu et al., 2011). Traditional control theory cannot meet the needs
    of increasingly complex greenhouse control systems. As one of the leading methods
    in process control, MPC performs well in controlling greenhouse temperatures.
    Ghoumar et al. proposed a nonlinear constrained MPC method to control air temperature
    and compared it with the adaptive PID controller. The MPC scheme showed better
    performance (El Ghoumari et al., 2005). In the future, this scheme can be optimized
    based on economic criteria. Natural ventilation can regulate the temperature and
    humidity of a greenhouse. Gruber et al. presented a nonlinear MPC method and used
    natural ventilation to control greenhouse temperatures (Gruber et al., 2011).
    New variables could be considered in future. However, the nonlinear model is computationally
    intensive. Piñón et al. combined feedback linearization (FL) and standard linear
    MPC. The performances of the FL-MPC and NMPC methods were analogous, but the former
    decreased the computational load (Pinon et al., 2005). Blasco et al. proposed
    a model-based predictive control (MBPC) scheme to decrease energy and water consumption
    in a greenhouse, although costs could be reduced further in future studies (Blasco
    et al., 2007) GPC and DMC are also significant. Pawlowski et al. discussed issues
    concerning measurable disturbance rejection in GPC (Pawlowski et al., 2012a, Pawlowski
    et al., 2012b). Most control loops are realized as computer-based control systems
    and are controlled by a periodic sampling time. However, the sampling time could
    be aperiodic in an event-based strategy. Therefore, the authors also presented
    a GPC method that was combined with event-based sampling techniques. The main
    advantages of this combination are that it not only reduces the actuation load
    but also maintains the control system performance at an acceptable level (Pawlowski
    et al., 2012a, Pawlowski et al., 2012b). Xu et al. proposed an approach based
    on DMC whose overall performance is superior to that of PID control (Xu et al.,
    2013). However, the reaction time deficiency is long. Zhang et al. integrated
    DMC with PID control. The results show that the order of the optimal temperature
    control time in a greenhouse is as follows: DMC-PID < DMC < Smith control < integral-separation
    PID (Zhang and Chen, 2011). Ito established a temperature controller incorporating
    MPC for a greenhouse, and its performance was shown to be better than that of
    conventional PWM control (Ito, 2012). The controller features a temperature tracking
    error of fewer than 1.2°C at peak-to-peak values and less than 0.7 °C at the maximum
    values. González et al. presented a tube-based MPC framework for controlling a
    system with two-time-scale dynamics (González et al., 2014). Many other related
    methods studies have also addressed greenhouse temperature control (Ramdani et
    al., 2015, Ma et al., 2015, Coelho et al., 2005, Hu et al., 2011). Temperature
    and humidity are important greenhouse environmental parameters. Classical PID
    control and natural ventilation can control the temperature to some extent; however,
    the performance of MPC is better, and MPC can associate greenhouse temperature
    with window aperture, external temperature, external wind speed, soil surface
    temperature and external global solar radiation. However, more interferences,
    constraints, optimization algorithms and economic factors should be considered
    and tested in practice in the future. Table 5 shows the applications of MPC schemes
    for greenhouse control. Table 5. Application of MPC schemes for greenhouse control.

    quickly Zhang and Chen (2011) This chapter mainly discusses the current applications
    of MPC in agriculture. Today, MPC is mainly used in irrigation, agricultural machinery,
    agricultural products and processing, and greenhouse environments. The applications
    in agriculture are few, and many control schemes are only simulations, with few
    having been used under actual operating conditions. Moreover, the methods most
    often used are classical MPC and improved MPC or methods optimized for MPC. Some
    of the latest MPC technologies such as stochastic MPC, hybrid MPC, and explicit
    MPC have rarely been used in agriculture. In the future, MPC can be extended to
    agriculture applications to seek better optimization methods and incorporate more
    advanced MPC technology. 4. Challenges and future perspectives MPC cannot describe
    unstable systems and originally had difficulty recognizing online models, but
    it now reduces calculation time while maintaining high performance. The biggest
    challenge in the future may be the trade-off between computing time, performance
    level, and economic cost. It is very difficult to reduce calculation time and
    cost without affecting performance. In addition, for some complex algorithms,
    it is very difficult to guarantee stability and feasibility. Thus, some of those
    algorithms are likely to remain theoretical. Actual applications are complicated
    and difficult to achieve. Moreover, due to the complexity of real systems, more
    hardware, better optimization algorithms and the expansion of the control law
    of MIMO systems and nonlinear processes are very important. The application of
    MPC in agriculture is far less extensive than its application in industry. Large
    systems such as irrigation systems must reduce computation times and now incorporate
    distributed MPC and hierarchical MPC. In the future, the latest schemes, such
    as explicit MPC and stochastic MPC, could be used as well. For dynamic systems
    such as agricultural machinery systems, dynamic models can be researched in the
    future. The processing of agricultural products can be combined with more complex
    models, and greenhouse temperature control schemes should consider more interferences
    in the future. Overall, the state of MPC use in agriculture can be summarized
    in three respects. First, the application of MPC in agriculture is limited. MPC
    can be applied to more aspects of agriculture to improve efficiency and yield
    in the future. These applications include aquaponics, which is an efficient compound
    farming technology strongly reliant on precision regulation; pest and disease
    control; the fishing industry; fodder; and the seed industry. Second, some of
    the latest MPC technologies, such as stochastic MPC and hybrid MPC, can also be
    applied to areas of agriculture. Third, many control methods are still only simulations
    and are not in practice. Future research can focus on applying those methods to
    real scenarios. 5. Conclusions This review has briefly discussed the current development
    of MPC and its application in agriculture. Despite the many reviews of MPC and
    its development in industry, no summary of MPC use in agricultural applications
    has yet been published. In this article, we have roughly divided the development
    of MPC into three stages according to the different problems solved. Classical
    MPC mainly solves multivariable constraint control problems. However, this method
    is not suitable for nonlinear systems. To solve robust and nonlinear control problems,
    adaptive MPC, robust MPC and nonlinear MPC were established. Later, with increasing
    requirements pertaining to control performance and calculation time and to reduce
    computational time, distributed MPC, explicit MPC, hybrid MPC, tube-based MPC
    and stochastic MPC were introduced. These MPC methods reduce computation time
    by decentralizing large-scale problems, reducing computation time directly, or
    simplifying computational processes. In addition, we reviewed nearly a decade’s
    worth of MPC articles on agriculture applications. Since the MPC was established
    as an industrial process control algorithm, its application to agriculture has
    been very limited. According to the relevant articles we found, the applications
    of MPC in agriculture include but are not limited to irrigation systems, agricultural
    machinery, agricultural production and product processing and greenhouses. MPC
    applied to these agricultural aspects can yield significant productivity and efficiency
    benefits. Although distributed MPC, nonlinear MPC, robust MPC, DMC, and GPC are
    used in these applications, some of the latest MPC schemes, such as hybrid MPC,
    tube-based MPC, and stochastic MPC, are less frequently used. In addition, agricultural
    applications are very limited. There are many areas of agriculture that do not
    use MPC. Most of these studies are simply simulations with no testing under practical
    applications. Thus, there is much room for future applications of MPC in agriculture.

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: This paper deals with the development in
    agricultural activities like irrigation, soil temperature and moisture measurement
    using digital technologies and wireless sensors. Water is the heart of irrigation
    system and shortage of water is a growing issue for farmers. Water quantity needs
    to be checked for better productivity and sustainability of crops. Water regulation
    for different crops is different as insufficient or excessive water can be destructive
    for farming. An automatic wireless sensor based Irrigation Water Regulation support
    system is being developed. The proposed system estimates the water requirement
    for crops on the basis of soil moisture data gathered by several sensor nodes

    Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction Wireless technologies have
    been growing fast in recent years. These technologies are classified depending
    on the range of communication between sensor nodes. For shorter distances Infra
    red (IR) sensors based on light, point to multipoint communication Wireless Personal
    Area Network (WPAN), long distance communication GSM/GPRS/DTMF and Bluetooth,
    Zigbee can be used. This wireless sensor based system monitors the water requirement
    for a particular crop continuously and sends the feedback to the main system which
    controls the water flow [1]. This system is intelligent enough to send the signals
    on mobile of the farmer to control the irrigation time and water flow. Adequate
    water flow and irrigation not only maximize the efficiency and production but
    also saves the time and labour of farmers. The sensors developed for measurement
    of soil moisture can also measure temperature of the soil to solve the problems
    related to soil for a particular crop. The major challenge faced in dry and semidry
    areas of agricultural land is the water regulation for crops. Recent technologies
    are trying to benefit and solve these problems [2]. In some areas even water flow
    requirement is such a big issue that farmers are facing economical as well as
    sustainability issue. Sensors are used to improve the decision making capability
    of the system by sending feedback. Soil moisture sensor senses the environmental
    and soil conditions which can be sent back to the system for efficient performance.
    The systems developed so far in this context are wired based data loggers which
    are costly and have an installation issue in real time interface. This system
    measures information of soil moisture content stored in it and sends it to the
    main system with the help of microcontroller and other electronic devices [2].
    The research work of this paper is related to the development of agricultural
    activities like irrigation, soil temperature and moisture measurement using digital
    technologies and wireless sensors. An automatic wireless sensor i.e. soil moisture
    based Irrigation Water Regulation support system is being developed in this work.
    The proposed system estimates the water requirement for crops on the basis of
    soil moisture data gathered by several sensor nodes deployed in the field. The
    components and technology used in proposed system is explained in section 2. The
    section 3 illustrates the implementation of proposed system. At the last section
    4 and 5 covers the results and conclusion part. SECTION II. Components and Technology
    The proposed system is consisting of Microcontroller unit, Analog to Digital converter,
    Induction motor, Soil moisture sensor, Temperature sensors and DTMF receiver.
    A. Microcontroller Unit Microcontroller is a device used in place of processors
    where the requirement is limited and data rate required is a not big issue. The
    8051 microcontroller has been used as it is low cost, low power and high performance
    unit. It allows a feature of on chip flash programmable memory which makes it
    easier to be reprogrammed within the system. This also makes it easy to interface
    different sensors and input output devices with 8051. B. A to D Converter Analog
    to Digital converter is a device which is used to convert the output of the sensor
    which is analog in nature as microcontroller understands digital data. ADC0804
    is a converter which converts one analog signal into 8 bit digital output which
    is being sent to 8-bit microcontroller. This is a clock driven chip which decides
    the time required to convert the analog value into digital value. C. Induction
    Motor Induction motor is preferred over dc motor because it has low cost, ruggedness,
    smaller size and weight. Apart from the simple design it can operate in dusty
    and explosive environment because the brushes are not being used. Therefore there
    is no possibility of sparking which results in extremely reliable, low maintenance
    operability. Contactors along with relay card are used to switch on and off the
    motor. D. Soil Moisture Sensor Soil moisture sensor is a device which measures
    the water content of the soil. More is the water content in soil lesser is the
    water flow requirement. Some capacitance based sensors are developed in recent
    years which are also known as frequency domain sensors. Another sensor, the neutron
    moisture gauge, utilizes the moderator properties of water for neutrons [3], [4].
    Cheaper sensors are based on two electrodes measuring the resistance of the soil.
    Sometimes this simply consists of two bare (galvanized) wires, but there are also
    probes with wires embedded in gypsum. 1) Different Sensor Constructions a) Iron
    Nails Used as Probes ;The nails are rusted as a result of water present in the
    mixture. It also became difficult to maintain an appropriate distance between
    the heads of the nails given the small diameter of the pipe. The mixture of Plaster
    of Paris and water resulted in a brittle solid mass after drying because of an
    inappropriate amount of water in the mixture prepared. Fig. 1 represents the Sensor
    with iron nails probes. Fig. 1. Sensor with iron nails probes Show All b) Copper
    Electrodes Used as Probes Fig. 2 represent the Sensor with Copper probes. Copper
    probes corroded due the presence of oxygen in air to form a black coloured copper
    patina which gradually turned green with time. The black colour compound formed
    was copper oxide. 2Cu+ O 2 Copper+Oxygen ⟶2CuO ⟶ Copper Oxide (1) View Source
    Hence, the results consistently varied with time due to varying resistance of
    copper electrodes. Fig. 2. Sensor with copper probes Show All c) Aluminium Conductors
    Used as Probes Sensor with aluminium probes is shown in Fig. 3. The sensor was
    successfully constructed and calibrated. Fig. 3. Sensor with aluminium probes
    Show All E. Temperature Sensor (LM 35) Temperature sensors are devices which act
    as transducers to sense the temperature and convert it to voltage proportional
    to temperature in Celsius. LM35 is a sensor used in this system which has low
    output impedance, linear output, and precise inherent calibration which makes
    it easy to get it interfaced with ADC and Microcontroller 8051. F. MT8870 DTMF
    Receiver A receiver is used in this circuit to receive the data from different
    from 16 Dual Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF) tone pairs and convert the same into
    a 4-bit code which can be easily read by the microcontroller. This receiver is
    DTMF MT-8870 18 pin chip which has in built Differential amplifier with gain settings
    provided internally, clock generator with modifiable guard time and interface
    bus for communicating with external input output devices. It is a low cost receiver
    which uses 3.5 MHz crystal frequency oscillator. The DTMF receiver is easily compatible
    with MT8870/MT8870C-1 which is an advantage of using it. G. Dual Tone Multiple
    Frequency (DTMF) Technology Dual Tone Multiple Frequency is a chip which is widely
    used for analog communication in telephone lines to transmit and receive the data
    between transmitter, receiver handset and switching center. The push buttons on
    mobile provides twelve DTMF signals with different frequency combinations of low
    and high frequencies ranging from 697 Hz to 1477 Hz. Table 1 shows the frequencies
    used for each signal: Table 1. DTMF keypad frequencies The table 1 describes the
    frequencies corresponding to each button pressed every time. Every key pressed
    produces two different tones with different frequencies and produces a resultant
    frequency signal ranging between two selected frequencies. This resultant frequency
    signal is called Dual Tone Multiple Frequency. SECTION III. Mplementation of Proposed
    System A. Block Diagram and Circuit Explanation A Circuit is made which provides
    continuous DC power supply to the microcontroller as well as any other electronic
    device/IC being used in the entire circuit. 220V ac is converted to 24V ac by
    a step-down transformer [4], [5]. A diode bridge rectifier is used to convert
    24V ac to 24V dc and then the Voltage regulator (L7805) brings down the voltage
    to 5V DC. Temperature sensor along with ADC 0804 is interfaced with the microcontroller
    to measure the temperature and give the digital input to the microcontroller.
    LCD is also interfaced with the microcontroller and when the power supply is turned
    ON, the LCD illuminates and displays the room temperature at that time e.g. “TEMP:
    20C”. The block diagram of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 4. Soil moisture
    sensor measures the water content in the soil and its resistance varies accordingly
    and hence the output voltage too. The output of the soil moisture sensor is connected
    to a microcontroller pin. In dry state, the resistance of soil humidity sensor
    is approximately 1.7M ohms and in the wet state i.e. when moisture is present
    the resistance drops down to 0.7M ohm. The voltage across the sensor in the dry
    state (0% volumetric water content) is 1.9V and in the wet state is 0.1 V (50%
    volumetric water content). This voltage signal across the sensor is given to the
    microcontroller pin via an ADC 0804 and the microcontroller using this digital
    equivalent of the signal controls the duration of operation of the induction motor
    through the program fed into it. This induction motor is interfaced with the microcontroller
    via the relay card and the contactor which is connected to the motor starter.
    When the motor is turned on, “MOTOR ON” is displayed on the LCD and when the motor
    is OFF, the LCD displays “MOTOR OFF”. Fig. 4. Block diagram of system Show All
    B. Modeling of Sensorparameters The input parameter which is being sensed by sensor
    is moisture of the soil. The physical quantity (moisture) is being converted into
    electrical quantity (resistance) by the following two methods [6]. a) Volumetric
    Water Content Method Take a known volume of dry soil in a container. Add a known
    volume of water in it. Insert the sensor into the soil and note down its resistance.
    For each epoch, note down the parameters measured in the above steps. Repeat the
    above steps while increasing the amount of water added in Step 2. Calculate soil
    volumetric water content (in %) by the formula given in equation 2: Volume of
    water (in cc) ×100 Volume of Dry Soil (in cc) Volume of soil used=500 cc (2) View
    Source Table 2 Calibration table for volumetric water content method Fig. 5. Volumetric
    water content calibration graph Show All b) Mass percentage method Take a microwave
    safe container and note down its weight. Take some dry soil in a container and
    weigh the container. Insert the sensor into it and note down its resistance. Take
    a fresh sample of soil and add some water into the soil and note down the sensor
    resistance. Weigh the container after adding water. Heat the container in microwave
    for 5 minutes at 800W. Note down the weight of the container now. The difference
    in the weight of the container before and after gives the weight of water present
    in the container. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for different amounts of water added. Calculate
    mass percentage of water by equation 3: Weight of Water ×100 Weight of Dry Soil
    (3) View Source Where Weight of Dry Soil = Weight of (container + soil) after
    putting the container in microwave - Weight of the container Weight of Wet Soil
    = Weight of (container + soil) before putting the container in microwave - Weight
    of the container Weight of Water=Weight of Wet soil−Weight of dry soil. View Source
    Fig. 6. Mass percentage calibration graphs Show All Table 3 Calibration table
    for mass percentage method SECTION IV. Results After designing and implementing
    the proposed system, the following results were observed. Whenever moisture level
    of the soil goes down, it is sensed by the soil moisture sensor and the duration
    of motor operation is controlled depending upon the moisture content of the soil
    [7]. The calibration table gives an accurate estimate of the resistance of sensor
    pertaining to the different values of the volume of water in the mass percentage
    method and the volumetric water content method as well. Thus it possible to have
    a precise calculation of the weight of water from the weight of wet soil and the
    weight of dry soil. Also, the analysis for the mass percentage of water helps
    to have an adequate water regulation for crops and overcomes both the adverse
    conditions of exuberance and scarcity of water at different locations in a field.
    So we deduce that the incorporation of automation in the field of agriculture
    improves the reliability, sustainability and operability of the field. In controlling
    the moisture, the action taken by the microcontroller is tabulated in the table
    4. Testing results in table 4 may vary according the size of the field. It was
    observed that the proposed system led to remarkable savings in use of both water
    and electricity. This not only saves the money of the farmer but also protects
    the fertility of the soil as the proposed system reduces leaching of the soil
    to a great extent [8], [9]. The proposed system is being validated on commercial
    field located in Punjab, Landran. Table 4 Testing results SECTION V. Conclusion
    & Future Scope The proposed soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system
    is being developed using wireless sensors. The proposed system estimates the water
    requirement for crops on the basis of soil moisture data gathered by several sensor
    nodes deployed in the field. It is concluded that the proposed system led to remarkable
    savings in use of both water and electricity. The design can be further improved
    by attaching computer to the system as RS232 is given in the circuit. In case
    there''s an error in the system, the farmer can be informed by interfacing the
    system with DTMF Transceiver and hence place a call on the farmer''s mobile number.
    Also GSM module can be used to send a message to the farmer in case an error occurs.

    Precision Irrigation and Improving Surface Irrigation to Combat Water Scarcity
    Water scarcity is a critical issue for agriculture. In a world where agriculture
    must continue to compete for a water supply that is becoming scarcer, it is important
    now, more than ever, for agricultural water users to conserve water. Two methods
    of combating water scarcity are precision irrigation and improving surface irrigation.
    Of the the 25 papers in Sub-question 61.1, 9 addressed precision irrigation, 13
    addressed improving surface irrigation, and 3 addressed both. Adopting precision
    irrigation to combat water scarcity First, what exactly is precision irrigation?
    Before answering this question, let us take yet another step back and ask what
    is precision agriculture? Precision agriculture is an approach to farm management
    that uses information technology (IT) in an effort to provide the exact amount
    of water and nutrients to crops in order to maintain their optimum health and
    productivity (Rouse & Wigmore, 2017). Typically, precision agriculture uses satellite
    navigation, remote sensing and other technologies to farm while taking into account
    the variability in soils and crops. Precision agriculture relies on collecting
    and analysing large amounts of data to assess the conditions of the crops, soils
    and weather in real time. For example, sensors in the field can measure soil moisture
    content and temperature of the soil and air. Drones can be used to provide real-time
    images of crops. Information obtained from these remotely collected data can be
    analysed to determine when to apply the optimal amount of water, fertilizers and
    pesticides. The end goal is help the farmer avoid wasting resources while providing
    optimal crop yields and profits. In the past, precision agriculture was typically
    limited to large-scale farming operations that could afford the cost of the IT
    infrastructure and equipment needed. However, with advances in technology, and
    the development of drones and mobile apps, precision agriculture can be implemented
    in smaller farming operations. If precision agriculture is defined using large
    amounts of data to effectively manage a farm on the square metre level, precision
    irrigation can be thought of as collecting and using large amounts of data to
    precisely irrigate individual plants. The technology for precision irrigation
    can generally be classified in one of two ways: the equipment used to gather environmental,
    soils or weather data and the equipment used to automatically control the irrigation
    system itself. Although the term ‘precision irrigation’ is widely used, there
    is no commonly accepted definition of the term. To some, precision irrigation
    has come to mean drip irrigation. To others, it has come to mean irrigation scheduling
    based on data from local field sensors or other regional/global data. If drip
    irrigation is a subset of precision agriculture, it means that drip irrigation
    should apply variable amounts of water both spatially and temporally. However,
    a fixed drip irrigation system, once installed, cannot apply different amounts
    of water to different spatial locations, except according to the way the drip
    system was installed. Precision irrigation, according to the above definition,
    has only been applied to sprinkler irrigation where the flow rate from sprinkler
    nozzles can be controlled remotely. Methods for maintaining drip emitter flow
    include physical filtration, pH control (e.g. adding acid) and biological control
    (e.g. adding chlorine). These are standard practices that have been published
    and available for nearly 40 years. The papers presented for this question demonstrate
    that providing appropriate water quality for drip irrigation in a cost-effective
    manner is a continuing struggle for applying drip irrigation, particularly in
    remote areas. Accurate irrigation scheduling with refined estimates of evapotranspiration
    (ET) is also considered precision irrigation. Yet precision irrigation should
    consider both accurate irrigation scheduling to define the amount of water needed
    by the crop and accurate application of the required water (e.g. with both efficient
    and uniform application). General overview of the papers The submitted papers
    provide a nice balance of theoretical and field studies. Drip irrigation is practised
    on over 70 000 ha of land in Ukraine where it is important to maintain strict
    water quality standards to ensure trouble-free operation of drip irrigation systems.
    In the absence of strict water quality maintenance, system performance may decline
    drastically (Usaty & Usata, 2017). Drip irrigation has been found to develop spatial
    heterogeneity of soil properties, particularly under the perennial crops grown
    as a single crop for 15–25 years in Ukraine. Such heterogeneity interferes with
    the normal functioning of the system, as expected according to the design. It
    develops with increasing the load on the soils due to inadequate water quality
    and the effect of fertilizers having a local manifestation. The most negative
    process occurring in irrigated soil is alkalinization. The prevalence of sodium
    ions over calcium ions facilitates silt peptization, transformation and degradation
    of mineral and organic components of the soil (Usata & Ryabkov, 2017). Some researchers
    suggest that the pressurized irrigation pipe network must be flushed by chemicals
    with a pH of solution ranging from 2 to 3 at the appearance of sedimentation symptoms
    in the pipes that aggregate into agglomerates. Maintaining a negative water stability
    index due to acidification can slow down the processes of sedimentation and reduces
    the risk of formation of insoluble compounds. They concluded that preventive and
    remedial flushing was one of the most effective methods of maintaining an irrigation
    network at the project design level (Kupiedinova, Marchenko, & Tkachuk, 2017).
    The importance of organizing farming communities of small landholders and ensuring
    institutional support for them has been highlighted in a paper to ensure that
    the benefits of modernized irrigation reach this usually neglected and resource-poor
    group of farming communities. The authors contend that the centre pivot system,
    which is considered suitable for large farms, can be shared by multiple users
    of small landholder groups. Such systems have recently been established in Kenya,
    Rwanda and Ghana, and are likely in other areas in Africa (Fipps & Traore, 2017).
    The Rain Gun Sprinkler Irrigation System is claimed to be suitable for agriculture
    in limited water and drought conditions in the world. It is mostly suitable for
    irrigation of standing crops in danger due to extreme water stress or under drought
    conditions. Using this system, the soil can be brought to field capacity instantly.
    The Rain Gun Sprinkler Irrigation System is a cost-effective system among all
    kinds of system and is preferably provided in a movable or portable fashion (Dilipyewalekar,
    2017). A substandard quality of water has a vast range of values of the quality
    parameter, not all of which are equally harmful to the soil or to crops. In this
    regard, a decision support system (DSS) has been developed and presented for South
    Africa for the assessment of irrigation water quality based on site-specific characteristics,
    using internationally accepted cause–effect relationships. It is envisaged that
    the DSS will find wider application than just with South African users. Irrigated
    agriculture is the backbone of Central Asian economies and those of a large number
    of agrarian nations where efficient irrigation management is of crucial importance
    for sustainable crop production. A paper from Uzbekistan claims that ET-based
    irrigation scheduling has the potential to improve on-farm water-use efficiency.
    Results from a 2-yr study conducted on a cotton crop in Uzbekistan showed that
    there can be 25–34% saving of water without any significant change in yields when
    irrigation is applied using the ET-based scheduling method. This led to an overall
    increase in water productivity of 34–50%. The pilot plots are representative of
    38% of the irrigated area in the Fergana Valley (241 407 ha). If this methodology
    is widely adopted by water users’ associations (WUAs), large amounts of water
    can be saved, which can be diverted to horizontal expansion of irrigated agriculture,
    or for other purposes such as supporting ecosystem services (Mukhamedjanov & Mukhomedjanov,
    2017). Researchers spend considerable time and energy ensuring that the estimate
    of evapotranspiration by the FAO Penman–Monteith model under semi-arid conditions
    is reliable for use in irrigation planning over their target area. The model,
    however, requires an exhaustive database of a number of meteorological parameters.
    The relative contribution of a number of meteorological parameters used in estimating
    ET by the most adopted FAO Penman–Monteith model was evaluated for the Karaj region
    of Iran. The most important parameter was found to be maximum temperature, followed
    by wind speed and then by relative humidity. Working further, they proposed the
    following equations for ET estimation by the Penman–Monteith model: (1) (2) In
    the above two equations, ET0.FPM is the estimate of reference evapotranspiration
    by the Penman–Monteith model; tmax = maximum temperature, u2 = wind speed and
    Rmean = mean relative humidity (Kanani, Dehghanisanij, & Akhavan, 2017). Switching
    over from gravity-based surface irrigation to pressurized drip irrigation, taking
    in the benefit of the topography and helped by innovative leadership, was carried
    out in a minor command area in the Maharashtra state in India. The 0.5 Mm3 (million
    cubic metres) of water allocated from the Naghtana Reservoir by the government
    to a WUA is utilized for irrigation through a drip system, which has been made
    mandatory for all the members of the WUA. As a result, the earlier planned irrigation
    over 82 ha could be increased to 145 ha. The paper concludes with the remark that
    it is prudent to use naturally available potential energy at the source for conveying
    water from source to farm through a pipe network, and if sufficient residual head
    is available for operation, micro-irrigation with some location-specific modification
    can be promoted. In this way the saved water can be used to support high-value
    crops or additional areas for irrigation; simultaneously saved energy in the agricultural
    sector can be used in other sectors for national development (Bhalage & Sangle,
    2017). In the paper ‘Analysis of the technology for precision surface irrigation’,
    it is contended that surface irrigation performance is affected by many factors,
    such as land levelling precision, irrigation system layout, irrigation control
    rules and irrigation management. In this context, the real-time feedback control
    of precision surface irrigation is useful for monitoring the performance of irrigation
    as it progresses and for taking corrective measures where and when required (Bai,
    Xu, Li, Zhang, & Wu, 2017). The paper ‘Automatic control system for water-saving
    irrigation in paddy’ has as its focus that the flood irrigation system typically
    used in China has low water use efficiencies, aggravating the shortage of water.
    The paper presented the results of a study on a water-saving irrigation automatic
    control system. It showed that the control system can effectively control the
    irrigation of paddy fields while avoiding flooding during the rainy seasons (Hejing
    et al., 2017). In Argentina, 19% of the land is under cultivation, of which 7%
    is irrigated. It has been estimated that mean water use efficiency is about 30%
    due to gravity-based surface irrigation. The paper ‘Performance of surge flow
    irrigation in Mendoza, Argentina: present and potential efficiencies’, presented
    a field experiment and simulation models on surge flow irrigation for improving
    field irrigation efficiency. The results showed a wide gap between field-measured
    and potential efficiencies, which indicates that the irrigation equipment is underutilized
    (Romay, 2017). Improving surface irrigation to combat water scarcity Surface irrigation
    has the reputation of having low irrigation efficiencies (Clemmens, 1998). While
    it is true that surface irrigation performance is low in many parts of the world,
    it can also be quite high and rival the efficiency of pressurized systems. To
    achieve these high efficiencies, surface irrigation systems need to be appropriately
    designed and managed. For many poorly performing surface irrigation systems, low
    efficiency is due not to surface irrigation itself but to poor operating decisions.
    Thus, a good surface irrigation system requires simple operations that are less
    subject to irrigator error (Clemmens, 1998). This also highlights the need for
    irrigator training for operating surface irrigation systems. However, even well-performing
    surface irrigation systems have a time during the season when efficiency can be
    low, for example when the soil moisture deficit is smaller than normal (e.g. early
    in the season). Before continuing this discussion, it is important to note that
    irrigation efficiency is often confused with application efficiency or with fraction
    of irrigation water consumed (Clemmens, 1998). Burt et al. (1997) define irrigation
    efficiency as the volume of irrigation water beneficially used divided by the
    difference between the irrigation water applied and the change in storage. Thus,
    irrigation efficiency is really an after-the-fact determination of what happened
    to the applied irrigation water. Many people mistakenly believe that water that
    is not beneficially used is somehow lost and not available for reuse elsewhere.
    From a water supply standpoint, only water that is consumed or severely degraded
    in quality is not available for reuse (Clemmens, 1998). Most assessments of surface
    irrigation systems do not determine irrigation efficiency, since the data required
    are difficult to obtain (e.g. need to know the actual amount of water used by
    the crop or need to separate irrigation use from rainfall). Application efficiency
    is the performance of an irrigation event and reflects how well that irrigation
    satisfied the objective of irrigating. It is defined as the average depth of irrigation
    water contributing to the target divided by the average depth of irrigation water
    applied, where target means target depth of application, or soil moisture deficit
    (Clemmens, 1998). Some reported values of the irrigation efficiency of surface
    irrigation systems can be misleading because they often reflect the efficiency
    of a particular event and are based on assumed soil moisture deficit. Alternatively,
    reported irrigation efficiencies can be inflated if they do not consider distribution
    uniformity (Clemmens, 1998). It should be kept in mind that low irrigation efficiencies
    may not necessarily be bad. In some places, return flow from irrigation is reusable
    downstream and low efficiencies have little or no impact on available water supplies
    on a watershed basis. In other places, irrigation return flows are too saline
    or not recaptured. In those locations, improving irrigation efficiency has a very
    important role in increasing available water. Low irrigation efficiency may also
    be an economic choice as the capital investment to improve the irrigation system
    does not provide an adequate return (Clemmens, 1998). Even under conditions where
    surface irrigation has the potential for high performance, this potential is not
    achieved because of poor design or poor management of the irrigation system. Improved
    water management and control of flow can help modern surface irrigation systems
    achieve their potential (Clemmens, 1998). Use of farm reservoirs and wells can
    reduce the impact of a poor water delivery service. Improvements to land grading
    and shaping can also lead to improvements in surface irrigation systems. Land
    slope also plays an important role in the performance of a surface irrigation
    system. Typically, to improve the performance of an irrigation system, the flow
    off the field should be reduced or runoff recovery systems installed (Clemmens,
    2005). In water-scarcity conditions, it is recommended that the downstream end
    of the borders or furrows be closed in order to avoid mass losses in the irrigation
    system. Computer software packages can also be utilized to make recommendations
    to improve the performance of surface irrigation systems. A number of software
    programs have been developed over the last three decades. SIRMOD (Utah State University)
    and WinSRFR (United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service
    (USDA-ARS)) are two of the earlier versions. For example, the WinSRFR program
    is an integrated hydraulic analysis software package for surface irrigation systems
    that combines a simulation engine with tools for irrigation system evaluation,
    design and operational analysis. These and other programs continue to be developed
    and provide additional tools that can be useful for improving surface irrigation
    performance. Several papers in this session discuss progress in this area. Future
    developments of these software packages should be geared to incorporate the use
    of physically based infiltration equations in place of the Kostiakov-type relationships
    in the simulation engine tools while maintaining fast computational speeds. It
    is a fact that surface irrigation by gravity flow of water is the most common
    the world over. Of the surface irrigation methods, there are border, furrow and
    basin methods of land preparation, suitable for different crops. It is, however,
    recognized by all concerned that all methods of surface irrigation are wasteful
    in water use. Since freshwater resources are limited and the much feared climate
    change may cause great aberrations in the availability and time–space distribution
    of rainfall, which is the primary source of all fresh water on the earth, the
    renewed concern about the scientific use of available water resources and minimize
    its misuse is highly justified. Since agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater
    resources and must be sustained to enable feeding the ever-growing population
    of the world, scientific management of water in its agricultural use assumes great
    importance. General overview of the papers There is a paper on a modelling system
    called MSSI for surface irrigation design and management. In this system, two-dimensional
    shallow-water equations and one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations in networks
    with the Kostiakov empirical infiltration equation were applied to describe unsteady
    water flows in surface irrigation. Then the finite-volume approach with a fully
    implicit time scheme was applied to solve the governing equations and can accurately
    simulate unsteady water flows in basin, border, furrow and furrow-network irrigation.
    This is the central component of MSSI. The analysis can provide surface irrigation
    indicators such as irrigation efficiency and uniformity. Use of this two-dimensional
    basin irrigation and furrow-network irrigation methodology in Ye He Irrigation
    District, China, gave an irrigation efficiency Ea and irrigation uniformity Cu
    as 0.65 and 0.78, respectively. These two values meant low performance of this
    irrigation event. Thus, the basin surface slope, geometry, inflow discharge and
    inflow location can be reset until high performance indices were achieved (Shaohui
    et al., 2017a). Scarcity and uncertainty associated with water resources due to
    climate change are one of the biggest challenges facing agricultural water management.
    An effective measure can be to increase the efficiency of irrigation in agriculture.
    However, increasing surface irrigation efficiency affects water resource system
    indices, including its reliability and vulnerability in combating water scarcity.
    This was studied in the irrigation system in the Dez Basin in Iran where 4 billion
    m3 of water from the Dez Reservoir flows annually into the surface irrigation
    networks. However, the low network efficiency causes huge quantities of fresh
    water to be lost each year. The analysed scenarios consisted of combining two
    modes of changing consumption in the short and long term with management scenarios,
    including an increase of 5 and 15% efficiency of surface irrigation networks.
    In the process of simulating scenarios, the resources and uses of water in the
    Dez Basin were used in two horizons, namely short and long term. The system reliability
    in achieving the increased efficiencies was evaluated. Simultaneously with system
    reliability, system vulnerability also needs to be understood. The system vulnerability
    for the Dez Irrigation Network was greater in the long run (26% or higher). This
    means that the catchment area will be more vulnerable over time and this may be
    on account of climate change. It may be noted that system reliability is more
    human controlled, but vulnerability is dictated by natural phenomena (Zohrabi
    et al., 2017). The general objective of the irrigation improvement projects (IIPs)
    in Egypt was to improve the economic and social conditions of farmers through
    improvements in structural and management aspects by promoting efficient water
    use, reducing drainage problems and increasing agricultural production. These
    projects play significant roles in water saving and increasing productivity through
    physical improvements. The main weakness of the IIPs is the limitations of implementation
    of rehabilitation plans, main canal rehabilitation, drainage maintenance and implementation
    of cost-effective technologies. Therefore, implementing an IIP in a half-hearted
    way and without a complete package may not yield the desired results. The authors
    suggest continuous assessment of exact outcomes from the projects to identify
    the reasons for shortcomings and then act on them suitably (Sayed, Adel, El Hassan,
    & Watanabe, 2017). Studies on water-saving efficiency and water resource productivity
    of paddy rice in Taiwan established an irrigation managing strategy in a water-shortage
    period. Paddy rice planted on 16 February reached water-saving efficiency of 9.0–38.3%,
    compared with that planted on 16 January. On water resource productivity, the
    SRI (system of rice intensification) planted on 16 February was also the best.
    The paddy rice field irrigation managing strategy established from this research
    could effectively respond to climate change and the severe water shortage problem
    in spring in Taiwan. Further, it could advance the distribution and utility efficiency
    of irrigation water use in water-shortage periods. From the viewpoint of growing
    days and crop water requirement, the plant date of the first crop being adjusted
    from 16 January to 16 February, its growing days would change from 141 to 123,
    and the accumulated crop water requirement from 517 to 496 mm. Thus the paddy
    rice growing days, crop water requirement and field irrigation water have all
    shown a decreasing trend according to the adjustment of planting date. The field
    irrigation water decreases due to extension of the rotation irrigation interval.
    This finding could be applied to the establishment of irrigation scheduling of
    paddy rice. On water resource productivity, the SRI would achieve the best results
    (Chen, Lin, & Lee, 2017). In Mexico it is estimated that, in nearly 90% of the
    irrigated area, some variant of gravity irrigation (furrow or border, mainly)
    has been adopted, which have low application efficiency of 57% and are wasteful
    of water. Enhancing this efficiency would contribute to water sustainability.
    Most of the watersheds in Mexico are in an unsustainable situation in which demand
    grows continuously, as the population grows. To attend to this situation and work
    towards sustainable development, the National Water Program 2014–2018 envisages
    achieving water security and sustainability, based on management of this resource.
    The highest demand for water in Mexico is from the agricultural sector, where
    it is estimated that 77% of the volume extracted from surface and underground
    sources is used in irrigation. The main plot improvement method proposed for increasing
    application efficiency is land levelling, followed by proper irrigation recipes.
    The main supporting activity was monitoring of water use through measurement.
    The average increase in application efficiency was 6.38% and water saving was
    8.22%, when improvement actions were taken in the irrigated lands (Pérez-Nieto
    and Hernández-Saucedo, 2017; Castillo González et al., 2017). Faba beans have
    high nutritional value and are very popular in the diet of Egyptians. As a result
    of the limited cultivated area in Egypt and expansion in sugar beet cultivation
    to reduce the sugar production–consumption gap in Egypt, the cultivated area of
    faba bean was highly reduced. The results of the field study indicated that surface
    irrigation for faba bean resulted in very low water productivity (< 0.50 kg m−3).
    The productivity under drip irrigation was better, but less than 1.0 kg m−3. Changing
    the cultivation method to raised beds increased productivity and saved irrigation
    water, which could be used to irrigate new areas, but water productivity was still
    lower than 1.0 kg m−3. The highest water productivity can be attained with cultivation
    of faba bean on raised beds and intercropping it with other crops, where its water
    productivity increased to be higher than 1.0 kg m−3, having the potential to reach
    6.07 kg m−3 in Upper Egypt. Thus, it can be concluded that raised bed cultivation
    and intercropping faba bean systems can highly enhance faba bean water productivity
    and combat water scarcity (Zohry & Ouda, 2017). All over surface-irrigated regions
    in the world, adverse soil physical characteristics have been and continue to
    be inhibiting irrigation modernization and improvement programmes. This problem
    is specific to the shrinking and swelling of clay soils, which are difficult to
    handle either when too wet or too dry. Experiencing the non-maintainability of
    conventional lined canals over soft and shrinking–swelling clay soils over a 60
    000 ha irrigation area in the Waduk Kedung Ombo (WKO) irrigation systems in central
    Java, Indonesia, the option of prefabricated canal lining was taken up. This option
    has satisfactorily and permanently addressed the problem of canal disruption (Priandini
    & Maddi, 2017). A ‘small tank cascade system’ of water resource management is
    common in Sri Lanka, where it contributes nearly 195 000 million t of rice to
    national production (20% of national production). The natural drainage system
    in a watershed is blocked by earth bunds in suitable locations to store water,
    forming a series of tanks along the drainage system, distributed within a microcatchment
    of the dry zone. Such series are called village tank cascade systems. Traditionally,
    in the dry zone of Sri Lanka there is at least one tank in each village. The village
    community makes multiple uses of the tank water, such as for drinking, domestic
    uses, bathing, inland fishery and for cattle. Increased water storage also contributes
    towards maintaining the groundwater table (Perera, Jayatillake, & Wijayaratna,
    2017). In the next 30 years, the world''s population will increase to about 9.2
    billion, affecting water quality and also water availability, causing fierce competition
    for water among the different sectors. In the face of an increasing shortage of
    fresh water; partly due to climate change and partly to anthropogenic pressure,
    attention has focused on the possibility of utilizing waste water, mainly for
    agriculture. During the last century, agricultural water use increased 5 times
    and industrial water use 28 times. Of the pollution load from industry, about
    60–80% can be treated and the remainder will drain into the rivers without any
    treatment. Despite various attempts to manage irrigation water (the largest consumer
    of water) scientifically, the ground truth is that there is a long way to go before
    agricultural water is actually managed scientifically to minimize its losses,
    overuse and misuse. Incidentally, agriculture is also a noteworthy water-polluting
    activity because of competition to increase production by applying more fertilizer,
    more agro-chemicals and sometimes more water. It is also to be noted that the
    volume of waste water has also been increasing in leaps and bounds. Some waste
    waters are treatable to improve their quality for use in agriculture (mainly irrigation).
    Waste water treatment effect has been studied using bagasse fly ash layers of
    different thicknesses as filters. The efficiency of colour remover was 94% at
    effluent flow rates of 0.45 m3 day−1, with bagasse fly ash layer thickness of
    7 cm. The study, however, was restricted to only removal of colour of the waste
    water and did not show if other important parameters (BOD. COD, DO and salts including
    heavy metals) could be controlled through the use of bagasse fly ash in combination
    with a sand filter (Pongnam & Plermkamon, 2017). Currently in Mexico, only about
    half of waste water is treated for reuse. In an effort to increase the amount
    of treated waste water, it is important to enhance the knowledge of integrated
    management for using waste water in agriculture. To fulfil this objective, the
    Mexican Institute of Water Technology has published a book on waste water reuse
    in agriculture. This publication will be helpful for enhancing the technical capacities
    of the personnel responsible for water treatment and reuse (Cisneros Estrada,
    Saucedo, & García Rojas, 2017). Irrigation development and modernization in all
    countries have paid attention more to the constructional aspect rather than management
    for handling water. There has also been a lack of participation of stakeholders
    in irrigation system development. The goal should be not only to modernize irrigation
    systems but also development of institutions and human capital and effective collaboration
    among the stakeholder (community) (Sutiarso, Supadmo Arif, & Murtiningrum, 2017).
    Sub-Question 61.2. Using Ict, Remote Sensing, Control Systems and Modelling for
    Improved Performance of Irrigation Systems Water is critical for sustainable development,
    including environmental integrity and the alleviation of poverty and hunger, and
    is indispensable for human health and well-being. Imbalances between availability
    and demand, the degradation of groundwater and surface water quality, inter-sector
    competition, inter-region and international disputes, all centre on the question
    of how to cope with scarce water resources. Efficient water management has been
    identified as one of the priorities to ensure food security in many areas of the
    world. On the other hand, smart technologies are nowadays spreading into all sectors
    of human activity. Remote sensing, modelling, sensors, remote control systems,
    application of information and communication technology (ICT) are potential tools
    to improve the efficient use of water to achieve improved performance of irrigation
    systems,including geospatial and drones, etc., to improve management of soil,
    water and crops, and to predict and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather conditions
    of droughts and floods. By considering the importance of improving the performance
    of irrigation systems, the ICID, during the 23rd Congress, formulated Question
    61.2: ‘Using ICT, Remote Sensing, Control Systems and Modelling for Improved Performance
    of Irrigation Systems’ and invited papers for presentation. General overview of
    the papers on remote sensing Planning of water resource use for irrigation is
    often difficult due to insufficient and untrustworthy recorded data. Inaccuracies
    in data can only be identified by comparing their values with estimations from
    alternative methods, e.g. remote sensing. In a study, water supply was estimated
    based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and correlations built
    upon time series of official statistical data. Correlation between NDVI and the
    coefficient of irrigation water productivity (CIWP) allows estimation of irrigation
    efficiency, while the correlation between CIWP and total water supply enables
    further assessment of the latter. Correlations remain relevant with constant irrigation
    practices on arid lands where effective agriculture needs continuous irrigation.
    In the study, the NDVI index was used as the main spectral index for both irrigation
    area and water supply assessment (Danylenko, Mykhailov, Liutnitski, & Bohaienko,
    2017). A study focused on identification of agricultural drought characteristics
    and elaborated a monitoring method which could result in appropriate early warning
    of droughts. Based on remote sensing (RS) technology, an Agricultural Drought
    Monitoring and Yield Loss Forecasting Method can be used to identify possible
    intervention areas. With help of the method, the effect of drought on crops can
    be detected 4–6 weeks earlier than before and delineated more accurately, and
    its impact on agriculture can be diagnosed far in advance of harvest, which is
    the most vital need for global food security and trade. This information can reduce
    impacts if delivered to decision makers in a timely and appropriate format and
    if mitigation measures and preparedness plans are in place. Understanding the
    underlying causes of vulnerability is also an essential component of drought management
    because the ultimate goal is to reduce risk for a particular location and for
    a specific group of people or agricultural or economic sector (Nagy, Tamás, &
    János, 2017). Researchers believe that adoption of RS technology gives better
    estimates of irrigated area, salinized area and efficiency of the irrigation system.
    Also, adoption of this technology becomes essential for planning, design and operation
    of an irrigation system when the recorded data of ground truth are limited or
    unreliable (Vlasova, Shevchenko, Shatkovska, & Ryabtsev, 2017). Two remotely sensed
    vegetation indices, namely enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and NDVI, together
    with land surface temperature (LST) onboard a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) satellite, were used as indicators of vegetation health and vigour. Time
    series EVI and NDVI were analysed from 2000 to 2016 for the study area. Both EVI
    and NDVI are available in 250 m resolution, 23 data sets per year. LST are available
    in 1 km resolution every 8 days or 46 data sets per year. LST were resampled to
    250 m and aggregated to 23 data sets per year. Ten digital elevation models (DEMs)
    for the study area were acquired from an advanced space-borne thermal emission
    and reflection radiometer-global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) in 30 m
    resolution. An interview was conducted with the farmers in the irrigation district.
    Finally, it was concluded that EVI exhibited high sensitivity to detecting crop
    conditions, both healthy and stressful, in response to water availability (Herdianto,
    2017). Reliable estimation of crop coefficients is a prerequisite for scientific
    allocation and application of water to the cropland. Working on this notion, researchers
    emphasize that vegetation indices estimated from multispectral images play an
    important role in Kc estimation and consequently, the crops’ irrigation requirement.
    The object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification algorithm allowed differentiation
    of crop and soil characteristics, giving more accurate values of vegetation indices
    and crop monitoring. A linear model was used to estimate Kc as a function of NDVI.
    The r2 = 0.97 was higher than those reported when using satellite images due to
    the fact that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images have higher spatial resolution
    and better separation between crop, crop shadow, soil shadow and bare soil. Using
    Kc–NDVI models, maps can be generated showing the spatial variation of Kc (De
    Jesús Marcial-Pablo et al., 2017). A study on a 20-ha maize farm in Karaj, Iran,
    combined two indices of accumulated growth degree days (AGDD) and NDVI for modelling
    of maize phenology and determination of the onset of phenological stages. Considering
    the severe noise and 7 days interval in available multi-temporal images, it was
    necessary to use smoother methods. For this purpose and to achieve high-quality
    time series of NDVI, the real-time smoothing method of the weighted least squares
    (WLS) model was applied. The results of the combined model were compared by two
    frequently used methods based on AGDD and sowing-based models. The root mean square
    error (RMSE) using the combined model was the least for all the phenological stages
    (Ghahreman, Ghamghami, Irannejad, & Ghorbani, 2017). General overview of the papers
    on knowledge management Sutiarso et al. (2017) believe that there are five pillars
    of irrigation modernization in Indonesia: (i) water availability; (ii) irrigation
    infrastructure; (iii) irrigation management; (iv) institutional irrigation management;
    (v) human resource (knowledge management base). They have, however, chosen to
    dwell upon the knowledge management aspect. A case study paper based in Madhya
    Pradesh, India, indicates that the development of a web-based management information
    system (MIS) was a central tool in the process of a significant increase in irrigated
    area. The paper discusses the genesis and development of this tool under the World
    Bank-funded Madhya Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project (MPWSRP) and the
    measures adopted to facilitate its development and uptake by the department. The
    paper concludes that the availability of timely, accurate and transparent data
    is fundamental to the modern management of irrigation and drainage schemes (Burton
    & Stoutjesdijk, 2017). A paper based on a study on ‘Real-Time Feedback Control
    System for Improving Agricultural Water-Use Efficiency of Basin Irrigation’ discussed
    the real-time feedback control system of surface irrigation, including a real-time
    irrigation information acquisition and transmission module and a central controller.
    The proposed system has been applied in some irrigation districts and showed effective
    improvement of water-use efficiency (Wu, Xu, Bai, Li, & Li, 2017). The paper on
    intelligent measurement and monitoring of irrigation amount in well- irrigated
    areas presents real-time monitoring and control technology for irrigation wells,
    which consist of an ultrasonic flow meter, communication module and control terminals.
    The study was done in North China and the authors claim that individual farmers
    can use the technology through use of their prepaid smart cards. Management platforms
    at different levels, such as city, county, water station and village, can be set
    up to monitor irrigation water amount and distribution (Jing, Chongbao, & Hong,
    2017). Use of web-based information in planning, designing and monitoring of irrigation
    systems is termed ‘cloud computing’, essentially a DSS with a much broader scope.
    In order to solve the problem of inefficient use of water and fertilizer, a paper
    proposed an intelligent cloud irrigation system to manage the two resources in
    protected agriculture. The authors claim that the system is of great importance
    in guiding protected agricultural facilities to achieve high yield, high quality,
    ecology and safety in production. It improved water use efficiency by 25–40%,
    fertilizer use efficiency by 15–35%, shortened labour time and decreased the labour
    force sharply (Qinghong, Xinlan, Shuai, Hejing, & Qunchang, 2017). Information
    and communication technologies (ICTs) are an indispensable tool for improving
    the performance of irrigation systems. Their implementation requires an approach
    adapted to the needs of the actors, ensuring their optimal appropriation for the
    achievement of lasting results. The innovative methodology used to integrate ICTs
    into the PARIIS-SIIP program from the formulation phase, and the results obtained
    at this stage of development as well as recommendations for the successful implementation
    of the program were presented (Figuères, Onimus, & Ouédraogo, 2017). The researchers
    of a greenhouse experimental study on tomato presented a DSS that could be used
    to help greenhouse growers improve their current fertigation practice (Martinez-Ruiz,
    López-Cruz, Ruiz-García, Pineda-Pineda, & Prado-Hernandez, 2017). A paper from
    Indonesia mentions that irrigation management for its modernization requires effectiveness
    and efficiency in the operation of the irrigation network. Monitoring and remote
    control technology used in this research is the application of reporting of a
    website-based operation, measurement of volumetric discharge, and an electromechanically
    controlled water gate. Problems encountered in implementation were also discussed
    (Hidayah, Prihantoko, & Hutadjulu, 2017). A physical model along with a software
    program was used to evaluate the uniformity coefficient of centre pivot sprinkler
    irrigation systems in Iraq. The objective was to examine the improvement of the
    uniformity coefficient by changing the water supply from the pivot point to the
    middle of the main pipeline. Based on the result of this study, the author concluded
    that the software program can be used as a tool to predict the behaviour of the
    sprinkler system under different layouts and different operating pressures (Al-Katb,
    2017). In a study in China, the finite-volume approach and a fully coupled model
    for a canal–field system was developed to simulate unsteady flow simulation for
    a canal–field system in an irrigation district. Using the approach and the model,
    the water distribution and gate control in the experiment area was optimized.
    The optimized solution revealed that water consumption could be reduced by about
    21% compared to the present situation (Shaohui et al., 2017b). Three PI tuning
    methods for downstream water level control were used and three methods for tuning
    and designing PI controllers for downstream control were evaluated. The evaluation
    criteria were: effectiveness of tuning; and potential for practical application
    on an actual canal in the field. The analysis results of the methods and recommendations
    are presented. The paper examines three methods for tuning and designing PI controllers
    for downstream control: iterative, Ziegler Nichols and bump tuning. The methods
    are evaluated using three criteria: how easy each method is to understand and
    utilize; effectiveness of tuning; and potential for practical application on an
    actual canal in the field. The analysis results of the methods and recommendations
    are presented in the paper (Stringam, Wahlin, & Wahl, 2017). In a paper from Iran,
    the hydraulic behaviour of the canal and operational scenarios are simulated using
    the ICSS (irrigation canal system simulation) hydrodynamic model. The canal performance
    was evaluated using adequacy, efficiency and equity indices. The results show
    that application of managerial operations has improved the adequacy and efficiency
    indices by about 5–10% for all intakes, and the equity index has improved by 4%
    for the whole canal (Ostovari, Monem, & Hashemi Shahedani, 2017). A mathematical
    model study was carried out in southern Finland on groundwater table behaviour
    in a subsurface drained land using the three-dimensional (3-D) FLUSH model. Based
    on the study, the authors conclude that the effect of drain spacing had a more
    visible effect on groundwater table depth than on water balance components (Warsta
    et al., 2017). In addition to the above, there were two papers which were not
    directly linked to the theme of Question 61, but were indirectly linked to some
    of the issues related to the Question. Briefly, these papers are: folded plate
    technology. This paper from India on folded plate earth-retaining and bank-stabilizing
    structures provided useful and valuable information on structural/ constructional
    aspects of river training and management works (Dinkar & Panday, 2017); ecological
    water diversion. This paper from China analyses RS images to evaluate the practice
    of ecological emergency water diversion to Nansi Lake in China. The paper provides
    useful information of RS utilization for ecological purposes (Qu, Wang, Li, Hu,
    & Zhao, 2017). Sub-Question 61.3. Adaptability and Affordability of New Technologies
    Under Different Socio-Economic Scenarios New technologies in irrigation are continually
    being developed. Methods of applying irrigation water, determining crop water
    requirements, using low-quality water, providing drainage, improving water storage
    and delivery systems, forecasting droughts and floods and improving the knowledge
    of those involved in the storage, delivery and application of irrigation water
    are some of the areas where new technology is helping to improve the production
    of food throughout the world. Almost 25% of the world''s countries suffer from
    different levels of water stress. Access to newly generated technology in agriculture
    should be a human right more than an option for farmers, especially those with
    fewer economic assets. Since agriculture is the sector that uses the most water
    (around 69% worldwide), special emphasis is needed to increase irrigation water
    use efficiency which in some countries is very low (including conveyance, storage
    and application). The electromechanical efficiencies of pumping equipment should
    be taken into account when computing global efficiencies. The development of new
    irrigation-related technologies does not automatically result in better irrigation
    practices and thus more food production. New technologies must be put into use
    before they can be of value. Putting a new technology into use requires that it
    be adaptable, economically beneficial and acceptable to those who will use it.
    This may be a very difficult task when implementing some new technologies, and
    thus, testing and experiments are needed. Pilot demonstrations and extensions
    with continuous improvement for their adaptability and affordability under different
    natural and socio-economic scenarios are necessary. For example, something that
    may work very well in a small laboratory environment may not be feasible in the
    natural environment of an agricultural field. Also, something that works very
    well in the laboratory may not be accepted by those who would use it in the field
    because it is cumbersome or unfamiliar to them. The adaptability of new technology
    to various climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions is a significant
    factor in determining its validity. A new concept that provides a significant
    efficiency improvement in one geographical area or socio-economic setting may
    not be useful at all in another. For example, the computerization of a pivot sprinkler
    system will have little or no value in a part of the world where the farming takes
    place on hillside terraces or where farmers cannot afford computers or sprinkler
    systems. A modern efficient electric irrigation pump is of no value if there is
    no electricity available to drive the pump. Newly generated technology encompasses
    a process of transfer or training for users independent of their socio-economic
    level. Experience has shown that at the field level it is difficult to convince
    farmers to adopt any technology if it does not imply an economic return in the
    short run. Moreover, if the new technology requires a financial investment, farmers
    will think twice about its adoption, especially those farmers with low economic
    capacity, unless a special subsidy is provided to assist them. In this framework,
    the development of technology should take into account farmers’ needs from the
    social point of view and from the state of the natural resource (water) and the
    ecological points of view. The former should yield technology of easy application
    that is understandable and inexpensive and the latter should yield technology
    that does more with less water and has a small energy footprint. Within irrigation
    districts or water user organizations, the aim of new technologies should imply
    an increment in operational efficiency and in the way data are gathered to plan
    and operate better or improved irrigation systems. New technologies at the irrigation
    district or water user organization level could also include improved policies,
    processes and administration. Irrigation technology does not necessarily imply
    piping or canal lining, or high-tech or complicated equipment, or expensive ways
    of pumping or distributing water within fields. Rather, it should imply better
    water management through better practices. New technology for irrigation districts
    or water user organizations must also be applicable and affordable for varying
    conditions. It should be understood that there are different levels of technology
    needs and adoption according to the socio-economic level of farmers and water
    user organizations. One big mistake that governments have made is to try to increase
    the level of water efficiency of farmers and water user organizations from a very
    inefficient platform to the highest level of water use efficiency while neglecting
    the cultural, social and economic situation. The goal of increasing water use
    efficiency should proceed in a succession of steps towards achieving the desired
    level over time. Let us say that there are three categories of farmers in terms
    of water use efficiency: A, B and C, with A being the most efficient and C being
    the least. It is a mistake to try to move farmer C to level A in the short run.
    It will be more affordable and successful to move farmer C to level B and farmer
    B to level A. This procedure may cost time and money but will yield results that
    are more promising. Trying to move farmer C directly to level A will likely result
    in the farmer giving up on any improvements because they are beyond his or her
    physical, mental or economic capabilities to implement them. The situation dictates
    the level of technology that is needed. The land tenure and/or the land size of
    landowners (or land operators) are also important factors for the adaptation of
    new irrigation technologies, particularly in developing countries. For example,
    in China, it is difficult for traditional small household farmers to use drip
    irrigation because, to them, drip irrigation is not affordable and is complicated
    in management. However, in recent years many farmers have been transferring their
    lands by contracts to large-scale centralized land operators. As a result, drip
    irrigation and automatic control irrigation systems have developed quickly, as
    land operators can afford, manage and get benefit from the new irrigation technologies
    applied. It may be true that the small land scale and weak economic strength of
    farmers are major constraints for adaptation of new irrigation technologies in
    many developing countries, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation. However, it
    was also found that there is a simple, low-pressure drip irrigation technology
    (with elevated water tanks near the field to provide the low pressure needed)
    for small-scale farmers in India that reportedly worked well for small field plots.
    This, once again, shows the importance of ‘adaptability and affordability’ of
    new irrigation technologies. Introducing technology that is beyond the capabilities
    of the water users to implement will result in disaster. If farmers or water user
    organizations become frustrated trying to implement new technologies they will
    probable revert to the old methods they had been using and which they are comfortable
    with. This will often result in the abandonment of infrastructure or ideas that
    could eventually be used for more efficient use of water for agriculture. Farmers
    and water user organizations should participate in the decision-making process
    when any new technology is to be introduced. Here is where transfer of technology
    and training play a main role. The commitment of water user organizations participating
    in governmental programmes needs to include the training of their personnel and
    farmers to assure the success of the improvement plan. General overview of the
    papers The solar disinfection (SODIS) process uses the intense ultraviolet radiation
    from sunlight shining through a non-opaque container filled with non-potable water
    (grey water) to kill undesirable pathogens, rendering the water safe to drink.
    This method was used for irrigation of tomato seedlings and not for obtaining
    potable water. The authors describe a research project in this area in Brazil.
    However, no information on the adaptive potential or the affordability of the
    process is given (Aleman, Silva, & De Souza Pereira, 2017). Researchers in Brazil
    presented a greenhouse experiment for the determination of the weekly crop coefficient
    of tomato seedlings. The authors contend that often in practice, production systems
    do not operate under efficient management, not because of a lack of technology
    or capital, but because decisions are improvised, random, careless or subjective
    (Aleman & Bastos, 2017). Attributing the earlier misuse of irrigation systems
    in Ukraine as the reason for decline of the system, the authors of a paper have
    called for immediate action for their technical modernization, and of effective
    technical solutions as a prerequisite for sustainable development of irrigated
    farming. Though the Congress was a good place to discuss the adaptability and
    affordability of new technologies the authors did not pursue this (Romashchenko
    & Dekhtiar, 2017). A paper from China has presented some very good concepts on
    balancing needs, population growth, social knowledge, etc. Although the technology
    presented in the paper may not be new, its application is still valid. Moreover,
    various traditional forms of irrigation should be systematically researched not
    only for their engineering value, but also their sociological and ecological value
    (Yunpeng, Xuming, Ruoxi, Jun, & Jiangang, 2017). There has been a proposal to
    initiate a new groundwater management policy in Mexico. A paper in this regard
    discusses the need to allow users to have more of a voice in regulating groundwater
    extraction. Such a move would enhance the effectiveness of the new management
    policy (Casillas, González, Espinosa, González Bernal, & Bernabe, 2017). The authors
    of a paper discuss a study of two sample national irrigation systems that face
    water shortages and destructive floods during the dry and wet cropping seasons,
    respectively. The paper reflects on some of the shortcomings of earlier attempts
    to introduce new technology and discusses ways to make sure future new technology
    is adaptable and affordable. They feel that the basic approach to identification
    of appropriate irrigation modernization options includes: (i) critical analysis
    of the logical consistency of the design of the physical structure, system operation
    and water supply; (ii) assessment of the physical capacity of the irrigation structures
    to perform their functions; (iii) due consideration of social acceptability of
    selected irrigation technology and water users’ vision of the future modernized
    irrigation system; (iv) integration of effective local solutions to evident design
    shortcomings into the modernization plan (Delos Reyes & Schultz, 2017). The authors
    of a paper from Mexico feel that there are technologies available to overcome
    the adverse consequences of weather extremes and resource degradation but few
    will be able to pay for it. However, land improvement through drainage is considered
    an economic solution to the salinity problems in Mexico (Arias et al., 2017).
    The authors of a paper from Indonesia on the competitiveness of modular canal
    lining discuss replacing damaged canal linings with precast concrete sections
    and compare that with stone masonry linings. The authors indicate that users generally
    will easily accept and apply this technology because of the advantages in terms
    of strength, lifespan and maintenance costs. However, users have perceptions that
    stone masonry lining is better in terms of ease of construction, construction
    time and cost of construction (Sofiyuddin, Uzae, & Mulyadi, 2017). There are several
    papers presented under Sub-question 61.3 which are either not related or very
    remotely related to the theme of the Sub-question. One such paper on rainfall
    distribution and vegetation greenness from Natal, South Africa, claims that water
    storage for the present and future remains critical for economic and social development
    in South Africa. A paper from Taiwan deals with monitoring the safety of a dam
    structure. A paper from Mexico discusses the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure
    by removing sediment from the water conveyance network. A paper from Pakistan
    discusses groundwater conditions and its future, from the standpoint of its importance
    in agriculture. A paper, very distantly connected with irrigated agriculture,
    evaluates the effects and type of tourism in the Hsinchu City area using the ‘travel
    cost method’ of multi-criteria decision-making. A paper, better related to the
    theme (or water resources and irrigation) from Mexico, discusses the value and
    opportunities of using solar power to operate pumps for agricultural water. A
    paper proposes two tools for assessing the need for, and prioritizing the work
    to upgrade, small storage tanks in Sri Lanka. The author of a paper on a physical
    model study in Mexico discusses using a physical model to determine the flow through
    a tunnel. The data were then used to make recommendations for changes to the tunnel
    to improve the flow. The model work and results are commendable but cannot be
    clubbed together with other work, as this has been the only paper of its kind
    (Maponya & Mpandeli, 2017; Huang et al., 2017; Ramón & Nazario, 2017; Hassan et
    al., 2017; Chiueh and Liu, 2017; Robles Linares Gándara, 2017; Perera et al.,
    2017; Maldonado, 2017). Summary Question 61 had three Sub-questions, namely 61.1,
    61.2 and 61.3. The themes of the Sub-questions and the number of papers received
    under them are given below: Sub-question 61.1. Adopting precision irrigation and
    improving surface irrigation to combat water scarcity (25 papers); Sub-question
    61.2. Using ICT, remote sensing, control systems and modelling for improved performance
    of irrigation systems (22 papers); Sub-question 61.3. Adaptability and affordability
    of new technologies under different socio-economic scenarios (17 papers). In all
    the Sub-questions, there were a few papers that were not directly linked to the
    Sub-question theme. However, irrigation is a very broad subject and encompasses
    the entities of water, land and human resources. So linkages do exist, though
    they may not be clear. In this section, therefore, those weakly or indirectly
    linked papers are also included. Freshwater scarcity is of global concern and
    feared to be aggravated in the future. As expected, therefore, a number of researchers
    have addressed this issue. As water resources cannot be created in addition to
    what nature has provided, several authors have highlighted the efficient use of
    water resources to minimize undesirable and avoidable losses of water: in its
    storage, conveyance, application and use. Loss or wasted irrigation water is manifested
    in soil salinization, waterlogging, unworkable soil conditions, particularly in
    shrinking and swelling clay soils. Hence a set of papers across countries has
    addressed this issue. The water quality aspect has not escaped the researchers’
    attention. This is an important aspect and a management issue, as while on the
    one hand, fresh water cannot be created, poor-quality water always increases in
    quantity and deteriorates in quality due to anthropogenic activities of the ever-growing
    population. Since surface irrigation by the gravity flow of water over cropped
    land is the most common the world over, attention to improving surface irrigation
    efficiency is naturally expected. Also, such attention has been greater in water-scarce
    arid and semi-arid countries and regions. There are papers on the correct estimation
    of crop water requirements based on which type of irrigation water is applied
    in the field. Web information-based estimation (alternatively known as ‘cloud
    computing’), an advanced method of estimating real-time-based crop water requirements,
    has been used. A point of interest is that the topics of research and application
    that earlier used to be in the domain of research and educational institutions,
    have now also spread to executive departments. The case is similar with model
    studies, including physical and mathematical models. Real-time monitoring of irrigation
    and appropriate follow-up action have been applied in some irrigation districts
    and have shown effective improvement of water use efficiency. Similarly, intelligent
    measurement and monitoring of irrigation amounts in well-irrigated areas involve
    real-time monitoring and application of control technology for irrigation wells,
    which consist of an ultrasonic flow meter, communication module and control terminals.
    Obviously, such systems and methodologies improve irrigation performance. Further,
    even individual farmers can use the technology by using prepaid smart cards. Management
    platforms at different levels, such as city, county, water station and village,
    can be set up to monitor irrigation water amounts and distribution. Thus, the
    64 papers in Question 61 appear to have addressed all the relevant issues related
    to irrigated agriculture and some of the papers have even gone beyond them. Acknowledgments

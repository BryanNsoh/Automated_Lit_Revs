    Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies have revolutionized
    every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and the data driven services
    they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and
    influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc.
    In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this
    technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people
    from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways,
    from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying
    drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use
    of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity
    threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks
    have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent
    on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy
    in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture
    relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy
    issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more,
    the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research
    challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity Research and Challenges

    and Motivation According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected
    to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    cities have brought a variety of benefits aiming to revolutionise people’s lives.
    Those include but are not limited to, increasing economic efficiency, reducing
    cost and decreasing environmental output. However, the smart city itself is still
    in its infancy. As it heavily relies on technologies, it opens up doors to cyber
    attackers and criminals, which can lead to significant losses. An outstanding
    problem concerns the social and organisational aspects of smart cities security
    resulting from competing interests of different parties, high levels of interdependence,
    and social and political complexity. Our review shows that current standards and
    guidelines have not clearly defined roles and responsibilities of different parties.
    A common understanding of key security requirements is not shared between different
    parties. This research assessed the smart cities and their cyber security measures,
    with a particular focus on technical standards and the regulatory framework. It
    comprehensively reviewed 93 security standards and guidance. It then performed
    a comparative case study of Barcelona, Singapore and London smart cities on their
    governance models, security measures, technical standards and third party management.
    Based on the review and the case study, this research concluded on a recommended
    framework encompassing technical standards, governance input, regulatory framework
    and compliance assurance to ensure that security is observed at all layers of
    the smart cities. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Smart

    1. Introduction More than half of the world’s population is currently living in
    cities. This has meant that urban development has had to adapt to the population
    demands; however, frequently this has happened inadequately. The stress on the
    aging cities’ infrastructure combined with excessive population has created a
    number of significant problems. Chourabi et al. identifies two key types of problems
    that current cities are experiencing (Chourabi et al., 2012). The first problem
    concerns physical and material aspects of the city, which encompasses waste management,
    scarcity of resources, pollution, human health, and traffic congestions. The second
    problem concerns social and organisational issues, which affect the current cities
    - multiple and diverse stakeholders, high levels of interdependence, competing
    objectives and values, and social and political complexity. However, current research
    has placed an imbalanced focus on the former than the latter. Large amount of
    research has been done about smart cities physical issues and how the new technologies
    can facilitate them (Borja, 2007, Kabalci, 2015, Marceau, 2008, Toppeta, 2010).
    These benefits have been seconded by smart city examples of Barcelona (smart lighting,
    transport, waste management), Stockholm (smart waste management system), Manchester
    (real time water monitoring solution) and other cities. However, there is less
    research work about the social and organisational aspects. An outstanding problem
    concerns the social and organisational aspects of smart cities security resulting
    from competing interests of different parties, high levels of interdependence,
    and social and political complexity. Existing work shows that current standards
    and guidelines have not clearly defined roles and responsibilities of different
    parties (Kennedy, 2016). A common understanding of key security requirements is
    not shared between different parties. There are some exiting work exploring the
    complexity of knowledge sharing, governing shared resources and addressing shared
    goals within network organisations (Dawes, Cresswell, Commentators, Bingham, Caudle,
    2012, Weber, Khademian, 2008), it is yet to be appropriately transposed to fit
    the smart city ecosystem, in particular within the cyber security context. This
    research fills in this gap by analysing cyber security challenges of smart cities
    with particular focus on the smart city ecosystem risks, technical and security
    standards related to smart cities, and security regulatory framework. In order
    to validate our findings, this research also performs a comparative case study
    of Barcelona, Singapore and London smart cities and assesses their governance
    models applied, security measures implemented, security standards used and third
    party approaches adopted. This research finally proposes an appropriate framework
    to ensure that cyber security is embedded across all layers of the smart city
    ecosystem whilst preserving the innovative nature of the technology at hand. This
    research makes the following contributions: • Reviews and analyses a full list
    of 93 currently available technical and security standards relevant to smart cities
    and identified the security elements covered in relation to smart cities. • Performs
    a comparative case study of Barcelona, Singapore and London smart cities on their
    governance models, security measures, technical and security standards and third
    party management. • Proposes a smart city security framework to ensure that cyber
    security is embedded across all layers of the smart city ecosystem. The article
    is set out as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work of smart cities,
    smart city ecosystem, and the key security concerns; Section 3 reviews and analyses
    a full list of 93 currently available technical and security standards related
    to smart cities and the regulatory framework currently in place and their defeciencies
    and gaps; Section 4 reviews and assesses the smart cities using case studies of
    Barcelona, Singapore and London; Section 5 consists of discussion and a recommended
    framework for smart city development to ensure that cyber security is embedded
    by design; and Section 6 summarises conclusions and future work. 2. Related work
    2.1. Smart city ecosystem and risks The term of smart city has been used freely
    and encapsulates a number of varying definitions (Chourabi et al., 2012). Some
    definitions focus on collective intelligence (Harrison et al., 2010), some on
    sustainability (Toppeta, 2010) and others on smart computing technologies (Washburn
    et al., 2010). In this paper, the Washburn and Sindhu definition will be adopted,
    which reads: “The use of Smart Computing technologies to make the critical infrastructure
    components and services of a city-which include city administration, education,
    healthcare, public safety, real estate, transportation, and utilities - more intelligent,
    interconnected, and efficient” (Washburn et al., 2010). The smart city is a large
    infrastructure with a number of key and non-key actors. The complexity arises
    from the city being a public entity, however placing significant reliance and
    integration on private companies and end users. The complexity of the ICT supply
    chain has also been recognised by Lu et al. (2013). It includes suppliers, buyers,
    manufacturers, warehouse and transportation managers, wholesalers, retailers and
    customers. A disruption at any one side can mean tremendous consequences for the
    whole ecosystem (Lu et al., 2013). Fig. 1 illustrates how intertwined the ecosystem
    of a smart city is. It highlights the high number of different stakeholders and
    in turn additional security risks. Kennedy has noted that many traditional organisations
    suffer security incidents stemming from inadequately managed third party or supplier
    risk (Kennedy, 2016). Moreover, the third party risk is increasing due to Internet
    of Things (IoT) and Cloud prevalence as noted by Ponemon Institute report Institute
    P., 2016a, Institute P., 2016b. It is frequent that access to critical organisation
    assets and information is given to third parties with little or no security review
    prior Kennedy (2016). The reason for such an approach within traditional companies
    is to speed up the delivery of service and facilitate integration and interoperability.
    These are the foundational features of a successful smart city and IoT, however
    if not done right could also lead to being the foundational security weaknesses.

    Fig. 1. The ecosystem of a smart city. However, the real difficulty for securing
    the wider smart city ecosystem stems from fourth and fifth parties’ involvement
    in the ecosystem. These include the companies producing end-user devices, which
    are then directly plugged into the ecosystem by the consumer. The management of
    the smart city is powerless against these security risks and have to purely rely
    on their own defences and take on full responsibility if a breach takes place.
    Unfortunately, even though the cyber attack or data breach may originate from
    the third party, the primary organisation is responsible and pays the price. Whilst
    the liability can often be managed contractually, the responsibility and reputational
    damage will fall on the parent organisation. This can be illustrated by the Target
    incident where a breach originating from its third party vendor lead to $162 million
    loss, excluding the cost of legal fees and other mitigating measures (Magazine,
    2017). Another example of third party failure is Stuxnet worm penetration of the
    Siemens industrial control systems for nuclear power plants in Iran. Similarly,
    the airliner Boeing 787 was grounded across the world due to failure of the batteries,
    which were produced in Japan (Sarlioglu and Morris, 2015). Whilst the examples
    may not be directly applicable to the IoT or the smart city, the risks and principles
    of organisational responsibility are still valid. It reiterates the difficulty
    of security risk management in a highly complex organisation such as a smart city
    due to the number of actors and stakeholders involved. Public-Private Partnerships
    (PPP) has been used for the smart city management to transfer and clearly define
    the responsibility if the risk is materialised. However, there are a number of
    disadvantages that are noted against the PPP, primarily a potential rise in cost
    for the consumers to ensure sustainability. Further, they require careful consideration
    during the contract drafting to ensure the full benefits for the city (Medda et
    al., 2013). The rhetoric of a ‘private city’, ‘corporate smart city’ has been
    used by academia to note the potential drawbacks of the private involvement in
    public services (Hollands, 2008). These include neglecting public and citizen
    needs and requirements, limited level of involvement and a profit-above-all approach
    (Hollands, 2008). 2.2. Security of smart cities The key enabling technologies
    for smart cities are smart computing technology citehollands2008will, IoT (Li
    et al., 2018) and wireless identification, sensing, localisation and connectivity
    (Ma, 2014). The IT infrastructure for the smart city consists of fibre-optic channels,
    wireless networks and hotspots and other information systems, which are the traditional
    elements of the IT system. Explicitly to the smart city, the infrastructure includes
    sensors, end point devices and allows for user devices to be connected to the
    outer layers of the infrastructure. Whilst technology is the key component, it
    also introduces a number of security risks. The possible impacts on the affected
    city can be but are not limited to: power outage resulting in loss of economic
    activity, water pollution due to an attack on a water treatment facility, traffic
    incidents; financial loss, loss of sensitive information and even endangering
    of life through building control system manipulation. Li et al. has recognised
    that the key weak link for smart cities is the security and trustworthiness of
    data (Li et al., 2018). The trustworthiness of data is fundamental to a successful
    operation of the smart city; however a potential cyber attack could alter or generate
    misleading data (Li et al., 2018). As a result, falsified reports on smart grid
    or traffic could lead to inappropriate controls to the systems. This could have
    far reaching and even life-threatening implications, such as car accidents or
    inappropriate water treatment. Additional security challenges that IoT is facing
    are vulnerable and error-prone transmission mediums, which rely on radio frequency,
    and an ever-changing network topology (Li et al., 2018). Whilst Li et al. (2018)
    recognises the appropriate technical difficulty in ensuring the security, the
    author did not acknowledge the stakeholder complexity and difficulties within
    the supply chain, third parties and other involved actors. As different products
    and services will be governed and produced by different manufacturers, ensuring
    appropriate level of security across all layers may prove difficult. This is due
    to competing interests and different operational approaches to security and risks
    that supply chain and stakeholders have. However, the data is not the only security
    concern for smart cities. According to a study conducted by International Data
    Corporation, 212 billion “things” will be installed based on IoT technology with
    an estimated market value of $8.9 trillion in 2020, which translates to 212 billion
    potential attack doors (Dignan, 2013). IoT devices can be compromised in a number
    of ways e.g. connected into a botnet, made inoperable by a worm or used to penetrate
    the inner networks and systems. This has been evidenced by one of the key cyber
    attacks in 2016, where IoT appliances were connected into a botnet sending DDoS
    attacks (Agency, 2016). This threat derives from the internet connectivity, which
    allows for a remote attack and code execution. The threat is amplified by the
    inherent accessibility of technology used such as TCP/IP or Zigbee protocols.
    Information on the protocols’ vulnerabilities and attack tools are easily accessible
    via a basic search browser. As TCP relies on a unique user’s IP address, an attacker
    may easily trace to specific individuals (Pishva, 2017). In addition to the inherent
    vulnerabilities of various protocols, the devices are commonly deployed with little
    security measures and default generic passwords. The information concerning connected
    to the Internet devices is accessible using the Shodan search engine. The National
    Crime Agency (NCA) has highlighted that this security problem concerns a number
    of manufacturers and IoT appliances (Agency, 2016). Specific examples include
    botnets such as Mirai targeting insecure IoT devices and connecting them to a
    botnet (Wired.com., 2017); Persirai, connecting internet protocol cameras (Masters,
    2017); and Brickerbot, a worm rendering insecure IoT devices unusable (Biggs,
    2017). As a result, a number of IoT devices get consistently recalled (Agency,
    2016). The above analysis evidences the significant amount of threats that the
    city may experience. Unsurprisingly, the attacks do not require sophisticated
    skill to cause significant damage. Fig. 2 provides an illustration and an overview
    of threats to smart city. Download : Download high-res image (533KB) Download

    to adequately quantify the impact of cyber threats on public city infrastructure
    due to lack of real-time data. However, in 2015 a cyber incident on a Ukrainian
    energy distribution companies showcased the disruption and the impact that attacks
    on smart city infrastructure may bring (Agency, 2016). It draws an appropriate
    perspective on the damage that can be caused economically and to the citizens
    themselves. As a result of a cyber attack on the company’s network and industrial
    control systems (ICS), approximately 225000 people have lost electricity and companies
    lost automated control of their systems (Agency, 2016). Due to a critical impact
    of cyber attacks on smart cities and their probable likelihood caused by a high
    number of end-point devices, the security of smart cities must be at the forefront
    of a smart city strategy. The vast evidence reviewed above suggests that the threats
    to a smart city are extremely common and can lead to a significant damage. Also
    untargeted attacks, which are not designated primarily against smart cities may
    pose nonetheless a significant risk in the sense of collateral damage, if they
    exploit vulnerabilities in core technology building blocks or platforms. This
    was shown in 2017 through the NotPetya destructive ransomware outbreak, that although
    designated mainly against specific systems in the Ukraine, spread globally and
    affected e.g. the transportation and logistics sector heavily, creating harsher
    supply conditions problems especially in cities. Therefore, the key question is
    to ensure that security by design is embedded across all layers of the ecosystem,
    including private companies, the supply chain, as well as the lifecycle of smart
    city elements which may range from months to decades. This requires appropriate
    industry standards and regulations. The current framework of standards and regulation
    will be discussed in the next section. 3. Review of smart city related standards
    and regulatory framework 3.1. Smart city related standards The section above has
    highlighted the issue that the smart cities require effective technical and security
    standards. This view has also been seconded by the British Standards Institution
    (BSI) report on smart city data, which highlighted that smart cities across the
    world are dealing with different problems and require standards/data to facilitate
    the decision making (Institution, 2015). We have reviewed a full list of 93 currently
    available IoT and security standards (See Appendix A). The evaluation exercise
    has found a number of standards, which have been defined by industry and standard
    bodies, technology companies, researchers and cities. Among the 93 standards,
    13 out of 93 cover cyber security elements, listed in Table 1. We found that one
    out of 93 is currently being developed to address security and privacy of wireless
    consumer devices (Association). A high number of technical standards are pre-existent
    and apply to the infrastructure technology of smart cities. Standards are tailored
    and address either a specific industry or specific component of infrastructure.
    British Standards Institution (BSI) is leading the development of smart city standards
    in the UK. To date it has developed eight standards/guidelines. We noted that
    all standards facilitate the development and conceptualisation of smart cities
    and their strategy, but offer little guidance on security of the infrastructure.

    subsystems, and individual electrical and electronic equipment. This standard
    addresses equipment for security-related detection, surveillance, access control,
    communication, data acquisition, and threat assessment Standards.ieee.org. (2013a).
    IEEE C37.240-2014 IEEE Standard Cybersecurity Requirements for Substation Automation,
    Protection, and Control Systems The standards presents a balanced approach to
    security of automation, protection and controls systems (Standards.ieee.org.,
    2017) IEEE 1686-2013 IEEE Standard for Intelligent Electronic Devices Cyber Security
    Capabilities The functions and features to be provided in intelligent electronic
    devices (IEDs) to accommodate critical infrastructure protection programs are
    defined in this standard. Security regarding the access, operation, configuration,
    firmware revision and data retrieval from an IED are addressed. Communications
    for the purpose of power system protection (teleprotection) are not addressed
    in this standard Standards.ieee.org. (2013b). IEEE is a major player in defining
    technical and security elements for the IoT. A number of standards had been defined
    prior the term IoT or smart city was even coined. In addition to pre-existent
    standards, IEEE is leading the project IEEE P2413 - Standard for an Architectural
    Framework for the Internet of Things (IoT), with a sub-group focused on end-to-end
    approach to ensuring protection, security, privacy and safety of IoT technology
    (Cherry, 2017). In addition, IEEE has taken steps to standardize physical and
    medium access control layers, wireless networks and wireless devices with end-to-end
    security in mind. There is a strong input of standards derives from Europe (DIN,
    NEN, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI). The leaders within the technical standards are ISO and
    IEC. American input is mainly via ANSI and IEEE standards. Russia has developed
    some standards and they are mainly released via GOST R (London, 2017). A number
    of standards are tailored to specific industries. For example, NERC-CIP was developed
    for electric utility industry; NIST Cybersecurity framework was developed for
    financial, energy, healthcare and other systems (Grau, 2016). As the findings
    above suggest, there are a number of technical standards developed or currently
    in development globally for IoT technology and industries. Yet, despite the numerous
    attempts coming from different bodies to provide clarity and standardize the model,
    the smart city remains an ambiguous playground (Anthopoulos, 2017). The review
    also showed that the standards are not comprehensive and often focused on very
    specific technical features. Whilst 13 standards cover security to some extent,
    few offer a comprehensive set of principles to ensure security by design. The
    standards have not yet been adopted by the industry and have not been noted as
    mandatory requirements. Application of these standards will be further assessed
    by the case studies in Section 4. Lack of adaptation and poor security can be
    further illustrated by a study conducted by HP of 10 IoT devices in use today
    for security vulnerabilities. The study found that on average a device had 25
    vulnerabilities, totalling 250 vulnerabilities across 10 IoT devices (Miessler,
    2014). The study has initiated and contributed to the OWASP Internet of Things
    (IoT) Project (owasp.org., 2017). UK has released guidance on key security principles
    for connected and automated vehicles for manufacturers to ensure the security
    by design for smart transportation in the UK and a security characteristic for
    smart metering and communications hub (Group, 2017, Hammond, 2016). Automated
    vehicle guidelines are so far the most comprehensive and prescriptive approach
    to security-in-depth released by a national government. It recognises the complexity
    of multi-stakeholder environment and aims to provide a benchmark to all parties
    involved in the manufacturing and supply chain. Governmental and non-governmental
    bodies have released security guidance for transport. Whilst the British guidance
    is particularly comprehensive and it is first to acknowledge the real complexity
    of security due to the multi-stakeholder environment, it is limited to smart vehicles
    only and will require time embed. At the moment, the guidance is not mandatory
    and there is no information available showing the manufacturers will embrace it.
    However, at this point it is clear that the industry is leading the way and thus
    shaping the standards rather than the other way around. Whilst some proprietary
    solutions or frameworks may become the de facto benchmark for others to follow,
    the standards will require time and appropriate approach from the city councils
    in order to bring the desired effect to the field of secure IoT. 3.2. Regulatory
    framework Legal regulation and policy tend to take time to catch up with the innovation
    and new technology. The key legal regulation currently in place is Computer Misuse
    Act 1990, which introduced criminal offences for incidents regarding unauthorised
    access to computer material, commission of offences using computers or unauthorised
    modification of computer material. This act will remain valid in the emergence
    of smart cities and will capture any intentional security incidents regarding
    smart city technology. However, this offers a very traditional view to cyber crime/attacks.
    The act is unable to encompass the emerging legal issues from the IoT and smart
    cities due to their inherent complexity. Dowden has noted where potential legal
    challenges may arise. To date, there is no guidance found on liabilities concerning
    a product failure, i.e. a crash involving a self-driving car or failure to administer
    medication due to a cyber breach (Dowden, 2016). This suggests that in cases where
    incidents are caused by a fault or vulnerability in a third party product, there
    is no law to ensure that the manufacturer presumes responsibility. As a result,
    this places the end user with no guarantees to be compensated. In cases where
    a third party product is directly embedded in the smart city infrastructure, the
    responsibility and damages will be absorbed by the smart city council. There have
    not yet been any cases regarding product liability in the IoT/smart city context;
    therefore it is hard to predict how the courts would react. However, due to lack
    of specific regulations in place for product failure, the courts are likely to
    invoke the contractual duty of care, as defined in the landmark case of AC 562
    (v Stevenson, 1932). The case established that a manufacturer owes a duty of care
    if it is reasonably foreseeable that a failure in ensuring product’s safety would
    lead to harm of the user. However, this would only apply to individual end users
    as organisations, including the smart cities would have contractual agreements
    in place taking precedence over the duty of care. It is difficult to determine
    whether this would be a cause of action or whether the courts may see IoT/smart
    city as a completely different issues, however it may render a possible remedy
    to affected users. Another area of uncertainty lays with data privacy, in particular
    ownership, processing, use and security of data generated by the IoT devices in
    view of multiple commercial and public stakeholders. The Data Protection Act (DPA)
    1998 is the data protection regulation that is currently in place in the UK. The
    key take away from the DPA is its duty to notify users of any loss of personal
    data. The act is a direct transposition of a EU data protection Directive 95/46/EC.
    However, the 1995 Directive has been superseded by the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in 2018 May. As it is a Regulation rather
    than a Directive, it does not require a local transposition into laws but rather
    is effective immediately. It applies to all businesses and bodies dealing with
    personal data. GDPR is applicable to both controllers and processors of data.
    Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has defined the controller as a body that
    defines how and why personal data is processed and the processor as the body that
    acts on the controller’s instructions (Office, 2017). Essentially, it requires
    that all parties involved in data handling (storage and transfer included) comply
    with the Regulation. Contrary to the DPA, the Regulation ascertains significantly
    more liability to the processor of data rather than placing the responsibility
    and liability for breaches on the controller entirely. The processor is required
    to maintain records of data and the processing that has taken place. However,
    where the processor is deemed to be responsible for the breach, this will not
    alleviate the controller from responsibility. The Regulation puts forward additional
    requirements on the processor to ensure that the contracts comply with the GDPR
    (Office, 2017). UK has now confirmed that it will uphold the GDPR despite leaving
    the EU. Lack of compliance with the regulation will mean not only reputational
    damage but also a ground-breaking 4% of the annual turnover in financial fines.
    This regulation is a step forward in defining the ownership of security and data
    protection for Smart City and IoT. It clearly sets out the importance of clear
    contractual agreements and demands compliance with the regulation by all parties
    involved. However, it also reiterates that the contracting party, in this case,
    the City, will always bear some level of responsibility when breaches happen.
    Importantly, this Regulation applies internationally, where the data processed
    is of EU nationals. This will allow ascertaining some level of liability to third
    parties operating outside the EU, but serving the citizens within the EU (Office,
    2017). In addition to the liability challenges, further issues regarding security
    and data protection stem from public-private partnerships and the involvement
    from the commercial actors. The overall concepts of privacy by design, which are
    being presented by the GDPR, seem contrary to the idea of Smart City, where big
    data and its analytics are the key enablers for the IoT and Smart City initiatives.
    More importantly, due to the cloud prevalence and data storage worldwide, it is
    debatable whether privacy and data security are even feasible in practice (Dowden,
    2016). To illustrate the complexity, the EU is persistent on consent when it comes
    to data sharing and data privacy. Requirement of consent was introduced as part
    of the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC), which solidified into a click-through
    consent to cookie tracking on websites. Questions are raised regarding how the
    equivalent would be addressed in the field of IoT, in particular wearable technology
    which may film or record outsiders and process data on the streets (Corbet, 2015).
    Another aspect of law, which may require a reshuffle, is privacy law. The landmark
    decision of Von Hannover (Nohlen, 2006) concerning photographs of the princess
    playing tennis, which were later published, constitutes a breach on the grounds
    of expectation of privacy. Questions are raised regarding how such principles
    will be transformed to accommodate data collected in the smart city or even in
    a smart home. These legal questions currently remain unanswered. Whilst there
    is no specific regulation or official guidance that directly apply to IoT and
    smart cities, it can only be speculated what approach will be taken to stretch
    the current regulations into the digital space. The complexity arises where the
    government is keen to protect its critical assets and the industry continues desiring
    to operate freely and without imposed restrictions (Review, 2017). However, due
    to the immense data and privacy implications that the smart cities bring, it is
    important that the regulators start thinking about these challenges and help shape
    innovation ensuring that privacy and security are observed by design, without
    stifling it. 4. Case studies: Barcelona, Singapore and London 4.1. Research method
    A quantitative case study of Barcelona, Singapore and London using publicly available
    information has been conducted. The goal of this study is to quantify and confirm
    findings identified by the literature review and analysis above. We selected Barcelona,
    Singapore and London as these cities have been reported as the most developed
    smart cities (Sorrell, 2016). Factors such as adoption of smart grid technologies,
    smart lighting, smart traffic, Wi-Fi access points, use of smartphones and available
    applications were assessed as part of this research. In addition, these cities
    are at the forefront of smart city development and therefore will have the most
    publicly available data for the study. The research method consists of review
    and inspection of publicly available information including academic articles,
    official websites, news reports focusing on (1) governance model applied, (2)
    security measures implemented, (3) standards used in the development and (4) third
    party approach adapted. The purpose of this study is to provide first hand evidence
    to support the above-identified findings. Specifically, the study will provide
    insight into how smart cities are being developed; whether the governance approach
    is defined at the beginning of the development; whether technical standards have
    been upheld or adhered to, noting the leading standards if any; and finally it
    will show whether security and risk within the third party management has been
    assessed and appropriate measures taken on the onset. The data is collected using
    a search of academic databases and the open source. 4.2. Barcelona Barcelona is
    deemed as one of the smart city pioneers. Barcelona’s smart city project started
    in 2012 with the deployment of IoT technology across public transit, parking,
    street lighting and waste management (Adler, 2016). The overall initiative consisted
    of 83 individual projects and utilized the fiber optic internet across the city.
    It serves as the key enabler for the integrated IoT systems.Barcelona has a defined
    strategy in place and considers the following (Gascó, 2016), • To define the city
    model “mantra”; (“mantra” is defined as “a city of productive neighbourhoods,
    at human speed, interconnected, eco-efficient, re-naturalized, energetically self-sufficient,
    and regenerated at zero emissions, inside a high-speed interconnected Metropolitan
    Area”) • To analyse the structure of the city and define action plans; • To rethink
    the systems of the city; • To develop the economy of the city services along with
    the ecosystem; • To make the city more resilient and promote long-term investment;
    • To make the city liveable, increasing public space for people; • To change the
    organisation, breaking the “silos”; • To work with other cities and to be part
    of the City Protocol Society. To date, the project has resulted in significant
    cost savings and increased quality of life for the citizens. It is estimated that
    the ‘smartification’ has led to $58 million on water savings, boosted parking
    revenues by $50 million and savings of $37 million due to smart lighting a year
    (Adler, 2016). Barcelona’s key smart city innovations are focused on its transport
    system, smart shelters and bus stops, smart bicycle sharing system, smart parking,
    pneumatic waste management, smart lighting, use of renewable energy and use of
    apps for urban mobility (City, 2017). Barcelona Smart city aims to define, design
    and develop a reference model of a network management platform and sensor data
    for a Smart city and validate it in a major city (Gea et al., 2013). It relies
    on open source rather than proprietary platforms. 4.2.1. What governance model
    has been applied? Gasco has analysed Barcelona’s management and organisation following
    Chourabi’s integrated framework (Gascó, 2016). The analysis has showed that Barcelona’s
    management is part of a broader model, which encourages territorial decentralization,
    service externalization and the adoption of managerial tools. The Mayor of the
    city has actively supported the development of the city. Specific offices have
    been established to deal and develop the strategy. Those are Urban Habitat, The
    Computer Municipal Institute, and Smart City Personal Management Office. Further,
    Barcelona has involved a number of stakeholders in the development and defining
    of the strategy, including businesses and universities. However, the leadership
    lies in the hands of the City Council. Gasco noted that public-private partnerships
    played a key role in developing the city (Gascó, 2016). The city has been set
    up to ensure that citizens are involved and the governance model is transparent.
    This model is expressed via a citizens’ complaints bureau, Bustia Ciutadana, which
    allows reporting breakages or making suggestions. It also has developed an application
    named IDBCN, which enables citizens to digitally and remotely identify themselves.
    Further, Open Data Barcelona is accessible to all, which contains data on election,
    population, economy and other, which facilitates citizens with inception of new
    services and businesses (City, 2017). 4.2.2. What security measures have been
    implemented? Review of available data (in English) has not indicated what security
    measures have been adapted by the City. Further, our review of the open source
    documents noted that cyber security does not feature frequently in a high level
    discourse of the Barcelona smart city. 4.2.3. What standards have been used in
    the development? Review of available data has not indicated what specific standards
    have been used in the development of the Barcelona smart city. In addition, no
    specific standards have been mandated going forward. The study has found that
    one of the key lessons from Barcelona’s smart city projects is in fact lack of
    standards; this has been corroborated by the development of an open source solution
    rather than relying on proprietary solutions. Furthermore, lack of standards for
    data handling and encoding has resulted in a difficulty, especially due to a number
    of invested interests and requirements - public administration, citizens and third
    parties (Gea et al., 2013). 4.2.4. What third party approach has been adapted?
    The city’s strategy suggested that programmes and projects should be implemented
    as part of the public-private partnerships, including academia and other research
    centres (Gascó, 2016). Barcelona places a lot of emphasis on innovation by the
    citizens and enterprises. This can be evidenced by the 22@Barcelona. 22@Barcelona
    is a regeneration project and it provides a space for urban planning and entrepreneurialism.
    It is a space for municipal leaders to collaborate with the private sector, universities
    and communities to speed up innovation. For example, the city’ irrigation system
    is a joint venture (Laursen, 2017). Other examples of public-private partnerships
    include Barcelona GIX project, the Integrated Management of Municipal IT Networks.
    Due to the public-private partnership, the project was well governed and the cost
    was found to be lower. Similarly, Worldsensing and its smart parking system is
    also a joint venture between the city and a private enterprise, which was developed
    at 22@Barcelona. The city provided space for developing and allowed for the product
    to be piloted on Barcelona streets (Laursen, 2017). Whilst this approach is highly
    collaborative and fosters innovation, review found little data to suggest a comprehensive
    assurance model towards third parties. This view can be corroborated by previously
    discussed and self-identified issue of lack of encoding and data handling standards.
    4.3. Singapore Singapore has taken a slightly different approach towards ‘smartification’.
    Specifically, it aims to involve the full government and the full nation in developing
    it (Seng, 2016). Singapore’s smart city project dubbed as ‘Smart Nation’ initiative
    is coordinated by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office in the Prime
    Minister’s Office, with support of other governmental agencies. It aims to transform
    five key domains: • Transport • Home & Environment • Business productivity • Health
    and enabled ageing • Public sector services The project was established in 2014
    (Smartnation.sg., 2017). It involves universities, cultivates a community of start-ups,
    partners with the industry and corporations to sponsor labs and R&D. Further,
    it is enabling the population with the skills necessary for the Smart Nation (Seng,
    2016). The examples of the initiatives that have been implemented by Singapore
    include smart home technologies, autonomous road transport, and healthcare. Similarly
    to Barcelona, it has an open data platform, which is accessible by the public
    and private companies, and a Living Laboratory - a district designed for fostering
    innovation and piloting solutions (Hoe, 2016). To achieve these initiatives, the
    city is implementing an advanced info-communications infrastructure and has created
    a platform for data sharing, which is accessible by all. 4.3.1. What governance
    model has been applied? The city governance lies in the hands of the Government.
    Singapore has established the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG),
    a centralised agency, under the Prime Minister’s Office to deal with agencies
    involved in Singapore’s digital transformation (Woo, 2017). The SNDGG consists
    of the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) and GovTech. SNDGO is
    responsible for policy formation and GovTech is responsible for policy implementation.
    SNDGO consists of Smart Nation Programme Office, Digital Governance Directorate
    (MOF) and Government Technology Policy Department (MCI). Singapore government
    aims to digitise public service delivery through its ‘e-government’ drive. It
    aims to implement and supply the infrastructure, policies and enablers to foster
    innovations, encouraging the citizens and businesses to get involved (Smartnation.sg.,
    2017). Singapore as a smart city is slightly different to other cities due to
    its deregulated economic market. As a result, it is willing to experiment and
    does so in an agile way (Wired.com., 2017). However, Singapore is also taking
    a different approach to data handling and management. Rather than setting up a
    Data Operation Centre, it is aiming to develop policies and regulations supported
    by a common platform for data, which in turn can be used by different governmental
    agencies (Keon et al., 2016). Singapore has observed some challenges due to the
    differing stakeholder interests. For example, Seng has stated that whilst both
    the police and transport could use CCTV cameras, steps must be taken to break
    down the silos, understand how duties of maintenance and data connectivity should
    be shared /citeseng2016singapore. Research suggests that measures that could facilitate
    such management have not been implemented yet. 4.3.2. What security measures have
    been implemented? Singapore has addressed the need for cyber security and recognises
    that everyone has a part to play (Hoe, 2016). Singapore has developed a clear
    cyber security strategy, which underpins four core pillars: resilient infrastructure,
    a safe cyberspace, creation of cyber security ecosystem and strong international
    partnerships. This approach is seen as a fundamental part in becoming a truly
    smart city (Seng, 2016). As such, one of the key measures coming out of this strategy
    is strengthening and expansion of the National Cyber Incident Response Team and
    the National Cyber Security Centre (NewsAsia, 2017). In addition to the Singapore’s
    cyber security strategy, the city has also established a Cyber Security Lab as
    a joint venture by University of Singapore and Singtel. The lab has two key objectives:
    to develop a more advanced data analytics techniques and a novel approach to design
    and implementation of systems that observe a ‘Security by design’ approach. The
    lab will work across four different areas of network, data and cloud security;
    predictive security analytics; IoT and Industrial Control Systems and cyber security
    based on quantum technology (World, 2017). Whilst the cyber strategy is a huge
    step forward and indicates Singapore’s seriousness towards having a secure smart
    city, however, review of available data including academic papers, cyber security
    strategies and other publicly available documentation and news reports have provided
    little detail on what security measures have been adopted by Singapore. 4.3.3.
    What standards have been used in the development? The study found no data to suggest
    that specific standards have been adhered to as part of the development to date.
    As a result, Singapore has recognised a necessity for technical standards to ensure
    that data flows seamlessly and all involved actors speak the common language and
    operate in harmony. Information Technology Standards Committee (ITSC) and Internet
    of Things Technical Committee (IoTTC) have roles to play in defining the technical
    specifications for the Smart Nation. The committees work to identify what standards
    need to be defined alongside the strategy (Seng, 2016). So far it has developed
    and defined technical reference documents for the sensor network (TR 38 and TR
    40). The standards, once defined, will be applicable to public and private bodies
    and will help to improve the collaboration. The final goal is to develop standards
    that will cover the end-to-end IoT architecture (Singapore, 2015). In addition,
    Singapore has taken steps to release a new Cyber Security Act. The act will be
    made mandatory for the operators to take cyber security steps and report incidents.
    In addition, it will empower the Cyber Security Agency and will help raise the
    standards of cyber security across all layers. The Act will focus on providing
    a set of standards, protocols and rules for organisations providing services to
    the city. It has not yet established how it is best to enforce the rules (NewsAsia,
    2017). Whilst the study suggests that few measures may have been implemented as
    part of the initial initiative, it is strongly evidenced that Singapore takes
    cyber security seriously and is taking all steps necessary to embed ‘security
    by design’ approach. 4.3.4. What third party approach has been adapted? Singapore
    stands out as a city placing significant reliance on private companies to innovate
    and the government itself presumes the role of an enabler and supporter, rather
    than an innovator itself (Smartnation.sg., 2017). It thrives and encourages an
    attitude of creating and innovating together, with an involvement of its citizens
    and the private sector (Hoe, 2016). As part of this, Singapore has developed a
    start up ecosystem, where venture capitalists and entrepreneurs may work and experiment.
    As a result, Singapore has been ranked as No. 1 for ease of doing business by
    the World Bank (Smartnation.sg., 2017). Whilst this approach is great for collaboration,
    the review has found little data to suggest a comprehensive assurance approach
    to data and service integration. However, as discussed above, the city has taken
    steps to establish regulations and laws, dictating that standards must be followed
    by all parties involved in the development. As such, this approach will facilitate
    and help reduce the third party risks. 4.4. London London smart city initiative
    was started with the opening of an extensive open data store in 2010 and was fully
    embedded with the inception of the Smart London Board in 2013. The Mayor of London
    formed the Smart London Board. The board created the Smart London Plan (Board,
    2016) and define a vision for a smarter London (Anthopoulos, 2017). The strategic
    smart city plan included a number of smart initiatives for citizen engagement,
    data and innovation enhancement. This has been supplemented by a number of labs
    and innovation districts (Anthopoulos, 2017). The notable successful projects
    include widespread Wi-Fi, smart transport and prevalent use of applications. 4.4.1.
    What governance model has been applied? Smart London Board is the key advisor
    on the smart city matters. The Board comprises of academics (e.g. from University
    College London, Imperial College London, etc.), businesses and entrepreneurs (e.g.
    from Siemens, McKinsey, Accenture Health and Public Service, etc.). The Board
    does not have any government representative. They are responsible for advising
    the smart city matters for Greater London Authority. The board also advises on
    how technology could influence the mayoral strategies and policies. It also helps
    improve existing public services and create opportunities for new digital public
    services. The smart city plan as devised by the Board covers key seven areas (Angelidou,
    2016), • Placing Londoners at the heart of the innovation • Having open and accessible
    data • Utilising London’s research abilities and talent • Networking amongst city’s
    stakeholders • Developing smart infrastructure • Having better and more integrated
    City Hall services • Enabling smarter London experience for all The plan is focused
    on the implementation of projects and initiatives and does not provide guidance
    on stakeholder management or security. However, it places focus on the bottom-up
    approach. Similarly to Singapore, it sees the citizens, businesses and entrepreneurs
    as key partners for innovation and suggests a cooperative climate (Angelidou,
    2016). The projects are promoted via the government sites, however they have little
    detail on how they are managed or run. The key challenges for the overall initiatives
    have been identified as connecting people and creating communities, navigation
    and transportation, capturing and using data (Networks, 2017). 4.4.2. What security
    measures have been implemented? UK has released a national cyber security strategy
    for 2016-2021. The strategy did not include the cyber security requirements specific
    to smart cities (Hammond, 2016). Review of other publicly available documentation
    and news reports have provided little detail on what security measures or requirements
    have been observed as part of the Smarter London initiative. Contrary to Singapore,
    cyber security does not feature significantly in the rhetoric of Smart London.
    4.4.3. What standards have been used in the development? United Kingdom and London
    have a few bodies, which have taken the lead with defining technical standards
    relevant to the Smart City and IoT. Specifically, a joint collaboration of Cities
    Standards Institute (CSI) and British Standards Institute (BSI) has so far released
    four standards. These are: • PAS 181, Smart City Framework Guide to establish
    strategies for smart cities and communities • PAS 182, Smart City Concept Model
    Guide to establish a model for data interoperability • PAS 183, Smart Cities Guide
    to establish a decision-making framework for sharing data and information services
    • PAS 184, Smart Cities Guide to develop project proposals for delivering smart
    city solutions As reviewed above in Section 2, these standards are high level
    and provide a more operational or project-based guidance, rather than dictate
    what technical or cyber security elements must be observed. In addition to the
    BSI-CSI standards, UK government has released cyber-security focused principles
    for connected and automated vehicles and a security specification for smart metering.
    The guidance is the most comprehensive in the industry so far, however it is yet
    to be embedded. Via a review of available documentation, the author found little
    information on what technical standards were complied with during the research
    period. 4.4.4. What third party approach has been adapted? London is aiming to
    support the innovation by offering facilities such as ultra-fast broadband, digital
    and physical space to small and medium enterprises. The smart city approach includes
    the support of commercialisation of technology innovation (Angelidou, 2016). However,
    there is little information publicly available that can shed some light on how
    London is managing its third party risk. The key development, as discussed above,
    is the guidance on automated vehicles. The principles are applicable to manufacturers
    and other actors of the supply chain, which should provide some level of assurance
    regarding the security. However, the principles are limited to automated cars
    and are yet to be embedded. 4.5. Key findings and discussion on case studies The
    comparative case study of smart cities quantifies the identified findings. The
    case study findings are summarised in Table 2. This will lead to the formulation
    of the recommended framework for secure smart city development in Section 5. Table

    for automated vehicles and smart meters The case studies have showed that many
    cities fail to have comprehensive and long-term smart city strategies in place
    (Angelidou, 2016). The strategies in place do not take into account management
    of security risks, use of standards or a comprehensive approach towards third
    party risk management. However, the study has showed that the cities do start
    thinking about these risks as they become more and more developed. All cities
    have specific bodies in place that drive the initiatives. However, all three cities
    had a different approach. Governance model. Barcelona had a single governmental
    department responsible for the wider initiative; Singapore has a ‘fully in’ approach
    in place, which means that the whole government is involved and driving the ‘smartification’;
    Barcelona and Singapore placed citizens and innovations at the core of the smart
    city initiative while little information was available regarding this aspect for
    London; finally, London has a Smart London Board in place which advises the Greater
    London Authority on smart city matters. Interestingly, the Board heavily consists
    of big corporate leaders, some academia and no government representatives. This
    is slightly worrisome as such a one-sided approach may steer London to a corporate
    city side rather than a smart city for all citizens. Security Measures. Among
    the three cities studied, Singapore appeared as the most collaborative and the
    most advanced in its approach to cyber security. Whilst still in its infancy,
    it forms Singapore’s long-term approach to embedding cyber security by design.
    Specifically, the committee it has in place alongside the Cyber Security Act is
    building a base of rules and standards that third parties and other private companies
    must adhere to. Contrary to Singapore, Barcelona and London do not seem as vocal
    about what cyber security measures are being implemented or what the strategy
    going forward is. Although UK has released a national cyber security strategy
    for 2016-2021, the strategy did not include the cyber security requirements specific
    to smart cities (Hammond, 2016). IoT and security standards relevant to smart
    cities. Review of available data has not indicated what specific standards have
    been used in the development of the Barcelona smart city. Singapore takes cyber
    security seriously and is taking all steps necessary to embed ‘security by design’
    approach. It has developed two standards for the sensor network (TR 38 and TR
    40). London has two bodies, CSI and BSI, taking the lead with defining technical
    standards relevant to the Smart City and IoT. They released four standards; however
    these standards are high level and provide a project-based guidance. Whilst all
    cities are taking steps to define the standards, they are high level and lack
    the technical aspects that are so necessary for a security-by-design approach.
    Further, little information was available to show what standards all three cities
    have already implemented or used as part of their infrastructure development.
    This corroborates with the previously identified findings regarding non-existent
    and inconsistent use of technical standards. Third part management. Barcelona
    places an emphasis on innovation by the citizens and enterprises, evidenced by
    the 22@Barcelona. Whilst this approach is highly collaborative and fosters innovation,
    review found little data to suggest any risk reduction strategies towards third
    parties. Singapore has taken steps to establish regulations and laws, which will
    facilitate and help reduce the third party risks. The key development in London
    is the guidance on automated vehicles. The principles are applicable to manufacturers
    and other actors of the supply chain, which should provide some level of assurance
    regarding the security. However, the principles are limited to automated cars
    and are yet to be embedded. All three cities are focused on a highly collaborative
    approach and see the citizens and businesses at the heart of its innovation. However,
    limited information was available to demonstrate those cities have implemented
    a comprehensive assurance model towards third party risk. This can be explained
    by either a lack of a defined process or by a limitation of data available. These
    findings combined with the literature review, which has showed that little attention
    is being paid to managing the stakeholders and third party appropriately, suggest
    that smart cities studied are yet to define an appropriate process. To conclude,
    the above analysis and the case studies have showed that unless the ecosystem
    for the smart city is highly cooperative and collaborative, the innovation will
    be stifled and the smart city idea will not succeed. Lee and Whang has recognised
    the difficulty between the flexible integration and security among third parties
    in the more traditional supply chain context (Lee and Whang, 2000). However, this
    complexity is ever increasing in the smart city framework as illustrated by the
    literature review and the case studies above. Therefore there are two key points,
    which have to be satisfied to render a valid security framework for smart cities:
    (a) easy collaboration and data sharing amongst the ecosystem; and (b) security
    is observed at all levels and stages of the ecosystem without slowing down the
    collaboration. 5. Recommendations As the industry is still in its infancy, the
    smart cities globally and the City Councils behind them learn as they go. Experiment
    and by trial and error find ways that prove effective and efficient in developing
    the initiatives. Unsurprisingly, the academia and technical standards trail behind
    whilst the industry are creating de facto frameworks and guidelines to follow.
    However, whilst in some cases this may prove appropriate, it often neglects the
    security by design and puts the infrastructure and its citizens at risk of cyber-physical
    breaches. Furthermore, lack of appropriate framework could lead to the city being
    overly centralized or overly privatised, resulting in an imbalanced approach,
    stifled innovation or an uncontrolled environment, placing the infrastructure
    and citizens at risk. Therefore, it is paramount that the right balance is struck
    ensuring that responsible innovation continues at a speed whilst observing security
    by design principles (Hoe, 2016). As the government is the main owner, it is important
    it takes appropriate steps to ensure security and minimise liability in cases
    incidents happen. 5.1. Technical standards The case study shows that the standards
    have not yet been adopted by the industry and have not been noted as mandatory
    requirements. IEEE has also noted that security elements are often not developed
    as part of the initial design, but rather is considered as an afterthought of
    the IoT initiatives (Association, 2015). Prescriptive standards are paramount
    to smart cities as the tech vendors contributing and providing solutions will
    frequently be small and medium enterprises and start ups. Kaspersky lab has noted
    that 57% of small businesses do not invest into security solutions (Global). This
    could lead to a compromise of a whole platform or a smart city. A study conducted
    by HP of 10 IoT devices in use today shows that on average a device had 25 vulnerabilities,
    totalling 250 vulnerabilities across 10 IoT devices (Miessler, 2014). Pishva stated
    that the security issues cannot be dealt with by a single vendor or manufacturer
    (Pishva, 2017); instead, an adherence to certain standards must become as the
    norm of smart city appliance development. As the analysis has showed, there are
    a high number of technical standards that are related to the IoT or Smart City.
    The variety of standards is overwhelming, they are not sufficiently comprehensive
    and there is little guidance on which standards are key. Therefore, it is paramount
    that a set of baseline security standards is drafted, which apply principles rather
    than rules, ensuring they can be scaled up or down, depending on the product or
    service. It is important that technical standards provide coverage for application
    and code development to embed the security by design principles. 5.2. Government
    input The NCA report on cyber threat to business has noted that the government
    has a part to play in embedding the ‘security by design’ principles. This has
    materialised to an extent and resulted in the development of a standard by the
    National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Department for Business, Energy
    & Industrial Strategy on a secure smart metering system. This is one of the first
    steps for the government on the road to ‘secure by design’ destination (Agency,
    2016). However, to date, there has not been an appropriately defined strategy
    in place for smart cities in the UK (Phys.org., 2017). The government should define
    a harmonised cyber security framework, which includes all stakeholders including
    operators, manufacturers and other actors. The government should act as a coordinator
    and the framework would integrate cyber security standards and an appropriate
    risk management approach (BACHLECHNER et al., 2017). Specifically it should, •
    Whilst the government is able to release specific security standards it may not
    always be best equipped to do so. Therefore, it is important the government sets
    out clearly which standards are mandatory for all actors of the ecosystem of smart
    city. • Following the identification and definition of key standards, the government
    should define the standard operating processes for data management and handling
    for smart city. These guidelines should be mandatory and apply to all actors of
    the ecosystem of smart city. • As the owner of the smart city, the government
    must also define a set of procedures for the supply chain. Specifically, defined
    timely assurance requirements and clear contractual agreements are paramount to
    ensure that only secure third party providers are integrated in the critical smart
    city infrastructure. • The government should also define the minimum security
    requirements or a security level for all smart home and personal devices and require
    for that level to be clearly noted on the packaging to appropriately inform the
    user. As it is impossible to enforce specific security standards to fourth or
    fifth parties, labelling may be an appropriate step to allow end users to make
    choices when it comes to purchasing gadgets and technology. As a result, the government
    must also produce clear guidance for the end user to secure their internal networks.
    As IEEE has noted, it is the responsibility of the owner to train its citizens
    to protect first their data and secondly the integrity and security of the smart
    city as a whole. • It must specifically define the responsibilities of the senior
    management in cyber security at the framework level. It must also define the requirements
    of a well-equipped Security Operations Centre and a Cyber Security Incident Response
    Team (CSIRT). This would allow increasing the readiness against the cyber attacks
    (BACHLECHNER et al., 2017). • Roles and responsibilities of every actor within
    the smart city ecosystem must be identified at both business-as-usual state and
    in a cyber attack case. This would allow the actors to better understand the rights
    and duties and ensure business continuity and safety of the citizens (BACHLECHNER
    et al., 2017). • Finally, it must ensure that cyber knowledge and information
    of breaches are shared within the eco-system in a collaborative and timely manner
    to ensure that the effect of such incidents is minimised. The framework must consist
    of principles rather than guidelines to ensure that new technologies are captured
    and it can be scaled easily. However, where certain standards are defined, adherence
    to them should be strict and mandatory. 5.3. Regulatory framework Whilst the regulators
    should start thinking how the current regulatory framework could be adapted, it
    is likely it will change organically on a case-to-case basis. Currently, there
    seems to be sufficient regulation in place regarding data protection; however
    the difficulty may arise with the extensive data handling and consent that inevitably
    will come with IoT and Smart city. 5.4. Compliance assurance Finally, compliance
    testing and certifications should form part of the cyber security framework for
    smart cities. As adherence to technical standards should start at the application
    or code development stages, it should lead to security by design approach in all
    products that will form the smart city ecosystem. However, to confirm compliance
    the third parties should complete annual testing and certification. An independent
    party, such as an internal or external auditor, should perform testing and certification.
    This would give a reasonable level of assurance to the regulator that all key
    smart city ecosystem actors observe security by design. 6. Conclusion and future
    work Not that long ago smart cities seemed like a utopian dream. However, with
    the technology improving faster than ever before, it is no longer just a dream
    but a reality. Whilst still in its infancy, it promises to revolutionise the lives
    of the people, increase economic efficiency and decrease environmental output.
    However, with all these significant benefits, there also come security risks.
    As the smart cities are entirely reliant on technology, this opens up more doors
    to cyber attackers and criminals, leading to significant material, economic and
    at times even fatal losses. As such, it is paramount to observe cyber security
    at all layers of the city. Collaboration, open innovation as well as ascertain
    a agility despite complex intertwined structure is fundamental to the success
    of any smart city. However, as the analysis has shown, this is also often the
    culprit of security deficiencies. The real difficulty for observing security stems
    from the complexity of the smart city ecosystem and involvement of a high number
    of competing actors and stakeholders. As the cities are still developing, many
    fail to take these risks into account and develop an appropriate third party management
    approach. One of the key symptoms of this deficiency is lack of appropriate standards
    and guidance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and a common understanding
    of key security requirements. The case studies of Barcelona, Singapore and London
    has emphasised and corroborated the importance of technical standards, cyber security
    measures and an effective third party management approach. In turn, this paper
    has suggested a framework of recommendations to ensure that security is observed
    by design from the onset of the smart city development. The framework suggests
    that the government acts as a policy setter and a coordinator in order to define
    and mandate the technical standards and define the minimum security requirements.
    Further, the government should require a clear definition of roles and responsibilities,
    key processes and procedures for data handling and management and a set of procedures
    and requirements for third party and supply chain management. Introduction of
    the suggested framework would allow and encourage collaboration in a secure capacity
    without unnecessarily stifling any innovation. It would lead to security being
    observed by design and drive good security practices in other companies and manufacturers.
    Smart cities are the way forward, however as they are still amidst their infancy,
    steps should be taken to ensure that they are secure, robust, resilient and managed
    continuously during operations. Only if security is observed by design, will smart
    cities improve the lives of the citizens and deliver on the promised benefits.
    The research conducted is based on publicly available information review. As smart
    cities may not share information openly, a field study or interviews with developers
    of the smart cities will compliment and confirm our findings, which will be our
    next stage work. Conflict of interest None. Appendix A. Standards related to IoT

    \ Smart grid integrates computer, communication, and sensing technologies into\
    \ existing\npower grid networks to achieve signiﬁcant informatization-related\
    \ advantages. It will provide\ncommunication between neighbors, localized management,\
    \ bidirectional power transfer, and effective\ndemand response. Smart grids (SG)\
    \ replace conventional grids by integrating various operational\nmeasures, including\
    \ smart automation appliances, smart meters, and renewable energy sources.\nRegarding\
    \ energy management and resolving energy issues, SG is one of the most cutting-edge\
    \ and\npotentially game-changing innovations. Even still, its complexity suggests\
    \ that decentralization may\nprovide signiﬁcant gains. Because of its increasing\
    \ digitization and interconnectedness, it is also\nvulnerable to cyber threats.\
    \ Blockchain, in this sense, is a potential SG paradigm solution that provides\n\
    several great beneﬁts. Even though blockchains have been widely discussed to decentralize\
    \ and\nstrengthen smart grid cybersecurity, they have not yet been researched\
    \ in depth from an application\nand architectural standpoint. Blockchain-enabled\
    \ SG applications are the subject of an in-depth\nresearch investigation. Electric\
    \ vehicles (EVs), home automation, energy management systems, etc.,\nare only\
    \ a few of the many examples that have prompted the proposal of blockchain designs\
    \ for\ntheir respective use cases. Information communication network security\
    \ is of paramount importance.\nHowever, this evolving system raises cybersecurity\
    \ issues. This paper aims to guide researchers\nin the right manner so they may\
    \ build blockchain-based, secure, distributed SG applications in the\nfuture.\
    \ This article also summarizes cybersecurity threats pertaining to smart grids.\
    \ It starts with a\ndescription of a blockchain followed by the blockchain infrastructure,\
    \ challenges, and solutions for\ndifferent smart grid applications. A look back\
    \ at the tried-and-true methods of securing a power grid\nis offered, and then\
    \ it discusses the newer and more complex cybersecurity threats to the smart grid.\n\

    \ \nFor over a century, electricity has been transmitted from generation to customer\
    \ end \nusing a one-directional conventional grid system. However, as human civilization\
    \ pro-\ngresses rapidly, more fossil fuel-powered power plants are used, resulting\

    \ load shedding. These characteristics also help prevent cascade failures. \n\
    A great deal of data about the grid’s markets, service providers, and operations\

    Given the rise in popularity of alternative energy sources, faster signal processors,\
    \ \nsmarter sensors, etc., the power grid is experiencing rapid evolution. The\
    \ current need \ncalls for a two-way exchange of data and energy between power\
    \ producers and consum-\ners [1]. As a result, the conventional power grid is\
    \ transitioning into a smart grid (SG), a \nsystem that can dynamically monitor\
    \ and manage electricity flow, giving customers stable \npower [2]. Smart grid\
    \ integrates computer, communication, and sensing technologies into \nexisting\
    \ power grid networks to achieve these significant informatization-related ad-\n\

    \ (AMI) \nare some of the most prominent examples of SG applications [2]. \nSG\
    \ improves power supply dependability and makes various complex and difficult\
    \ \napplications a reality [3]. Multiple entities in the grid conduct transactions\

    \ analysis.\n2. Overview of Blockchain\nBlockchain technology has gained much\
    \ interest in recent years. Blockchain was\nﬁrst deﬁned as a cryptocurrency [20]\
    \ when it was ﬁrst developed for digital money use.\nBlockchain was once thought\
    \ to be Bitcoin, the most widely used cryptocurrency. However,\nblockchain is\
    \ what really makes these digital currencies tick. It is a decentralized transaction\n\
    ledger that several parties may use. Researchers initially had the least interest\
    \ in this\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n4 of 29\ntechnology, but Bitcoin’s success\
    \ ultimately swayed them. There was a sharp increase in\nthe number of blockchain\
    \ applications and usage in different technological areas after 2016.\nFinancial\
    \ services, medical care, manufacturing, and other sectors are among those which\n\
    have implemented blockchain more deeply.\nBlockchain is a chain of blocks of transactions\
    \ recorded in series in which various\nadministrators oversee the operation of\
    \ classic client/server systems. Blockchain is a P2P\nnetwork [21] in which all\
    \ users have equal control over the network’s direction and opera-\ntion. Many\
    \ computers, or nodes, are linked together to form this network, and the blocks\n\
    in the chain cannot be altered without the network’s consent. A record of the\
    \ centralized\ndatabase is stored locally on each node in the network [22]. The\
    \ speciﬁcs of a given use\ncase will determine the type of blockchain used. Public\
    \ blockchains, private blockchains,\nand consortium blockchains are the three\
    \ main categories of blockchain [23]. Three types of\nblockchains exist: public,\
    \ private, and consortium. In a public or permissionless blockchain,\nno one may\
    \ exert authority. Users are not restricted in their ability to read or write\
    \ to the\nnetwork. On the other side, private or permissioned ledgers are inaccessible\
    \ to anybody\nwho is not logged into the network as an authorized user.\nThe blocks\
    \ are unreadable because they are protected with an encryption key. Con-\nsortium\
    \ blockchains include both the public and private blockchain models. In contrast\
    \ to\ncentralized systems, the nodes in a blockchain network verify transactions\
    \ among them-\nselves in a decentralized manner [24]. Once a transaction has been\
    \ veriﬁed by the nodes and\nuploaded to the blockchain, there is no way to undo\
    \ it since the identiﬁcation of the network\nnodes stays unanimous. So, the data\
    \ stored on the blockchain cannot be altered [25].\nWhile blockchain technology\
    \ has shown promise for building a better infrastructure\nof the future Internet,\
    \ there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved. Due to the\nimmaturity\
    \ of blockchain’s development, having access to knowledgeable individuals is\n\
    essential. Businesses are understandably concerned about the hefty upfront infrastructure\n\
    costs associated with BCT adoption, despite the many promising applications of\
    \ this\ntechnology. Privacy and security considerations also play a role in the\
    \ spread of blockchain\ntechnology. Legal considerations and difﬁculty scaling\
    \ it up are also major concerns [26].\nTerminologies and Components of Blockchain\n\
    Below are some deﬁnitions of terms used to deﬁne the critical parts of a blockchain:\n\
    Block: Pointers and linked lists are used to represent blocks in a blockchain.\
    \ Blocks\nare organized into a sensible hierarchy and aligned with one another\
    \ using a linked list. A\nblock is a collection of data that is created by a secure\
    \ hash algorithm and contains details\nabout a transaction, such as timestamps\
    \ and references to previous blocks. Pointers show\nwhere the next block is located.\
    \ The block header and the block body are the two parts of\nevery block [27].\
    \ Below are the ﬁelds that make up the block header [28]:\ni.\nBlock version:\
    \ it deﬁnes the criteria for validating blocks.\nii.\nMerkle tree root hash: the\
    \ total hash value of all transactions in the frame is calculated\nusing this\
    \ hashing algorithm.\niii.\nTimestamp: it is represented in seconds in universal\
    \ time, as of 1 January 1970.\niv.\nn-Bits: the target size of a block hash.\n\
    v.\nNonce: it refers to a 4-byte ﬁeld that begins at 0 and increases by 1 with\
    \ each\nhash calculation.\nvi.\nParent block hash: the 256-bit hash value of the\
    \ previous block is often known as the\nparent block hash.\nPublic and private\
    \ keys: Blockchain is a system of interconnected, cryptographically\nsecured blocks\
    \ that is always growing [29]. Blockchain uses an asymmetric key mechanism\nto\
    \ verify transactional authentication. A private key is used to encrypt a block’s\
    \ transactions.\nThese transactions are accessible to any node in the network.\
    \ When using a public key that\nis accessible to all nodes in the network, these\
    \ nodes can decrypt the data.\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n5 of 29\nHash function:\
    \ Every block contains a cryptographic hash that is connected to the\npreceding\
    \ block. To specify a piece of data, hashing generates a ﬁxed-length string. The\n\
    string’s length is irrespective of the data’s size.\nConsensus procedure: A set\
    \ of standards and agreement from all network users\nare used to validate new\
    \ blocks. To decide whether or not a block is valid, consensus\nis required. For\
    \ the consensus procedure, a number of methods are available, including\nrealistic\
    \ byzantine fault tolerance, proof of work, and proof of stake.\nSmart contracts:\
    \ In a blockchain network, smart contracts are computer programs that\nrun automatically\
    \ and regulate the transactions between dispersed nodes.\n3. Operation Blockchain\
    \ for Smart Grids Applications\nBy fostering more trust and promoting greater\
    \ decentralization, blockchain technology\nhas the potential to alter existing\
    \ applications drastically. However, the beneﬁts it offers\nare not being fully\
    \ used by SG applications despite its increasing expansion [30]. The total\npublications\

    41% about energy management systems, 19% on microgrids, 24% on electric vehicles,\
    \ 14%\non home automation, and 2% on AMI. Scopus was used to compile these numbers,\
    \ and\nonly journal papers were examined. In a SG, blockchain is extensively used\
    \ for energy\nmanagement purposes. The application of blockchain technology has\
    \ also expanded to\ninclude electric vehicles, advanced metering infrastructure,\
    \ microgrids, home automation,\nand smart cities [31].\n3.1. Blockchain for Home\
    \ Automation\nThe resistance and RMS value of a current describe the conduction\
    \ losses. The output\nis a smart home that is an IoT-integrated residence that\
    \ improves the quality of life in\nmany ways, including safety, healthcare, pleasure,\
    \ and convenience. Technology for the\nhome has improved the quality of life and\
    \ allowed more people to live independently.\nConsumers and IT companies are interested\
    \ in smart homes because of their valuable\nfeatures, such as behavior tracking\
    \ and safety assessments. Smart homes have many\nadvantages for homeowners and\
    \ others but are also susceptible to malicious cyberattacks\nthat put consumers\
    \ in danger [32]. Although there are existing methods for countering\nthese threats,\
    \ they are highly centralized and vulnerable to widespread assault. Because\n\
    of this, the cutting-edge sector of automated smart home applications and facilities\
    \ lacks\nthe ﬂexibility and scalability required for productive use. Several advanced\
    \ technologies\nsimplify people’s daily routines. These kinds of applications\
    \ may produce massive amounts\nof data. There are security concerns associated\
    \ with storing this dynamic content in\narchives. Blockchain has been shown to\
    \ be a reliable and effective tool in the ﬁeld of\nremote connection and data\
    \ transfer in cybersecurity. As a result, it is being used for home\nautomation\
    \ [33].\nBlockchain-based HA infrastructure refers to the use of several electronic\
    \ gadgets\n(smart TVs, lighting, etc.), either working autonomously or in concert\
    \ with one another\nto monitor the various settings of smart homes. To realize\
    \ the potential of HA, these\nintelligent gadgets must be able to communicate\
    \ with one another. An IoT gateway\nsolves the problems that arise when several\
    \ smart devices need to communicate with one\nanother [34]. To prevent a security\
    \ breach, such as to prevent users in one house from\naccessing the electronics\
    \ devices in another house, the service provider is responsible for\nmaking control\
    \ suggestions to the users’ smart devices on the basis of smart intelligent\n\
    algorithms. Service providers may employ machine learning algorithms to provide\
    \ more\naccurate suggestions and forecasts. Connecting consumers and service providers\
    \ over a\nblockchain network improves HA security [35]. Possibly Ethereum or Hyperledger\
    \ will\nbe used to create the blockchain. A blockchain’s overarching design for\
    \ HA is shown in\nFigure 3.\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n6 of 29\n \ncontrol suggestions\

    \ devices and \ncannot interact with the smart devices in the neighborhood’s smart\
    \ homes. All household \ngadgets may connect directly to the blockchain system\
    \ through the gateway. Blocks con-\ntaining device data may be linked using the\
    \ blockchain’s hashing algorithm. The service \nprovider can provide data analysis\
    \ and user-friendly recommendations, but it cannot \nhave access to a smart home’s\
    \ actual gadgets themselves. Through the gateway, all of the \ngadgets in a house\
    \ may communicate with the blockchain network. \nChallenges and Solutions: Many\
    \ different blockchain technologies are being put to \nuse in HA-related projects\
    \ right now [36]. Each system’s data are stored in a unique for-\nmat, making\
    \ integration difficult. Furthermore, these networks utilize various consensus\
    \ \ntechniques. Interoperability across different blockchain platforms will only\
    \ be possible if \nthey are standardized. A further difficulty in using blockchain\
    \ for HA applications is per-\nforming real-time analytics on streaming data.\
    \ They need to be analyzed and evaluated \nin real time. For instance, real-time\
    \ face detection is essential in an intrusion detection \nsystem. For real-time\
    \ applications, processing blockchains might be difficult. Using a min-\nimal\
    \ framework might be the answer to this problem. \n3.2. Blockchain for Advanced\
    \ Metering Infrastructure \nEvery consumer’s energy usage data are collected,\
    \ monitored, and sent through a \nsmart meter; this meter is the brain of an AMI\
    \ system. Many various groups have their \nown purposes for these meter data.\
    \ The utility grid may use this information for demand \nforecasting and scheduling,\
    \ while the distributor can utilize the information from smart \nmeters to implement\
    \ pricing structure and invoicing. On the other side, users may use \nthis information\
    \ for energy management purposes [37]. Despite the many benefits of AMI, \ntransferring\
    \ data across devices safely is difficult. A key component in reaching this goal\
    \ \nis the blockchain-based AMI. Figure 4 presents a general approach for integrating\
    \ block-\nchain technology into AMI. \nFigure 3. Blockchain’s overarching design\

    \ incorporated energy management platform\nand a bilateral trading mechanism that,\
    \ according to the simulation ﬁndings, signiﬁcantly\noptimizes energy ﬂow in a\
    \ microgrid. In [60], a different model for blockchain-based energy\nsystems was\
    \ proposed, with a Pythagorean fuzzy technique proposed for selecting the\noptimal\
    \ energy generation, distribution, and disposal. Results indicating greater proﬁtabil-\n\
    ity and lower CO2 emissions were also published in [63], which presents a different\
    \ P2P\nenergy trading method among the distributed generations based on the same\

    \ City\n3.6. Blockchain for Energy Management System\nThe smart city framework\
    \ is rapidly changing because of the proliferation of tech-\nnologies such as\
    \ blockchain, the IoT, and cloud computing. The future of the Internet of\nThings\
    \ (IoT) will determine the design of “smart cities”, including the number and\
    \ type of\nsensors and “smart objects” used to gather information about public\
    \ facilities and services,\nas well as the availability of that information to\
    \ the general public, the effectiveness of envi-\nronmental safeguards, and the\
    \ level of economic growth. Figure 8 depicts an overarching\nblockchain architecture\
    \ for SCs [76]. It would be impractical to run all of the smart city’s\nservices\
    \ on the same blockchain network. Because of this, cities of varying sizes and\
    \ types\nof smart services will need different conﬁgurations of blockchain networks.\
    \ It is possible\nthat each blockchain may be tailored to the speciﬁc needs of\
    \ a particular application. Data\ngenerated by smart equipment (such as smart\
    \ cars, smart houses, and smart hospitals) are\nrecorded in a blockchain. To guarantee\
    \ the services run well, we will need appropriate\ntechniques and blockchain frameworks\

    \ \nSome of the issues with smart city transportation were discussed in [78,79].\
    \ These \nstudies showed how to use blockchain, which allows for the use of distributed\
    \ stored data \nand performs transactions between producers and beneficiaries\
    \ without the need for in-\ntermediaries, such as banks or governments, to improve\
    \ public transportation and logis-\ntics [80,81], water supply [82,83], green\
    \ energy [84,85], the environment [86,87], health \n[88,89], and education [90,91].\
    \ Smart contracts are becoming increasingly important in the \nevolution of transactions\
    \ between parties, and blockchain architecture will bolster this \ntrend. These\
    \ contracts are initiated by either party’s actions (understandings) or by the\
    \ \nreadings of sensors, actuators, or Internet-of-Thing tags [92]. As a result,\
    \ logistics, energy, \nthe ecosystem, water management, health, and other sectors\
    \ will all benefit from block \nchain technology as they help transform communities\
    \ into smart cities. \nFigure 8. Overview of a blockchain architecture for SCs.\n\

    \ are becoming increasingly important in the evolution of\ntransactions between\
    \ parties, and blockchain architecture will bolster this trend. These con-\ntracts\
    \ are initiated by either party’s actions (understandings) or by the readings\
    \ of sensors,\nactuators, or Internet-of-Thing tags [92]. As a result, logistics,\
    \ energy, the ecosystem, water\nmanagement, health, and other sectors will all\
    \ beneﬁt from block chain technology as they\nhelp transform communities into\
    \ smart cities.\nChallenges and Solution: Entities in smart cities come in a wide\
    \ variety. Smart city\nentities employ various blockchain networks, each optimized\
    \ for particular use cases.\nWhen it comes to smart transportation, for instance,\
    \ the devices are constantly moving to\nnew spots, but they are static in terms\
    \ of smart illumination. The blockchain’s architecture\nhas to be well thought\
    \ out before use due to the dispersed nature of the entities. There is a\nneed\
    \ for proper research to enhance blockchain technology so that it must be robust\
    \ and\nquick. Furthermore, it might be difﬁcult to obtain data from one blockchain\
    \ network to\nanother in the SC because of a lack of compatibility.\n4. Blockchain-Enabled\
    \ Cybersecurity System for Smart Grids\n4.1. Common Security Risks in Smart Grids\n\
    Smart grids provide a number of possible concerns that might affect both businesses\n\
    and normal consumers. Customers’ personal information, among other sensitive pieces\
    \ of\ndata, may be at danger if the organization suffers any attack. Customers\
    \ are vulnerable\neven when they are not online because enemies may attempt to\
    \ snoop on them and steal\nprivate information. The percentage of cyberattacks\
    \ is higher in the USA compared to any\nother country, which is 73%, while all\
    \ other countries have cyberattacks less than 5%, and\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n\
    15 of 29\nsector wise, the energy sector has the topmost level of cyberattacks,\
    \ which is 51%. It is\ncommon knowledge that cyberattacks may severely damage\
    \ the smart grid. Cyberattacks\nmay compromise a smart grid’s availability, integrity,\
    \ and privacy. Most cyberattacks may\nbe broken down into a wide variety of subtypes,\
    \ making it hard to list them all. The CIA\nClassiﬁcation for smart grid attacks\
    \ is listed in Table 3. This section will introduce several\ncommon forms of cyberattacks\
    \ on the smart grid.\nTable 3. CIA classiﬁcation for smart grid attacks.\nCIA\n\

    \ and Masquerading\n4.1.1. Denial-of Service (DoS) Attacks\nDistributed denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) attack is a kind of cyberattack in which hackers\nsend out false instructions\
    \ to a server or network, causing the service to be interrupted,\neither momentarily\
    \ or permanently, for the target audience [93]. To overburden systems\nand prevent\
    \ incomplete queries, attackers repeatedly send many requests to the targeted\n\
    computer or resource [94]. The standard DoS attack employs a single computer and\
    \ a single\ncommunication link to overwhelm the target network or resource. Distributed\
    \ denial-of-\nservice (DDoS) attacks are similar in nature but use a group of\
    \ computers and networks\nto overwhelm their intended victim. Since it is hard\
    \ to halt the attack by limiting a single\nsource, the consequences of this attack\
    \ might be far more severe [95].\nCurrent denial-of-service and distributed denial-of-service\
    \ (DDoS) attacks on smart\nrids target a variety of communication levels, including\
    \ the application layer, the network\nand transport layers, the media access control\
    \ (MAC) layer, and the physical layer [96].\nDue to their poor computing capabilities,\
    \ application-layer-based DoS/DDoS attacks can\ncompromise millions of ICT devices\
    \ in a smart grid [97]. Extreme data volumes are the\nmainstay of denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on\nthe network and transport\
    \ layers, slowing transmission bandwidth in the communication\nchannels and ultimately\
    \ impairing access for legitimate users. The quality of end-to-end\ncommunications\
    \ is at risk from this form of assault [98]. To gain access to the network by\n\
    reducing the performance of those who use the same communication channel, a DoS/DDoS\n\
    attack at the MAC layer might deliberately tamper with the MAC settings. It is\
    \ common\nknowledge that three types of frames (data frames, control frames, and\
    \ management\nframes) are used to convey information at the MAC layer. While data\
    \ frames are usually\nencrypted, management and control frames are not protected\
    \ in the same way. As a result,\ndenial-of-service and distributed denial-of-service\
    \ attacks may disrupt the control and\nmanagement infrastructure. It is a common\
    \ practice for an attacker to use signal jamming\nto conduct a denial-of-service\
    \ or distributed denial-of-service attack at the physical layer;\nall they need\
    \ is a bridge to the communication channels. According to previous reports,\n\
    jammer assaults on a smart grid may cause anything from delayed delivery of time-critical\n\
    signals to a total denial of service [99].\n4.1.2. False Data Injection Attack\
    \ (FDIA)\nFDIA may have detrimental effects on a power system because it can disrupt\
    \ the state\nestimation process, leading the system operator astray [100]. State\
    \ estimate is often a vital\npart of any control center. It takes raw sensor readings\
    \ from the SCADA system, ﬁlters\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n16 of 29\nthem, and then\
    \ manipulates each bus’s status. Many power system applications rely on\nstate\
    \ estimates’ outcomes [101,102]. False and malicious data information may be used\
    \ to\ndeliberately mislead energy management systems’ control and monitoring functionalities\n\
    (EMSs). Furthermore, a malevolent assault might lead to disastrous outcomes. The\
    \ primary\nresearch foci are the theoretical foundations, practical implications,\
    \ and countermeasures\nof FDIAs. The goal of the theoretical work is to develop\
    \ injection vectors that can evade\ndetection by the command-and-control server\
    \ in a variety of scenarios. On the application\nside, i.e., energy management\
    \ systems (EMS) and market management systems, the effect\nof FDIAs on power system\
    \ functioning is evaluated (MMS). The primary responsibility of\nthe defender\
    \ is to provide system operators with effective defense tactics [103]. A legal\n\
    FDIA may affect the electricity market and energy distribution and disrupt power\
    \ system\noperations. Recently, Xie et al. [104,105] investigated both the ex-ante\
    \ and ex-post effects of\nFDIAs in the electrical market. One of the goals of\
    \ an assault is to increase one’s gain. As a\nrule, they aim to buy virtual power\
    \ cheaply at one node and then resell it to other nodes\nvia an FDIA for proﬁt.\n\
    4.1.3. Phishing\nSince phishing is so simple to do, it might be the initial step\
    \ in exposing companies\nand their consumers to danger. Hackers may get access\
    \ to sensitive information about\nan electricity company if its clients do not\
    \ properly dispose of their bills and payment\nreceipts [106]. However, employees\
    \ may also face threats from inside the company, such\nas phishing emails that\
    \ appear legitimate but really include malware that steals personal\ninformation.\
    \ Giving information to unreliable sources and understanding the ramiﬁcations\n\
    of these threats may have a privacy and ﬁnancial impact on smart grid consumers.\
    \ Hence,\nit is a major issue for designing a defense against phishing assaults\
    \ [107].\n4.1.4. Eavesdropping\nSome forms of spooﬁng attacks include eavesdropping\
    \ and analyzing trafﬁc patterns.\nThe intruder may steal private data by eavesdropping\
    \ on network trafﬁc. Keeping the de-\nvices linked to the broader network, which\
    \ a smart grid relies on, is challenging. Therefore,\nit poses a danger to the\
    \ whole system. Most data security centers are concerned about\nsmart grid since\
    \ it presents the most signiﬁcant threat of data theft [108].\n4.2. Security Breaches\n\
    A smart grid is a technological composite that uses network and communication\n\
    technologies to provide a number of advantages while delivering electricity. Smart\
    \ grids,\nhowever, may be susceptible to the same dangers associated with online\
    \ systems. Numer-\nous security breaches have occurred, and these are examined\
    \ in various papers that detail\nthe effects of certain signiﬁcant cyberattacks\
    \ and provide recommendations for preventing\nsuch assaults in the future [35].\n\
    4.2.1. Trojan-Horse Malware Black Energy\nA cyberattack incident occurred amid\
    \ a civil war scenario on 25th December 2015. A\ncyberattack on an electrical\
    \ power plant in the Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk placed\nthe lives of 80,000\
    \ people in danger by leaving them in the dark. The cyberattack was\nperformed\
    \ by utilizing a spear-phishing email and a Trojan-horse software known as the\n\
    “BlackEnergy” [108]. This was a very destructive virus that could wipe ﬁles, corrupt\
    \ hard\ndrives, and even take over afﬂicted machines. The cyberattack progressed\
    \ further when the\nculprit launched a targeted denial-of-service assault (DoS\
    \ attack) on the industry’s utility\nequipment, disabling the support phone number\
    \ of the operator at the power plant [109].\nTherefore, customers could not report\
    \ the outage because of the DoS attack. This issue\nworsened signiﬁcantly and\
    \ severely since the cyberattack stole information and destabilized\na country’s\
    \ essential infrastructure. Without heat or power, many people perished in the\n\
    bitter cold. This is the single most disastrous event in recent history [110].\n\
    Energies 2023, 16, 820\n17 of 29\n4.2.2. Stuxnet\nStuxnet is a dangerous computer\
    \ worm that attacks SCADA systems (SCADA). In\n2010, Stuxnet was discovered for\
    \ the ﬁrst time (Denning, 2012). It was speculated that the\nUnited States’ and\
    \ Israeli spy services were responsible for developing the Stuxnet [111].\nThe\
    \ harmful Stuxnet computer worm leverages the Microsoft Windows’ operating system\n\
    and networks and is capable of manipulating programmable logic controllers (PLCs),\
    \ which\nare responsible for managing the electromechanical operations of machines.\
    \ The massive\ncomputer worm Stuxnet managed to enter the control system of Iran’s\
    \ Nuclear Power Plant,\nwhere it manipulated the (PLCs) that regulated the centrifuges\
    \ used to separate nuclear\nmaterial, causing them to spin faster than normal\
    \ and rip the machinery apart [112]. In\nresponse to the Stuxnet computer virus,\
    \ the specialized machinery increased their rotational\nspeed and promptly began\
    \ damaging the nuclear fuel. While Stuxnet itself poses little\nthreat to infected\
    \ machines, it does perform a check to determine whether the infected\nmachine\
    \ is linked to certain Siemens PLC types. The United States and Israel designed\n\
    Stuxnet to stop Iran’s nuclear weapon development.\n4.2.3. WannaCry Ransomware\n\
    WannaCry ransomware was a catastrophic piece of software that brought down the\n\
    computers of thousands of average individuals all around the world and crippled\
    \ major\ncorporations, such as Renault and FedEx. On 12 May 2017, the WannaCry\
    \ ransomware was\nreleased. Over 200 thousand machines were infected with the\
    \ WannaCry Ransomware mal-\nware, which locked data and demanded a fee to decrypt\
    \ them [113]. If victims did not pay\nthe USD 300 in bitcoins, the hackers sought\
    \ to decrypt the whole system and threatened to\nwipe all of the system data permanently.\
    \ According to reports, the WannaCry Ransomware\nassault had the greatest effect\
    \ on NHS hospital systems, resulting in the cancellation of over\n19,000 appointments\
    \ and putting many lives at risk. Twenty million pounds in penalties\nand an additional\
    \ seventy-two million pounds in cleaning up and updating the IT systems\nmade\
    \ up the overall cost of rebuilding the NHS’s IT infrastructure [114]. The ransomware\n\
    assault was disseminated in a number of different ways, including via phishing\
    \ emails and\nantiquated computers that lacked the latest Microsoft security updates.\
    \ According to the\njoint investigation conducted by the United States, the United\
    \ Kingdom, and Australia,\nthe assault was carried out by highly skilled hackers\
    \ from North Korea. As computers in\nhospitals are utilized for life-or-death\
    \ surgeries, the focus on this deadly cyberattack has\ncreated a terrible danger\
    \ to human lives [115].\n4.3. Countermeasures against Cyberattacks\nConcerning\
    \ cybersecurity in smart grids, the information and communication net-\nworks\
    \ are particularly exposed to threats and hazards. Practicing certain security\
    \ risks\npreferably requires a security solution to guard against vulnerabilities.\
    \ The greatest chal-\nlenge to a network and system is the dangers and threats\
    \ that it faces. Figure 9 shows\nthe classiﬁcation of smart grid attacks and threats\
    \ from different sources. Protecting the\nintegrity of a smart grid system and\
    \ its data requires a proper protection scheme that can\ncounterattack to a wide\
    \ range of cyberattacks. It is believed that using many defensive mea-\nsures\
    \ at different detecting nodes may achieve a protected and secure system. A distributed\n\
    denial-of-service (DDoS) assault is one of the most signiﬁcant dangers to a smart\
    \ grid\nbecause it may cause the breakdown of the communication networks and control\
    \ systems\nthat are the foundation of the smart grid. The two types of strategies\
    \ against DoS attacks\nfollowed by a discussion of additional counterattacks for\
    \ smart grid is given as follows.\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n18 of 29\n \ncounterattack\
    \ to a wide range of cyberattacks. It is believed that using many defensive \n\
    measures at different detecting nodes may achieve a protected and secure system.\
    \ A dis-\ntributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assault is one of the most significant\
    \ dangers to a smart \ngrid because it may cause the breakdown of the communication\
    \ networks and control \nsystems that are the foundation of the smart grid. The\
    \ two types of strategies against DoS \nattacks followed by a discussion of additional\
    \ counterattacks for smart grid is given as \nfollows. \n \nFigure 9. Classification\
    \ of smart grid attacks and threats from different sources. \n4.3.1. Detection\
    \ and Defense for DoS Attack \nDoS cyberattacks may be initiated from anywhere\
    \ in the globe with access to com-\nmunication networks including the Internet,\
    \ and a smart grid must be able to identify and \ndefend against these attacks.\
    \ Obviously, the first step in taking precautions against as-\nsaults is to identify\
    \ them [116]. Detection based on the signal itself occurs at the physical \nMAC\
    \ layer. By receiving the signal and gauging its intensity, a DoS attack detector\
    \ may \ndetermine whether an attack is in progress and sound an alert if one is.\
    \ Detection based \non individual packets is a method that may be used to evaluate\
    \ the transmission’s success \nacross any number of layers. Given that DoS assaults\
    \ often cause packet loss or delay, and, \nconsequently, a decline in network\
    \ performance, this is a common and efficient strategy. \nDoS attacks may be detected,\
    \ and the security of a network can be tested or measured by \nsending out probe\
    \ packets in advance. The hybrid approach aims to improve the accuracy \nof threat\
    \ detection by designing a single integrated strategy out of two or more methods\
    \ \n[117]. \nDefense, in the form of attack mitigation measures, may be deployed\
    \ to protect a \nnetwork against DoS assaults after they have been identified.\
    \ There are two primary cat-\negories of countermeasures: those that operate at\
    \ the network layer and those that operate \nat the physical layer. Defenses against\
    \ denial-of-service attacks that include some kind of \nFigure 9. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of smart grid attacks and threats from different sources.\n4.3.1. Detection\
    \ and Defense for DoS Attack\nDoS cyberattacks may be initiated from anywhere\
    \ in the globe with access to com-\nmunication networks including the Internet,\
    \ and a smart grid must be able to identify\nand defend against these attacks.\
    \ Obviously, the ﬁrst step in taking precautions against\nassaults is to identify\
    \ them [116]. Detection based on the signal itself occurs at the physical\nMAC\
    \ layer. By receiving the signal and gauging its intensity, a DoS attack detector\
    \ may\ndetermine whether an attack is in progress and sound an alert if one is.\
    \ Detection based\non individual packets is a method that may be used to evaluate\

    \ often cause packet loss or delay, and,\nconsequently, a decline in network performance,\
    \ this is a common and efﬁcient strategy.\nDoS attacks may be detected, and the\
    \ security of a network can be tested or measured\nby sending out probe packets\
    \ in advance. The hybrid approach aims to improve the ac-\ncuracy of threat detection\
    \ by designing a single integrated strategy out of two or more\nmethods [117].\n\
    Defense, in the form of attack mitigation measures, may be deployed to protect\
    \ a\nnetwork against DoS assaults after they have been identiﬁed. There are two\
    \ primary\ncategories of countermeasures: those that operate at the network layer\
    \ and those that\noperate at the physical layer. Defenses against denial-of-service\
    \ attacks that include some\nkind of network layer mitigation are rate limiting,\
    \ ﬁltering, and reconﬁguration. The goal of\nrate-limiting technique is to restrict\
    \ the transmission speed of malicious packets. Filtering\nemploys a ﬁltering system\
    \ based on comparing packet source addresses to a blacklist,\nblocking any suspicious\
    \ trafﬁc so the attacking packets will not reach their intended targets\nin this\
    \ manner. Reconﬁguring the network’s architecture to provide the victim extra\n\
    resources or shut down the attacking nodes is one approach [118]. In a wireless\
    \ smart\ngrid, a wireless jamming attack should be the principal denial-of-service\
    \ attack. Jamming-\nresistant techniques have been developed in recent years to\
    \ reduce the effects of this kind\nof assault. In coordinated control, different\
    \ methods, including direct-sequence spread\nspectrum (DSSS), frequency-hopping\
    \ spread spectrum (FHSS), and chirp spread spectrum\n(CSS), are used to protect\
    \ against wireless cyberattacks. However, in DSSS, the secret is\ndesigned to\
    \ be unknowable to attackers in a straight sequence, while in FHSS, the secret\n\
    is supposed to be unknowable to attackers in a hopping pattern. With uncoordinated\n\
    protocols, a new secret is generated randomly for each conversation, making it\
    \ difﬁcult\nfor the attackers to gather enough knowledge to disrupt the signal.\
    \ This approach holds\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n19 of 29\nsigniﬁcant promise for\
    \ securing wireless communications in a decentralized setting since it\ndoes not\
    \ rely on the transmitter and the receiver sharing an assumed secret [119].\n\
    4.3.2. Encryption\nThe stated encryption encodes data so an unauthorized party\
    \ cannot decode them.\nAny piece of information that is encrypted and then any\
    \ data that the hackers intercept are\nuseless in the form of raw code. Encryption\
    \ may be seen as a kind of hidden coding. A\ncipher is the method by which your\
    \ information is encrypted, and a key is the set of rules\nthat enables you to\
    \ read the message again [120]. The most highly rated VPN services use\n256-bit\
    \ AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), the industry’s strongest encryption standard,\n\
    where 256 is the length of the encryption cipher being employed. With 256-bit\
    \ encryption,\nthe number of possible permutations exceeds the number of stars\
    \ in the Milky Way. Banks\nand governments all across the globe rely on this degree\
    \ of encryption to protect their\nsensitive information [121].\n4.3.3. Authentication\n\
    Robust authentication systems are of utmost importance in situations when it is\
    \ neces-\nsary to maintain authentication and manage access [122]. An “implicit\
    \ deny policy” may\nbe useful in implementing authentication and the policy’s\
    \ usage in allowing only explicit\nusers access to the network. This policy provides\
    \ the business with security solutions and\nallows for the differentiation of\
    \ rights across users (e.g., management can view all extra\ndata linked to projects,\
    \ while workers have restricted access to data). By limiting access to\ntrusted\
    \ employees, you can lessen the likelihood of a security breach and know exactly\
    \ who\nlogged in. In addition, SSL protocols may be used to perform authentication.\
    \ Cyberattacks,\nsuch as denial of service, might compromise the protocols [123].\
    \ Because of the increased\nbandwidth needed for communication inside a smart\
    \ grid network, cryptographic methods\nmay be employed for authentication [124].\n\
    4.3.4. Malware Protection\nMalware protection is essential for a smart grid because\
    \ of the need to secure and\nprotecting the embedded system and the general-purpose\
    \ systems that are linked to the\nsmart grid from cyberattacks. To verify the\
    \ integrity of the embedded software, a manu-\nfacturer’s key is needed. To provide\
    \ the solutions, the manufacturer’s software may need\nto be authentic, and the\
    \ company may need to implement risk management in order to\nlimit the damage\
    \ that may come from installing counterfeit programs [115]. An alternative\nto\
    \ utilizing the manufacturer’s key is to ensure that the program is authentic\
    \ and has not\nbeen illegally duplicated. Antivirus software is often used as\
    \ a ﬁrst line of defense when\nit comes to warding off malware. Threats may become\
    \ susceptible to malware through\nphishing assaults, but the antivirus software\
    \ must be up to date with the latest patch, and\nthe attacker must not discover\
    \ a means to evade the protection. Using a network intrusion\nprevention system\
    \ (NIPS), which can both restrict user access to a network and defend it\nfrom\
    \ cyberattacks, is the most efﬁcient and secure method for securing a smart grid.\
    \ In\naddition, the NIPS can keep an eye on intrusion data and respond to halt\
    \ an attack before\nit ever begins. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)\
    \ provide another option for\nsmart grid security by monitoring and analyzing\
    \ the network trafﬁc in order to identify\nand prevent network-based attacks [125].\n\
    4.3.5. Network Security\nVPNs allow users to increase their protection while connecting\
    \ to a public network\nthrough the Internet. Using public network infrastructure\
    \ puts sensitive information at risk,\nthus a virtual private network (VPN) employs\
    \ a number of security measures, including\nencryption, to safeguard data in transit.\
    \ Furthermore, virtual private networks (VPNs) are\nemployed for communication\
    \ since they provide a safe channel for data transfer. There\nare two distinct\
    \ VPNs, both of which provide advantages to businesses and their frequent\nEnergies\
    \ 2023, 16, 820\n20 of 29\ncustomers [126]. Remote access virtual private networks\
    \ (VPNs) allow users to connect\nto internal company networks through a public\
    \ network. After authenticating, users on\nmobile devices and desktop computers\
    \ will be able to access the VPN server. When the\ncredentials are right, the\
    \ authentication is able to conﬁrm access and provide access to the\nvirtual network’s\
    \ resources. An organization’s proprietary apps and data are among the\nresources\
    \ that are accessible solely inside the company. Connecting to a VPN gateway\n\
    allows users of the remote access VPN to perform their duties from any location.\
    \ Virtual\nprivate networking (VPN) between two sites is quite similar to VPN\
    \ access from a remote\nlocation. However, it often links the whole network in\
    \ a single spot, even if the networks\nthemselves are situated elsewhere; this\
    \ is helpful for a bigger company that has to safely\nshare its resources with\
    \ several outposts in different areas to serve its partner or client\nbusiness\
    \ [127].\n4.3.6. Risk and Maturity Assessments\nRecent years have seen the development\
    \ of a variety of ingenious methods for ef-\nﬁciently conducting cybersecurity\
    \ risk assessments and executing mitigations in exten-\nsive, sophisticated networks\
    \ and infrastructure where complete security audits cannot be\nperformed owing\
    \ to time and capacity constraints. Cyber defense triage is a technique\nproposed\
    \ by [128] that helps identify high-impact attack areas that need security solutions\n\
    immediately. Again, security holes and weak spots may be found and corrected if\
    \ a matu-\nrity assessment is performed, as suggested in [129]. This includes\
    \ risk assessment, which is\nonly one of several controls that can be reviewed.\n\
    4.3.7. IPS and IDS\nTechnologies for identifying and blocking intrusions in a\
    \ network include intrusion\nprevention systems (IPS) and intrusion detection\
    \ systems (IDS). An IPS is a kind of network\nprotection that can recognize and\
    \ stop certain attacks [130]. Intrusion prevention systems\nconstantly monitor\
    \ your network, recording any suspicious activity. An IPS alerts the\nsystem administrators\
    \ and they shut down the access points and set up the ﬁrewalls to\navoid further\
    \ assaults. It is possible to utilize an IPS to detect when workers or visitors\
    \ to a\nnetwork are breaking the regulations set out by the company. In contrast,\
    \ an IDS is just\ntasked with monitoring the network and alerting system administrators\
    \ to any suspicious\nactivity [131].\n5. Blockchain Implication for Cybersecurity\
    \ of Smart Grid Paradigm\nConsidering a more diverse and dispersed structure for\
    \ SG is necessary in light of\nthe urgent need to include renewable energy sources.\
    \ This goal has been accomplished\nwith the use of a DER and a decentralized power-generating\
    \ system [132]. However, this\nhas added further layers of complexity to the SG.\
    \ PMUs, smart meters, home automation\nsensors, remote terminal units, etc., are\
    \ only a few examples of the equipment that make up\na SG’s complex infrastructure,\
    \ which also includes devices from the generation, transmis-\nsion, distribution,\
    \ user, operation, marketing, and utility domains [133]. Maintaining the\nreliability\
    \ of this fantastic SG infrastructure needs constant vigilance. Different applications\n\
    are needed for a different set of communication tools and protocols. A wide area\
    \ network\n(WAN) serves as the backbone of the communication system (WAN). Local\
    \ area networks\n(LAN), home area networks (HAN), wireless sensor networks (WSN),\
    \ neighborhood area\nnetworks (NAN), etc. are a few examples of various forms\
    \ of communication networks.\nThe TCP/IP protocol suite is widely used for data\
    \ transmission over these communication\nnetworks. In short, TCP/IP is not a safe\
    \ protocol to use. As a result, the SG apps’ commu-\nnication network is very\
    \ susceptible to assault. Although a SG has adopted some basic\nsecurity measures,\
    \ such as a ﬁrewall, intrusion detection, encryption, and authentication, it\n\
    is still susceptible to a number of cyberattacks. In [134], the author provides\
    \ a thorough\noverview of the different detection techniques available for spotting\
    \ cases of erroneous\ndata injection.\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n21 of 29\nGenerally\
    \ speaking, a SG ﬁts the proﬁle of a cyber-physical system [135,136]. Cyberse-\n\
    curity is an essential factor that guarantees the three key properties of every\
    \ cyber-physical\nsystem: availability, conﬁdentiality, and integrity. As a property,\
    \ “availability” means\nthat all information may be accessed quickly and easily.\
    \ Depending on the severity of the\ncyberattack, availability may be hindered\
    \ by data blockage, data delay, data corruption,\nor data loss. Cyberattacks have\
    \ a signiﬁcant effect on the accessibility of SG apps. To\nprevent other parties\
    \ from gaining access to sensitive or private data, the system is said to\nhave\
    \ the quality of conﬁdentiality. The privacy and copyrights of a SG application\
    \ might\nbe jeopardized by a hack on conﬁdentially. Theft of password-related\
    \ information is one\nway that such accidents might allow unauthorized access\
    \ to the program, which can have\ncatastrophic effects on its functioning. To\
    \ prevent tampering, corruption, or deletion of\ndata, integrity is deﬁned as\
    \ the capacity of an application to prevent unwanted access to\nits storage system.\
    \ Information used to setup an application may be compromised by an\nassault on\
    \ its integrity, resulting in a catastrophic loss. The sensors, for instance,\
    \ may end\nup misconﬁgured due to the change data, which would then cause the\
    \ SG program to\nfail. Blockchain is an open, decentralized ledger that cannot\
    \ be altered once it has been\ncreated and does not need a trusted third party\
    \ to function. Because of this, blockchain is\nan essential component of SG apps\
    \ because it provides a safe means of transferring data.\nThe security of a SG\
    \ application may be fortiﬁed by using a blockchain to speciﬁcally coun-\nteract\
    \ threats. Due to the numerous types of participants and the diverse ways in which\n\
    agreement is reached, a public blockchain is the safest of the different types\
    \ of blockchains.\nMembers of the public blockchain may maintain their anonymity,\
    \ but only trustworthy\nnodes are allowed to participate in the consortium and\
    \ private blockchains. Proof of work\nis used as the consensus method in the public\
    \ blockchain, whereas multi-party voting\nand rigorously pre-approved nodes are\
    \ used in the consortium blockchain and private\nblockchain, respectively. However,\
    \ the processing cost of a public blockchain is quite high.\nTherefore, consortium\
    \ and private blockchains are preferred over public blockchains when\nsecurity\
    \ concerns are minimal and computational complexity is low.\nSmart devices create\
    \ data that are sent to the blockchain network server through the\nTCP/IP protocol.\
    \ The data may be hashed and encrypted at the device level, forming\nthe block\
    \ that can later be added to the blockchain network if the devices have sufﬁcient\n\
    processing capacity. This is the safest design since if the data are altered once\
    \ they leave\nthe devices, they will invalidate the block because of the update\
    \ in the hash function. This,\nhowever, places signiﬁcant computational strain\
    \ on the end nodes, which are often already\nperforming many simultaneous activities.\
    \ Another option is to use TCP/IP to transfer data\nto blockchain servers/nodes\
    \ and then construct blockchain blocks. Though less safe, it\nlacks the computing\
    \ capability of more advanced smart gadgets. The latter is where the use\nof private\
    \ and public keys for further authentication might be useful. Since all consortium\n\
    blockchain members are known and trustworthy, and the consensus method is centered\n\
    on multi-party consensus with no anonymity loopholes, this design intends to maximize\n\
    security. The administration and the management choose the nodes that will participate\
    \ in\nmining on the consortium and private blockchains.\n6. Challenges and Potential\
    \ Future Research Directions\nTo fully realize blockchain’s potential as a game-changing\
    \ component, a number\nof signiﬁcant issues related to scalability, computing\
    \ cost, security, and privacy need to\nbe resolved.\nScalability limitations:\
    \ The throughput, efﬁciency, and computing cost of existing\nblockchain systems\
    \ are all too often inadequate. Many blockchains now have long process-\ning times\
    \ for transactions to be put into the chain of previously veriﬁed blocks because\n\
    of limitations in block size. As a result, block time grows exponentially, degrading\
    \ the\nsystem’s efﬁciency. If every transaction is recorded in the distributed\
    \ ledger, it will grow\nto be enormous very quickly [137,138]. IoT data are massive\
    \ because of the complexity of\nIoT use cases, such as smart cities and eHealth.\
    \ As a result, the amount of data generated\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n22 of 29\n\
    by IoT devices will explode, making it difﬁcult for a blockchain to handle such\
    \ massive\ndata sets. As a result of these drawbacks, many app developers do not\
    \ consider blockchain\ntechnology to be a viable replacement for the status quo\
    \ in managing complex IoT net-\nworks [139–141]. High computational cost: As the\
    \ computational cost of a blockchain, the\nfee for executing a transaction was\
    \ published by Wood et al. [142]. There are several moving\nparts in the execution\
    \ of a transaction, such as creating robust security, mining, verifying,\nand\
    \ storing it across a distributed network of users [143]. Together, these procedures\
    \ need\na considerable amount of processing time. Some mining methods, such proof\
    \ of work\n(PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and practical Byzantine fault tolerance\
    \ (pBFT), need much\nmore power than others. To validate transactions, for example,\
    \ proof of work (PoW), the\nmost decentralized mining mechanism, involves solving\
    \ a complex mathematical problem.\nIoT systems struggle to match the resource\
    \ requirements of PoW for qualifying the most\ndecentralized nature because of\
    \ their limited resources. The complexity of a blockchain\nsystem will need substantial\
    \ technological and human resources, even for IoT devices\nwith reasonably high\
    \ processing capabilities. Concerns about high maintenance costs from\nconsumers\
    \ would be sparked, preventing the widespread use of blockchain-based services.\n\
    Security and privacy issue: Blockchain technology is resilient to DDoS, Sybil,\
    \ selﬁsh\nmining, and ransomware, but the current implementation has its own security\
    \ issues.\nBlockchain’s consensus mechanisms and the conﬁrmation of new transactions\
    \ are vulnera-\nble to manipulation by actors that control more than 50% of the\
    \ computers operating the\nblockchain. In Bitcoin parlance, this is known as a\
    \ 51% assault. Blockchains are vulnerable\nto data loss and network interruption\
    \ if their transactions are not closely monitored. Sybil\nattacks include malevolent\
    \ nodes creating many identities in order to deceive others by\nreporting incorrect\
    \ information or overwhelming the network with fraudulent transac-\ntions [144,145].\
    \ Distributed denial-of-service attacks is more challenging on a blockchain\n\
    network. However, DDoS assaults and similar message-stealing attacks are particularly\n\
    prevalent on blockchain networks [146]. DDoS attacks target monetary services,\
    \ including\nmining, electronic wallets, and cryptocurrency exchanges. Selﬁsh\
    \ mining is a technique\nused in bitcoin mining wherein a group of miners pool\
    \ their resources in order to maximize\ntheir revenue. In selﬁsh mining, a miner\
    \ (or group of miners) deliberately withholds\nor releases blocks from the network\
    \ to maximize their ﬁnancial gain [147–151]. Storing\nall types of health data\
    \ on a blockchain creates a delay in performing transactions and\nrisks data leakage\
    \ and revelation of patients’ sensitive information, despite the fact that\nblockchain\
    \ and IoT can facilitate secure data exchange.\nMore research into the construction\
    \ of a blockchain-based smart grid framework,\nincluding an IDS and DAPPS tailored\
    \ to smart grid applications, may be pursued using\nvarious architectural approaches.\
    \ Considering DDoS attacks, FDIA attacks, breaches, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks,\
    \ a testing framework for a blockchain-enabled smart grid may\nbe researched and\
    \ created. Multiple distributed blockchain networks may be combined\nto form the\
    \ blockchain network of the whole transmission system, a potential beneﬁt\nof\
    \ the distributed implementation of the blockchain with smart contract functions.\
    \ The\nability to monitor and regulate the transmission system in a decentralized,\
    \ cyber-secured\nenvironment can deal with the rising number of distributed generators\
    \ (DGs) and protect\nthe system’s functioning from a single point of failure.\
    \ A power grid, for instance, may\nbe partitioned into areas, each of which would\
    \ be monitored by a unique collection of\nICT devices enabled by the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) and equipped with smart contracts\ncontaining the governing\
    \ logic and algorithms. It is possible to designate one area as\nthe command center\
    \ and then create a system for invoking contracts across separated\nareas that\
    \ considers the time syncing of sensors and actuators. The distributed control\n\
    algorithm must provide individual subcontracts for regional generation and consumption\n\
    control. Additionally, sophisticated algorithms for cyber-protected RTU and IED\
    \ control\nin the smart grid may be built as part of blockchain-based smart contracts.\
    \ To regulate\nvoltage, tap changers in the electrical grid may be operated using\
    \ smart controls stored on\nthe blockchain.\nEnergies 2023, 16, 820\n23 of 29\n\
    7. Conclusions\nAs data storage and processing capabilities improve, so does SG.\
    \ Blockchain is one\nsuch innovation that has the ability to revolutionize a SG’s\
    \ internal ﬁnancial dealings. The\nblockchain may be used to authorize transactions\
    \ without a central authority since it is\na decentralized and secure system.\
    \ It has been underused for SG applications despite its\nenormous utility in other\
    \ ﬁelds. In this study, we looked at blockchain technology from\nthe point of\
    \ view of its potential usefulness in SG settings. Important SG applications\n\
    were outlined, along with suggested general structures and highlighted obstacles.\
    \ The\nanalysis could help researchers focus their efforts on creating unique\
    \ technologies that can\nhandle the demands of real-world SG applications. From\
    \ many vantage points, blockchain-\nbased technologies are still in their infancy\
    \ and represent unsolved research questions\nfor the future. Many SG apps run\
    \ in real time, and the blockchain should not slow\nthem down. Computing demands\
    \ place a heavy burden on the resources available in\nblockchain-based systems.\
    \ Blockchain technology has to be optimized to run on less\nresource-intensive\
    \ frameworks without sacriﬁcing security. To make this technology widely\nused\
    \ and interoperable, regulators will need to establish standardized processes.\
    \ Future\nstudy into some of these questions has the potential to alter the landscape\
    \ of blockchain-\nbased systems radically.\nCompetency- and productivity-wise,\
    \ smart grids outperform their historical coun-\nterparts because they are more\
    \ secure, employ more renewable energy sources, enhance\nenergy management efﬁciency,\
    \ lower consumers’ electricity bills, and cut down on green-\nhouse gas emissions\
    \ and reduce their environmental impact. Yet, another internet-wide\ncybersecurity\
    \ risk will be introduced by this novel system. As the conventional power grid\n\
    increasingly relies on private networks that do not need a major cybersecurity\
    \ concern,\nthe importance of cybersecurity in the power sector grows. As a result,\
    \ cybersecurity in\nsmart grid is an emerging area of study that is gaining traction\
    \ in both the academic circles\nand the business world. While several papers have\
    \ discussed the security advantages\nand vulnerabilities of smart grids in their\
    \ study, almost all of them have concluded that\na denial-of-service attack is\
    \ the greatest danger to smart grid that makes it vulnerable to\nnetwork attacks,\
    \ which would effectively shut down the whole grid.\nThis article provides an\
    \ overview and discussion of cybersecurity in the smart grid\ncontext. Several\
    \ signiﬁcant cyberattack models have been given, along with defensive\nstrategies\
    \ to counteract them. This study also considers potential smart grid-related dif-\n\
    ﬁculties. The complexity of smart grids arises from the wide range of devices\
    \ that must\ncommunicate over an extensive network coverage. The most challenging\
    \ part of securing\nthese devices is to protect them against cyberattacks over\
    \ large geographical networks.\nFinally, computer network protocols must be updated\
    \ to reﬂect the current communication\nstate to provide complex encryption techniques\
    \ and offer security countermeasures. As a\nresult, it will protect us from more\
    \ sophisticated cyber threats.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.W.\

    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, were first developed
    for military use. During World War I in the early 1900s, UAVs were modernized.
    UAVs are more akin to remote pilot control, with a limited range of operation.
    This trait drew the attention of the military industry in later days [1]. Later,
    this technology found its place in many real-time applications such as agriculture,
    healthcare, transportation, package delivery, and many more. The authors in [2]
    discussed the importance of UAVs in the agricultural domain under some specific
    tasks such as precision farming, monitoring irrigation systems, and surveilling
    land from the sky (i.e., sky-farming). Due to its broader application in-scope,
    UAV technology is seen as a potential asset that could contribute in to many domains.
    Pathak et al. [3] highlighted the role of UAVs in the industries like gas and
    oil make use of UAVs for leakage detection and long-distance aerial supervision
    of the sites. UAVs also play a role in civil construction sites for work status
    monitoring and inspection. In mining, drones are used for aerial photography and
    3D mine mapping. In this pandemic world, drones are beneficial in healthcare delivery
    (which is contactless) and ensure the safety [4]. UAVs can also be used in medical
    labs services for specimen delivery and lab monitoring. Even in the supply chain,
    UAVs are used these days for intelligent deliveries in logistics for fast, timely,
    and cost-effective deliveries. The aforementioned applications of UAVs have automated
    the workflow of these industries in a cost-effective and time-saving fashion.
    UAVs are gaining a lot of popularity and has made their mark in the global market.
    FIGURE 1 shows the current progression in the market size of UAVs across the world.
    The current market(2021) of drones across the world is 13.9 billion. The upward
    direction of the bars in the graph reveals the demand for UAVs. Drones are making
    billion dollars market in India. As increasing UAV consumption, the data it carries
    becomes the nucleus for cyberattacks [5]. As a result, UAVs are very much assailable
    towards malicious activities. This is a severe problem that needs to be addressed
    so that mankind can cherish this luxury. FIGURE 1. Market size of drones across
    the world [6]. Show All Authors in [7] discussed how attackers find UAVs easy
    prey to catch by tampering their communication with the distant UAVs along with
    its communication center. A UAV communicating with other UAVs over a wireless
    communication channel is highly susceptible to various security attacks such as
    data modification, denial of service, snooping, dispatch system, ADS-B, man-in-the-middle,
    and WiFi attacks. The aforementioned attacks on UAVs come from the type of communication
    and cryptographic protocols a drone system architecture uses. UAVs uses various
    communication protocols to accomplish the triumphant flight of a drone. Different
    global wireless communication standards have been used for UAVs viz 3G, 4G, 5G,
    and 6G. Early 2000 was the 3G era, whose communication latency was 100-500ms.
    The successor of 3G network is 4G, which gained its popularity in 2009 with a
    latency of less than 10ms. Then, 5G networks came in 2020 whose latency is less
    than 5ms. The reliability of these standards is in the decreasing order of their
    evolution. The important aspect of any UAV communication lies in the latency of
    the network, which is a round-trip time. Many sensitive applications such as military,
    intelligent transportation systems, and healthcare require a low latency network.
    The 5G and 6G networks are very much suitable for such applications. The are some
    other applications where a slight delay is acceptable in applications such as
    aerial photography, agriculture, site inspection etc. Various cryptography protocols
    have been used to secure UAV communication. The articles [8], [9] have discussed
    the cryptography techniques used to establish a successful UAV communication.
    FIGURE 2 shows various techniques that ensure secure communication between UAVs.
    It mentions symmetric and asymmetric key exchange protocols to secure UAV communication.
    In asymmetric key cryptography, two keys are used to encrypt the information passed,
    whereas, in symmetric key cryptography, only one key is used for secure data exchange.
    Security in the communication layer can also be accomplished by securing the physical
    layer of the UAV. FIGURE 2. Various techniques to secure UAV communication [8],
    [9]. Show All In order to prevent the attacks on any particular communication
    channel, various methods have been proposed. Machine learning algorithms, for
    example, can be used to detect harmful and intrusive network activity. Learning-based
    intrusion detection makes use of machine learning algorithms. These algorithms
    detect the intrusion by recognizing a pattern in the network, such as K-means
    clustering and SVM. Rule-based intrusion detection involves the rules which are
    pre-defined by the system. These rules are coded in the chip of the UAV and a
    cut-off threshold for each rule has to be followed strictly. These traditional
    cryptographic techniques are based on tiring mathematical computations. Hence,
    the complexity of these algorithms is exponential. The time taken for encryption
    and decryption thus increases. Another such concept of securing the communication
    is the blockchain environment. Blockchain-based system in UAV communication can
    potentially be used to address security concerns in the distribution of critical
    information. Blockchain creates a decentralised environment that encourages data
    security, transparency, and trust [9]. It keeps various copies of the same data
    on each node present in the network and its consensus protocols ensure data integrity.
    It prevents malicious activities from taking place in the communication environment.
    Despite the aforementioned benefits, the blockchain has its own lacunae. The time
    to mine a block in the blockchain environment is costly in terms of resource and
    energy consumption. These existing paradigms on securing UAV communication are
    not congenial to some of the fragile applications of UAV in which there is always
    curtailment of time, such as military operations where UAVs have to take immediate
    decisions. Thus we need a better solution to make UAV communication fast and secure
    at the same time. The aforementioned solutions to solve the UAV security and networking
    are not feasible when we want to manoeuvre the UAV technology in sensitive domains.
    To solve these issues, in this study, we propose a novel architecture based on
    quantum cryptography, which is much faster, secure, trusted, and reliable than
    classical cryptography. A. Scope of the Survey The authors in [10] have proposed
    the BHEALTH, a blockchain- based architecture to secure UAV-based healthcare systems.
    Then, Aggarwal et al. [11] presented a blockchain-based Healthcare 4.0 architecture
    with UAV Path Planning. The proposed architecture provides a secure data transmission
    and safeguarding sensitive healthcare data from cyber-attacks. Then, Haque et
    al. [12] suggested a new cybersecurity paradigm for UAVs that would allow for
    safe and secure data transfer. A system that ensures data security and confidentiality.
    The data was encrypted using Steganography methods. Zhu et al. [13] presented
    the analysis of the implementation of blockchain in military domain. Then, Alladi
    et al. [14] presented a review article by thoroughly investigating the use of
    blockchain in UAV communication to achieve high security and trust. Then, kumari
    et al. [15] proposed a blockchain and SDN-based secure UAV architecture to combat
    cyber-attacks. The proposed work was designed to secure and scale the UAV network.
    The findings of a quantitative assessment of crops using UAVs were given by Neji
    et al. [16]. For communication security, algorithms such as Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
    (RSA), secure hash algorithm (SHA), and others are utilized. Table 2 shows the
    comparative analysis of various existing state-of-the-art techniques for secure
    UAV communications. TABLE 1 List of Abbreviations TABLE 2 Comparative Analysis
    of Various Existing State-of-the-Art Techniques for Secure UAV Communications
    B. Motivation The sudden surge in the drone market has given birth to various
    research opportunities in which academicians and scientists can invest their time.
    The application areas where the drones can be deployed has been identified and
    hence these small power-constraint IoT devices are becoming popular with time.
    Potential drones can help automate and regulate the industry with their unique
    features. Following are the key points that motivated this research work to develop
    a proof of concept further: Drones are flexible enough to capture essential data
    at extreme locations, such as understanding volcano eruptions, surveillance of
    the chemical pipeline. The safe communication and operability of UAVs have been
    a primary concern till now. The scenario can go worst in the case of mission-critical
    applications such as military, healthcare and intelligent transportation where
    drones are deployed and data captures by them is of utmost importance. Major development
    and research in the domain of power-constraint IoT devices expose them to security
    and privacy issues. The need of the hour is to protect the communication in the
    best possible way. The quest to use the best technology for UAVs data transfer
    made this study develop a novel architecture that can allow the UAV information
    transmission to be more safeguarded. C. Research Contributions Following are the
    major research contributions of the paper: To scrutinize various security issues
    and vulnerabilities in the existing cryptographic and blockchain-based solutions
    for UAV communications. We propose a quantum cryptography-based UAV communication
    system to overcome security issues in the traditional UAV communication system.
    We present a case study on battlefield application to validate the proposed system.
    Also, the performance of the proposed application in the case study is evaluated
    by considering latency and throughput parameters. D. Organization Rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background concepts of
    UAVs and quantum cryptography. Section 3 presents the detailed description on
    the integration of UAVs and quantum cryptography. Section 4 present the proposed
    quantum cryptography-based solution for UAV communication. Section 5 discusses
    the case study of the proposed system in the battlefield application. Section
    6 discusses the open issues and challenges. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
    Table 1 depicts the abbreviations and its explanation used in the paper. SECTION
    II. Background Concepts In this section, we briefly discuss various fundamental
    concepts of UAVs and its applications, quantum cryptography, and blockchain technology.
    A. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: Application and Security Perspective UAVs also called
    drones, have grown significantly in recent years. They are widely used in various
    military and civilian applications. The UAV military market is expected to hit
    26.11 billion USD by 2028 [20]. Numerous studies have revealed that shortly the
    consumption of UAVs for public purposes can be more than military purposes, ultimately
    overcoming the need for war in the future. A UAV is a self-contained or remote-controlled
    vehicle. Two different methods can control a UAV: (i) self-control or (ii) ground
    control channel (GCS). In recent years, the increase in research and development
    in UAVs has improved its usage functionalities. The widespread use and safety
    of UAVs have made them possible an attractive target for hackers and attackers.
    As the technology progresses, there exists a few security solutions for UAV communication.
    Most of these solutions are just suggestions or at the beginning of their development
    process. 1) Application Scenarios of UAVs This section discovers various distinct
    scenarios where UAVs can be used to generate useful data and the same data can
    be used for further meaningful analysis and smart real-time decision-making process.
    Table 3 describes the summary of various real-time UAV application scenarios,
    such as healthcare, volcano monitoring, agriculture, etc. TABLE 3 Summary of Selected
    Real-Time UAV Application Scenarios 2) Security Issues in UAVs UAVs and GCS generally
    communicate through communication protocols, such as MAVLink, UranusLink, UAVCAN
    [31]. These protocols are used to transfer messages during communication from
    GCS. Most of the existing security protocols may not be intended for such an environment.
    Either they do not make good use of resources, or use these communication systems
    do not offer safety measures. Among these processes, MAVLink is a common and the
    most widely used for communication between GCS and UAVs. However, there is no
    hidden way to secure lightweight protocols. While working with any digital system,
    security is a significant issue. Because of the unmanned nature of the UAV and
    remote wireless communication, security is even more of a worry. If attackers
    acquire control of the flying cellular base stations, the concerned UAVs are more
    likely to lose their communication paths. They may also experience significant
    interference concerns while using line-of-sight (LOS) links [32]. So, the security
    of UAV communication is of prime concern in the presence of the open wireless
    communication channel. UAVs are highly vulnerable to various cyber-attacks, with
    the attacker’s aim to compromise the integrity and privacy of the UAV infrastructure
    as well as data. Eavesdropping and keylogging attacks pose a hazard to data in
    communication between UAV and GCS, threatening the information’s privacy. Thus,
    the lack of effective communication and encryption standards, resulting in unauthorized
    access to private information. Keyloggers are the software that record information
    entered into a keyboard and was initially designed to monitor children’s activities,
    track sensitive data entered by employees, and track criminals [33]. Keyloggers
    are increasingly being utilized to steal data. Either in ATMs, where keyboard
    sniffers can recover pins or in UAVs, where the privacy of information transferred
    between numerous UAVs is compromised. Antivirus software cannot identify keyloggers,
    and they can access your data remotely over the Internet. Eavesdropping, as the
    word means, is the act of listening to transmissions without permission and can
    be used to control communications between numerous UAVs. Deauthentication, GPS
    spoofing [34], and message injection attacks also pose a risk of modifying exchanged
    data and trying to take control of the UAV and its communication mechanism, resulting
    in causalities. The GPS navigation system, based on satellites, provides users
    with information about traffic positioning and location. False GPS signals are
    sent by high-power devices in GPS spoofing, resulting in nodes accepting false
    GPS signals instead of authentic signals. It’s dangerous because it can cause
    UAV nodes to be captured, crash, or collide with one another. Message injections
    are the injection of pseudo-legitimate messages with a structure similar to that
    of a legitimate message. These messages trick the aircraft or the ground station
    machine into thinking it is a real plane. Message deletion and modification can
    also be used to make fake messages appear to be authentic. Management packets
    are needed to authenticate UAV and GCS and create a communication link between
    them. These packets are modified by sending de-authentication frames to both,
    effectively disconnecting their communication and allowing the attacker to take
    control of either UAV or GCS. B. Quantum Cryptography Quantum cryptography is
    a technique of cryptographic operations that makes use of the quantum mechanical
    phenomenon. Quantum key distribution was a perfect quantum cryptography system
    that solved the exchange key problem with safe data. It is not allowed to copy
    data contained in quantum mode, for example. Quantum states can be altered if
    the entered data is attempted to read because of the function’s reduced quality.
    This may be used to identify audio declines in quantum key distribution. Gilles
    Brassard and Steven Wiesner [35] have worked on the creation of the quantum key
    distributions. Wiesner invented the theory of quantum conjugate coding, you Pareira
    College, Columbia University, New York, in the 1970s. The Society for developing
    the theory, i.e., IEEE rejected their extensive study on conjugate coding, but
    it was published in SIGACT Journal in 1983. Bennett and Brassard created the BB84
    [36], a soon dynamic communication device in 1984 based on their earlier work.
    In a 1991 work by Arthur Eckert [37], for a more extensive description of quantum
    cryptography, David Deutsch’s strategy to produce a safe key distribution combining
    quantum mechanics, non-locality, and Bell inequalities is based on the confusion,
    ships for free in the darkness. The study of executing security tasks using concepts
    of quantum-mechanics is known as cryptography. Quantum cryptography [35], which
    uses quantum key distribution, is the most widely used because it gives an information-theoretically
    safe solution to the underlying exchange difficulties. Copying the label information
    of a quantum state, for example, is challenging. Quantum cryptography also offers
    the advantage of allowing you to do cryptographic tasks that are either stated
    or considered to be impossible to complete using merely regular communication.
    We discuss various quantum cryptographic concepts in this subsection structurally
    presented in FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Diverse concepts of quantum cryptography [38].
    Show All 1) Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) It is an advanced quantum cryptography
    scheme that establishes a public key between two parties by utilizing a quantum
    communication without a third party learning anything about the key. If the third
    party or eavesdropper attempts to learn more about the key that Alice and Bob
    observe being put up, the quantum states getting transmitted over a channel might
    be disrupted and the two parties communicating will be able to detect the intervention.
    After the keys were already established, they can frequently be used to secure
    the connection traditionally. For example, the transmitted key can be used for
    compatible cryptography (e.g. one-time pad) [39]. The security of quantum key
    deployment may be demonstrated conceptually with eavesdropper activities getting
    traced on the way, which is not possible with the traditional key distribution.
    While some fundamental assumptions are required, such as that quantum physics
    is valid and that Alice and Bob may trust one another, Eve should not be able
    to impersonate Alice or Bob since a man-in-the-middle attack is possible. 2) Mistrustful
    Quantum Cryptography Participants of mistrustful cryptography have little trust
    in one another. When both participants, i.e., Alice and Bob, offer private inputs,
    for example, work to complete a survey. Alice, on either hand, has little faith
    in Bob, and Bob has little faith in Alice. As a result, securing cryptographic
    work necessitates Alice’s confirmation that Bob did not cheat after the computation
    was performed, as well as Bob’s confirmation that Alice did not cheat. Mistrustful
    cryptographic processes include commitment systems and secure accounting, including
    money procedures and unforgettable transfers. Quantum coin flipping: The process
    of quantum money laundering involves two persons who do not trust each other.
    The quantum channel was used to communicate and information was transmitted via
    quantum transmission. When compared to regular communication techniques, quantum
    communications have been proved to have significant security benefits [36]. In
    certain cases, a coin flip protocol looks like this: Alice selects a base-like
    diagonal and creates a string of photons on that basis to deliver to Bob. Bob
    picks a rectangular or diagonal base to evaluate each photon at random, noting
    the base he used for the recorded value. Bob makes a public guess about the foundation
    on which Alice sent her qubits. Alice reveals her choice of basis and sends Bob
    her original string. Bob validates Alice’s string by comparing it to his table.
    Quantum commitment: It is a paradigm where a user agrees on a value with the facility
    to reveal it later. These schemes were invented to make sure that the committed
    statement or values do not mutate over time viz a party committing on a value
    shall not change it one committed. Commitment mechanisms are frequently included
    in cryptographic agreements. Mayers has demonstrated that quantum commitment is
    impossible (without conditions) [40]. An unlimited computer attacker can defeat
    any quantum commitment scheme. On the other side, Kilian has demonstrated that
    anonymous transmission may be utilized to create practically any distributed computer
    that is safe and the findings of Crepeau and Kilian do not imply that the commitment
    and quantum channels can be used to produce a secure calculation of multiple groups
    [41]. 3) Position-Based Quantum Cryptography Position-based quantum cryptography
    aims to focus entirely on the player’s location for verification. Among opposing
    enemies, position verification using traditional protocols is impossible. In 2010,
    the concept of exploiting quantum effects in spatial validation was first published
    in the research literature. It is claimed that quantum processes can be unconditionally
    validated locally due to the combination of force and time. It has links to a
    Quantum Teleportation Protocol that is based on ports [38]. 4) Device-Independent
    Quantum Cryptography Device-independent quantum cryptography is necessary to assess
    the situations in which the devices are faulty or hostile while evaluating the
    security of such an agreement. Mayers and Yao proposed that quantum protocols
    be created by hiring quantum “self-testing” devices. Given the fact that the Bell
    test devices are “very noisy,” some difficulties have been found to allow the
    device to be insecure and identity [42]. 5) Bounded- and Noisy-Quantum-Storage
    Model (BQSM) BQSM will be used to build commitment and unforgettable transfer
    procedures. The logical assumption is that the enemy’s quantum memory is finite.
    In the final sound idea, the opponent can make use of quantum storage devices
    with issues of any size. In this sense, trusted groups should also utilize a lot
    of RAM. As a result, these techniques are insufficient until it comes to overcoming
    true memory obstacles. In the old situation, the same result may be reached by
    restricting the quantity of old (non-value) data that the opponent can maintain
    [38]. Based on the above discussed quantum cryptography facts and procedures,
    below mentioned are its potential benefits: It revolutionizes secure communication
    by relying on basic physical principles rather than mathematical methods or current
    computer technology to provide security. It’s completely impenetrable. It’s quite
    easy to use. It requires fewer resources to keep it running. In QKD, it is used
    to detect eavesdropping. This is useful because it means that data contained in
    the quantum state could be copied. If someone tries to decode such encoded data,
    the quantum state will change. Such cryptographic systems are always improving
    in terms of performance. As a result, it has been quickly adopted for encrypting
    the government’s and companies’ most valuable secrets. C. Origin and Timeline
    of Cryptography FIGURE 4 shows the timeline of cryptography techniques from spartan
    scytale to quantum. Cryptography was born around 400 BC, and from then, it descended
    and evolved by making itself stronger following the human need for secure communications.
    The timeline started from steganography, whose major ambition was to mask the
    “message” into something that is not visible to the beholder. With the desire
    to procure higher security, the concept of ciphers came into the picture where
    the target message to be sent is encoded and then decoded at the other end (the
    receiver). The distinct ciphers were invented over a long time until the first
    generation of computers arrived. The involvement of computers induced a new branch
    of computer science known as cybersecurity. Various algorithms were proposed to
    secure the data that were implemented on the computers. These algorithms exploited
    the concepts of mathematics and provided a wide range of protection against the
    various types of interference in the field of communication. The early algorithms
    such as DES and AES were proved to be tamper-proof and they are still used in
    various applications where encryption is required. The realm of encryption was
    preceded by blockchain technology, where data security and trust became the significant
    pillars of its foundation. As per the timeline, the technology to execute message
    encipher has been improved and advanced by many researchers. FIGURE 4. Timeline
    of quantum cryptography. Show All The progression of the computer hardware always
    lead to the improvisation of reliable and safe algorithms which can be implemented
    on them. One such advancement has left behind the traditional cryptography and
    blockchain technology. The development of quantum computers has opened opportunities
    for the researchers to make use of quantum physics rather than plain mathematics
    to accomplish the protect the data in case of sensitive application. The possible
    attacks on both traditional and blockchain based cryptography makes it ill-protected
    in the real world. Hence quantum cryptography comes into the scene which is way
    more secure than all the approaches proposed so far. The exploitation of the quantum
    properties such as entanglement and superpositon makes it a perfect candidate
    for the security purposes. The latest works in the field of quantum cryptography
    are still in its growing stage and can be seen as the future of the cryptography.
    D. Edge Over Traditional Cryptography This section describes benefits of quantum
    cryptography over the traditional cryptography schemes. 1) Fundamental Aspects
    According to the rules, any traditional private channel can be seen anonymously
    without the sender or recipient knowing of such hearing. Traditional physics is
    the study of macroscopic associations and objects, such as radio transmissions.
    It allows the measurement of a single physical attribute of an item without impacting
    other qualities. The embedded physical symbols of an item or signal contain data
    entered as a cryptographic key. As a result, using traditional cryptography, passive
    monitoring is a serious possibility. All things are supposed to be directed by
    quantum theory, which is the foundation of quantum cryptography; however, its
    effects are usually negative. Single atoms or subatomic particles, such as small
    systems, can be seen. Traditional cryptography needs the usage of longer keys
    frequently. Power consumption doubles every 18 months, as does the cost of computing.
    Moore’s law asserts that computing speed decreases with time [43]. 2) Commercial
    Aspects In Commercial aspects, the organizations have sensitive data that they
    want to protect in the long run and that are attractive targets for hackers they
    use symmetric algorithms with long key lengths like AES and DES as possible and
    use perfect forward secrecy techniques to minimize the amount of data protected
    under each key when Diffie-Hellman is used to negotiate symmetric keys. For this
    reason, they should also consider making the switch to quantum-resistant algorithms
    as soon as possible because such algorithms are still in their infancy, it is
    best to start with hybrid algorithms. There are commercial quantum computing solutions
    available. However, they are only suitable for point-to-point connections. On
    the other hand, older cryptography may be employed in software for a cheaper cost
    to clients. In addition, a cryptographic system based on classical cryptography
    can be applied to a small hardware object such as a smart card. In contrast, the
    quantum cryptography that descends to that level requires much more research [43].
    3) Application Aspects The digital signatures verify the digital data’s authenticity
    and certify that a known sender has transmitted a message and is too without modification.
    Key generation, signing, and key verification are the three significant algorithms
    used by many applications, which are notoriously difficult to implement in quality
    control. As a result, quantum cryptography lacks numerous key capabilities, such
    as digital signatures and verified email [43]. 4) Technological Aspects In the
    area of quantum communication (teleportation), or “fast transmission technology,”
    Chinese scientists have accomplished the farthest distance. In partnership with
    China University of Technology and Tsinghua University, the Hefei National Laboratory
    conducted free space communication tests that successfully raised the communication
    distance to 9 miles [43]. Traditional cryptography, on the other hand, may be
    used to communicate over millions of kilometres. According to recent research,
    Toshiba has achieved a new recording rate for quantum key distribution, namely
    1 Mbit / s on average [43]. On the other hand, traditional encryption is constrained
    by the amount of energy it consumes. 5) Other Aspects The communication channel
    is not compatible with traditional online writing because security is defined
    only by computer complexity. As a result, a secure connection is not required.
    Quantum cryptography connections, on the other hand, necessitate quantum routes
    such as fiber or air (wireless), and there is always the possibility of photon
    polarisation conversion owing to the Birefringence effect or negative consequences,
    such as changes in refractive index caused by damage [43]. Additionally, an old
    n-bit register can only hold one n-bit thread at a time. The quantum n-qbit register
    can maintain at any time the height of all 2pow(n) n-bit cables. E. Edge Over
    Blockchain Technology Technology nowadays is based on other technologies. For
    example, the critical application in IoT like healthcare, transportation system,
    and surveillance is dependent on analysis results of Artificial Intelligence /
    Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms. Blockchain offers the participating members
    security and trust, but it still uses traditional cryptographic schemes such as
    digital signatures and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) 256 algorithms. This encourages
    almost all organizations to deploy it. According to Deloitte, more than 84% of
    businesses believe blockchain will provide superior security than traditional
    IT systems [44]. Due to conventional cryptographic algorithms, the data within
    the blockchain is still breachable and vulnerable to security attacks. 1) Blockchain
    Security Weakness Blockchain is based on the concept of interconnected nodes that
    can collaborate to make crucial decisions. It uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-256
    and digital signature algorithms. These paradigms make use of one-way mathematical
    functions, which are difficult to trace back (or decrypt). These algorithms are
    inherently traditional and are vulnerable to various attacks. Blockchain proposes
    an architecture where immutability and multiple data copies are available. It
    allows the data to remain at its place for eternity. This makes the data availability
    100% and hence more prone to attackers. Therefore, the blockchain-based protection
    to data over sensitive channels is therefore doubtful and this issue can be addressed
    by quantum cryptography. With the use of Shor’s algorithm, it is possible to break
    the public key cryptography. Quantum cryptography does not make use of traditional
    mathematical one-way functions for security purposes, but rather it is based on
    the concepts of quantum physics. The prepare and measure-based quantum encryption
    can be used to prevent and detect the intrusion of the attacker. The quantum states
    are responsible for storing the sensitive information, which when can be extracted
    right after the measurement of that particular quantum state and the state is
    destroyed upon measurement [21]. This ensures the integrity of the information
    and serves better than the blockchain ideology. F. Quantum Cryptography Applications
    This section briefly elucidates the applications in real world where quantum cryptography
    can be applied and utilized. Following is a list of few such applications: Quantum
    cryptography in UAV communication: The sudden rise in drone usage due to its mobility
    benefit has opened a research area where drone to drone and drone to ground station
    communication has to be secured using cryptography. Traditional cryptography has
    its own limitations where they fail to secure communication. Quantum cryptography
    herein can deliver better. To cater the applications where data capture by a drone
    is an utmost important resource, quantum cryptography must be enforced. Quantum
    Cryptography in Cloud Computing: As many users are using cloud platforms for data
    storage and processing for deploying large-scale applications. The purpose of
    new security for the cloud which uses the benefits of current protocols like Kerberos
    and the security advantages of Quantum Cryptography. Since everyday hackers are
    trying to hack powerful security like Apple and Dropbox for data transit in some
    of the applications occurs via a traditional network, storage on the same server
    for several users and malicious programmers have made a breakthrough, So cloud
    security has become a major concern [45]. Quantum Cryptography in Voting Security:
    Quantum cryptography was used to secure the Swiss Election from hackers and unintentional
    data modification. The Federal Election in the State of Geneva takes place in
    October 2007, with communication from every data entry center—here, the paper
    votes are keyed into the computer. The data was protected by connecting to the
    state government’s central data repository in Geneva through a quantum link. The
    fundamental goal, according to Geneva state chancellor Robert Hensler, is to make
    sure that the data is not compromised between entry and storage [46]. Quantum
    cryptography in future E-commerce: In future E-commerce, suppose the seller and
    customer and have finalized a deal over shopping mall under some constraints and
    sending messages to each other using quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum
    secure direct communication (QSDC) theories in E-commerce applications. Using
    quantum cryptography protocol ignores the test qubits for simplification, but
    some testing methods are similar to BB84. Customers and sellers encode the messages
    by quantum techniques and send the encoded qubit to Online shopping malls. Then
    online shopping mall measures the entangled qubit pair and publishes the measurement
    outcomes. So, now a customer and seller have completed their agreement [47]. Quantum
    cryptography in encrypted video call: Wired published a blog post in January 2018
    on a symposium hosted by Chinese and Australian researchers on quantum encrypted
    video-call. For the first time, the researchers are confident in their ability
    to conduct a teleconference. They tested quantum communications between satellites
    and ground stations for months before the teleconference. They launched a conference
    call, and it was determined that two people could talk for 75 minutes through
    a quantum link that is secure enough to interact [48]. Quantum cryptography in
    smart card: The most excellent approach to secure transactions and electronic
    communication is through overly complicated mathematics. Los Alamos National Laboratory
    created the QKarD and patented in 2010-11. This is ground-breaking technology.
    Instead of complex mathematical problems, the QKarD implements mechanical physics
    principles to encrypt the message/information. The applications of QKarD are telecommunications,
    banking, and financial transactions, wireless Internet, electronic voting facility,
    and vehicle access and information exchange for government/defense. The benefits
    are Compact, Wireless, Portable, Low-cost development, Doesn’t require dedicated
    fiber optics, and is invulnerable to both conventional and quantum computer attacks
    [49]. SECTION III. Integration of UAVs and Quantum Cryptography There are many
    cyber attacks possible in UAVs. i.e password theft, man in the middle (MITM),
    denial of service (DoS), GPS Jamming, Spoofing, open Wi-Fi, etc. An attack on
    the drone can be possible in diverse ways. A few instances are password theft,
    brute-force assaults, and mathematical attacks. MITM obtains access to sensitive
    information without the user’s knowledge or agreement by controlling the communication
    between the two parties. In GPS spoofing, an attacker sends false messages about
    the drone’s flight path. The data transfer at a high rate of speed will be limited
    by the de-authentication software. So, the novel solution for UAV cyber attacks
    can be achieved by the quantum cryptography technique. It uses quantum physics
    properties to secure UAV communication. Quantum computers are based on superposition
    and entanglement properties to process transactions at a higher speed than traditional
    computers and also use significantly less power. A. Quantum Entanglement Quantum
    entanglement is a feature observed at the subatomic level in which entangled particles
    remain connected (in certain way) so that actions performed on one particle impact
    the other, regardless of their distance. Quantum entanglement is a property of
    quantum physics. It is the foundation of the interaction gap that exists from
    traditional and quantum mechanics methods. In some situations, physical characteristics
    like location, pressure, spin, and segmentation measured by trapped particles
    may be proven to be fully integrated. When zero spins produce reduced particles
    and one rotates clockwise in the first axis, the rotation of the second particle
    measured along the same axis opposes the clock’s motion. When we’re talking about
    entangled particles, a measurement might affect the entire system. However, studies
    have discovered that the polarization or spins of entangled particles at different
    locations statistically violating Bell’s inequalities, confirming quantum mechanics
    paradoxical predictions. It was impossible to exclude the findings in one episode
    that were transparently redirected to the region, and the results are in for the
    second portion of the term in previous tests. The pieces were far enough apart
    to draw a link with the speed of light, but there’s a lot additionally one example,
    it might be worth 10,000 times longer than the interval between the measurements.
    Quantum entanglement was shown using photons, neutrinos, electrons, buckyball
    molecules, and even tiny diamonds. A current subject in research and innovation
    in applications to participate in a relationship, computing, and quantum radar.
    B. Quantum Superposition The fundamental concept of quantum theory is Quantum
    Superposition. It argues that any two (or more) valid quantum states may be combined
    (“superposed”) to generate another valid quantum state. It is similar to how waves
    function in conventional physics and that each quantum state may be represented
    as the sum of two or more distinct unique states. It is a quantum conceptual qubit
    state corresponding to a superposition of 0 and 1, the fundamental positions in
    quantum computation. The quantum state is always 0 in Dirac notation, which has
    been improved in classical logic by measurement. The first condition is true all
    of the time. Unlike conventional bits, a qubit may be in both modes simultaneously
    and can only be in one of the states: 0 or 1. As a result, detecting whether a
    qubit is 0 or 1 is rarely 0.0-1.0, and measurements on the identical qubits do
    not always provide the same result. Hence, these two properties or features of
    Quantum Computing are better than classical cryptography. That’s why we are using
    these properties. SECTION IV. The Proposed Quantum Cryptography-Based Solution
    This section describes the proposed quantum cryptography-based architecture to
    secure UAV communications. We propose a novel layered architecture that makes
    the UAV communication indestructible based on quantum cryptography. Figure 5 shows
    the layered proposed architecture comprises of control layer, Internet layer,
    quantum security layer, physical/UAV layer, and monitoring layer. The detailed
    description of each layer is mentioned in the following subsections. FIGURE 5.
    The proposed layered architecture. Show All A. Monitoring Layer This layer solely
    focus on capturing the data from various desired locations. Here the locations
    are considered as entities for example L 1 (City), L 2 (Water body), L 3 (Forest
    area), L 4 (border between two areas) and many more s.t. { L 1 , L 2 , L 3 , …,
    L X } ∈  L all . Any L a  ∈  L all , where ‘a’ is any arbitrary whole number is
    capable of producing a huge amount of data which can possess various properties
    such as variety, volume, and velocity. The data generated here can be image or
    stream of images (i.e., videos). The frequency with which the data is generated
    in any location L a ∈ L all totally depends on the specific location. For example,
    a data which is borderline specific ( L 4 ) can generate the data containing the
    happenings across the borderline, L 3 can generate data in line with the occurrences
    of any disaster happening across the dense forest area in which the monitoring
    is required.Hence, this layer is responsible mainly for data generation from any
    given environment, as per the application requirement. The monitoring layer performs
    all the ground work which is very much difficult if performed manually by humans.
    Monitoring layer make use of a UAV cameras to capture all the relevant data for
    further analysis. The monitoring layer works with the following equations. a,X>
    L all ≠ 0,a<X NULL, L X ∈ L all (1) (2) View Source Eq. (1) puts a constraint
    on the location entity. It makes any arbitrary location set L all a finite set.
    Whereas, Eq. (2) makes sure that there exist at least one location from L all
    on which monitoring must be performed. These two equations are necessary for the
    working of monitoring layer in real time. The data generated from any L x is then
    passed on to the upper layer of the architecture stack. B. UAV Layer This layer
    has the actual UAVs which are physically deployed on any particular location L
    a ∈ L all for data generation. UAV has a light weight hardware which makes it
    mobile and a low cost device easy to use. This makes it location friendly and
    a very much desirable candidate for deploying it on ground level for any kind
    of location based survey or information generating tasks. The UAVs fly in the
    3D space above the ground on the monitoring area. This layer is capable of producing
    a chain of UAVs interacting with each other. This is also known as UAV swarming.
    The swarming of UAVs is a process of multiple drones working in sync with each
    other to accomplish a particular piece of work. Since, every UAV deployed is range
    specific therefore in order to teleport the information at the distant location
    we can make UAV layer to make a long distance communication. Hence, UAV swarm
    technology comes into the picture, The relaying of messages using UAVs can be
    performed in order to save UAVs running on limited energy and transmit message
    in a range greater than the pre-defined UAV range. { U 1 , U 2 , U 3 …., U n }
    is the set of UAVs deployed in on ground which forms the chain of transmission
    alongside where needs to be taken care in this case. The various possible cyber-attacks
    discussed in Section 2 appear significant in this layer. This is an open issue
    which needs to be addressed. The cyber-attack would cost a plenty of loss for
    mission specific applications since the data integrity and confidentiality are
    the important outlooks. which make use of UAVs. For these reasons, we make use
    of the next layer proposed in the architecture stack, i.e., quantum layer. Various
    properties of quantum mechanics can be exploited so that a system can achieve
    a better architectural security than the classical security which is prone to
    cyber-invasions. C. Quantum Layer In this layer, the data produced by the above
    layers is transferred securely. Here, we make use of quantum cryptography as an
    amenity to protect the sensitive information present in L all from the monitoring
    layer. The quantum cryptography exploits the concepts of physics in order to provide
    secure transmission. We make use of a quantum key distribution paradigm here to
    exchange the private key securely using existing QKD protocols. One such protocol
    is described here (i.e, BB84 protocol). 1) Background Concepts for BB84 BB84 is
    a key exchange protocol which can generates a random shared private key between
    two parties (let’s say two UAVs U 1 and U 2 ). BB84 protocol make use of classical
    communication channel for the authentication of U 1 and U 2 . BB84 is a measure
    and prepare algorithm. In which we measure the state of the quantum bit (qubit)
    to get information present in it. BB84 make use of two different channels (quantum
    and classical), both channels can be implemented using the free space wireless
    communication. 2) BB84 Protocol This protocol is termed BB84 which explains the
    transmission of data using the polarization of a single photon state. FIGURE 6
    shows the flow of BB84 protocol. However, BB84 is defined as the two pairs of
    nearby states that can be utilized for the protocol and the contrast-to-coded
    states that are utilized in many fiber-based implementations. A quantum communication
    channel that connects the two parties (two UAVs, UAV and the ground control station)
    sender ( U 1 ) to the receiver ( U 2 ), allowing quantum states to be exchanged.
    When it comes to photons, this generally involves a fiber-optic connection or
    an open-plan environment. They can also communicate with the general public through
    traditional media like radio or the Internet. The protocol is built on the idea
    that an adversary can interfere with the quantum channel in any way, but the classical
    channel must be verified. Encryption of data in non-orthogonal states is used
    to ensure protocol security. Quantum uncertainty denotes the difficulty to measure
    these states without destroying the initial state. Each pair in the BB84 is connected
    to a different pair, and the two states are at various angles with one another.
    The term “basis” refers to a pair of orthogonal states. FIGURE 6. BB84 protocol
    structure. Show All In BB84, the initial phase is quantum transmission. The sender
    produces a random bit, either 0 or 1, and then selects one of two basis in this
    case: rectilinear, or diagonal can be defined in Eq. (3). Basis= R= D= {R,D} {0,90}
    {45,135} (3) (4) (5) View Source The value of the bits and the base determines
    the polarization of both the photons, as indicated in the FIGURE 7 below.’0’ is
    encoded as in polarization of the vertical position of the drive in a rectilinear
    basis (+), 1 is encoded as in diagonal basis (x) of 135 state. This can be visualized
    by Eqs. (4) and (5). Alice uses a quantum channel to send a single photon in the
    state specified to the receiver. The procedure is repeated from the random bit
    stage, with sender storing the state, basis, and time of each photon delivered.
    Quantum physics (especially quantum indeterminacy) can discriminate between the
    four distinct polarization states since they are not all orthogonal. The only
    measurement that may be made is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal
    basis). Measuring on a rectilinear basis, for example, gives a horizontal or vertical
    result. This measures the proper state if the photon was generated as horizontal
    or vertical (rectilinear eigenstates). Still, if it was generated as 45° or 135°
    (diagonal eigenstates), the rectilinear measurement gives horizontally or vertically
    at randomness. Moreover, the photon is polarised in the state where it was measured
    (horizontal or vertical) after this measurement, and all information about its
    initial polarization is lost. FIGURE 7 shows the detailed working of BB84 algorithm.
    FIGURE 7. BB84 protocol Working with shared key 0101. Show All U 2 does not know
    which basis for photon storage is best. Therefore, the only option he has is to
    select an arbitrary basis, such as to measure in either rectilinear or diagonal.
    The time taken to measure it is recorded, and the measurement result for each
    photon is received. U 2 is on the public classical channel talking to the U 1
    , and he is the focus of the system’s activities. The sender then broadcasts the
    basis using which it sends the bits publicly. The U 2 then verifies the correctness
    of the basis with which it measured the states of the qubits. The incorrectly
    measured are then discarded by both parties and this is how the shared random
    key is generated between two parties. A predetermined subset of sender and receiver’s
    remaining bit strings is now compared. If a third party has learned anything about
    the polarisation of the photons, the receiver’s observations will be skewed. Other
    conditions, such as the environment, might create mistakes in the same way. They
    reject the key and start again, potentially with another quantum channel, when
    more than p bits differ because the key’s security cannot be guaranteed. D. Internet
    Layer Internet layer makes the data route from one region to other regions. 5G
    is one of the latest mobile communication technology that can yield high speed
    ( S x = up to 2 GBits/s [50]). The internet layer here makes use beyond 5G network
    technology. The reason behind using beyond 5G is that it can provide ubiquitous
    connectivity, low latency ( ≤ 1 millisecond), large spectrum (better than the
    previous generations), and scalability. All these properties support quick data
    transfer in line with virtualisation as well as in UAV swarming networks. Many
    sensitive applications (such as healthcare, disaster management, military, etc.)
    are intolerant of delays in information transmission. Therefore, beyond 5G networks
    are well-suited for such applications. The Internet layer in this architecture
    is eligible for catering to the two communication channels (i.e., quantum and
    classical) mentioned in the quantum layer. The 5G wireless network is capable
    of carrying photons as well as classical bits. The real implementation of these
    channels makes use of the Internet layer (which is the wireless communication
    layer). The low latency of the Internet layer can make the communication faster
    and the quantum layer can make the communication secure. E. Control Layer It is
    the last layer in the architecture stack. It consists of a centralized data and
    control centre for UAVs for storing and fetching the real-time data generated
    by the above layers. This layer consist of all storage facilities, quantum computing
    equipment, and a proper cloud-based infrastructure. The L all data will be stored
    on the servers. The QKD between any arbitrary U a and U b where a,b ∈  U all can
    be performed using actual quantum computers present at the control station. This
    layer also take care of controlling the UAV operations deployed on the ground.
    SECTION V. Battlefield Application in Internet of Military Things: A Case Study
    An unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), also termed as a combat drone that can
    be used for reconnaissance, surveillance, target detection, and the recognition
    of military weapons such as missiles, ATGMs, and/or bombs in regions where drone
    assaults are difficult to reach [51]. These drones are generally trailed in real-time
    and have varying levels of control. In contrast to unmanned aerial vehicles, surveillance,
    and reconnaissance, drone assault and combat intelligence are used. This type
    of drone doesn’t need to be a pilot, as it runs without a pilot. The drones are
    small in size, low in weight and can be remote controlled via GCS. Lee De Forest,
    U. A Sanabria, and the founder of radio devices brought the concept of combat
    drones. In 1940, there was an article published by them in Popular Mechanics.
    John Stuart Foster Jr., a nuclear scientist and former head of the Lawrence Livermore
    National Laboratory, invented the advanced military drone. Foster was a model
    airplane hobbyist in 1971 when he got the notion to use his pastime to manufacture
    weapons and drew out blueprints. The defence advanced research projects agency
    produced two prototypes, dubbed “Prairie” and “Calera,” by 1973. They were launched
    into the air by a modified lawnmower motor and could stay in the air for two hours
    while carrying a 28-pound burden [52]. During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel
    used unarmed US Ryan Firebee targeted drones to push Egypt to burn its entire
    anti-aircraft weapons [53]. This mission was accomplished with no damages to Israeli
    pilots, who instantly took advantage of Egypt’s weakened defenses. During the
    Iran–Iraq War in the early ’90s, Iran used a drone containing six RPG-7 rounds
    [54]. In January 2014, 2,400 individuals were reported to have perished as a consequence
    of US drone attacks. In June 2015, the death count from US drone attacks had risen
    to 6,000 in only five years. The Internet of military things (IoMT) for the battlefield
    application may be using traditional security techniques or cryptography methods
    to improve secure data communication, which is referred in Section 2.3 origin
    and timeline of cryptography. In traditionally the drone of battlefields application,
    they may be starts by the 1G to 5G communication concerning their latency that
    is 1G latency is < 1000 ms, 2G latency is < 600 to 750 ms, 3G latency is < 100
    ms, 4G latency is < 10ms, 5G latency is ~ 5ms. In battlefield application, we
    cannot even a bear delay of 1ms . So, we need an ultra-low latency network that
    is beyond the 5G network which gives < 1 ms latency. The proposed system can be
    used for battlefield application in the IoMT environment. There are some issues
    in battlefield applications with the traditional communication networks discussed
    in the next subsection. A. Issues in Battlefield Applications This subsection
    throws light briefly on the issues that have been identified in the traditional
    battlefield communication set-up. These issues are the very basis of this research
    article. We develop a full-fledged solution to address all the following issues
    by exploiting the quantum cryptography and latest generation of networks (beyond
    5G). The flow of communication using the above proposed novel framework in battle
    field applications can be seen in FIGURE 8. FIGURE 8. Battlefield application
    architecture. Show All 1) Latency and Reliability Communication latency and reliability
    in traditional networks are not suitable for UAVs used in the battlefield application.
    In such applications, the system cannot even bear a delay of 1ms and also can
    not afford system unavailability, which causes serious disaster to the people
    as well as the property. The proposed system uses beyond 5G networks that offers
    <1ms round-trip latency and 99.99999% reliability, which is quite suitable for
    military applications. 2) Security and Privacy In battlefield application, the
    signal interception, deciphering, and reconnaissance in UAV communication may
    cause the breach of the nation’s sensitive information. So, the security and privacy
    of data is a major concern in UAV communication. To secure UAV communication from
    cyber criminals, various security algorithms (digital signatures, RSA, SHA256,
    and many more) and machine learning techniques (decision tree, ensemble learning,
    artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, and many more) can be utilized.
    However still, the data can be changed, which might result in incorrect outcomes.
    To handle this, the proposed system uses quantum cryptography along with BB84
    protocol to secure sensitive military information from cyber-attacks. 3) Throughput
    Throughput means how much data has been processed per unit time. The throughput
    of traditional 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5g are networks are estimated as 9.6 kbps,
    2Mbps, 100 to 300 Mbps, up to 3 Gbps, and 1 Tbps respectively. So, such throughput
    are not highly preferable for battlefield application, where we need much higher
    throughput to process more tasks at single instance of time for better and efficient
    decision making. To achieve this, the proposed system’s beyond 5G network is perfectly
    suitable. 4) Integrity In battlefield application, the combat drone’s integrity
    can be compromised if data sent across the channel is changed. The data or information
    sent between the combat drones and the GCS is incorrect, and the attacker can
    use it to manage these battlefields for his own purpose. Integrity vulnerabilities
    are may be responsible for different types of attacks like the man in the middle,
    hijacking, replay, and GPS spoofing attacks. The integrity of UAV-assisted battlefield
    applications can be ensured using quantum cryptography. The utilization of drones
    in battlefield application make use of quantum cryptography to exchange the sensitive
    data over the wireless channel, such as beyond 5G networks. The communication
    can either be drone to drone or drone to ground station. The two party communication
    in here is quite secure and fast. Hence, it is exactly full-filing the requirement
    of mission-critical applications. The implementation of the proposed methodology
    performance is analyzed in the next subsection. B. Case Study Analysis (Performance
    Analysis) This section covers the performance analysis of the proposed quantum
    cryptography-based system. We have performed a detailed theoretical analysis of
    the components of our novel architecture. The analysis involves the latency and
    throughput of the underlying network, which is to be used in the implementation
    and the quantum supremacy to achieve security above the existing classical security
    paradigms. Below is the detailed analysis for the same. 1) Latency Analysis FIGURE
    9 shows the comparative analysis of round-trip times (RTTs) of various communication
    protocols such as 4G, 5G, and beyond 5G. As observed from the graph, the time
    taken by beyond 5G networks is way less than that of 4G and 5G networks. This
    provides an edge to the beyond 5G networks over the others. Fast communication
    assists the mission sensitive tasks and hence it is very much required. FIGURE
    9. Comparison of round-trip time taken by 4G, 5G, and beyond 5G networks. Show
    All 2) Quantum Cryptography One of the major components of the above-proposed
    architecture is quantum technology. The properties of quantum physics introduced
    into the field of cryptography enhances the security aspect. Quantum cryptography
    is a budding area of research in which cryptography can be seen in terms of physics
    and not rely on mathematical functions (as in traditional cryptography). The superposition
    and quantum state measurement allow the sender and receiver to trace the third
    party attacks. 3) Throughput Analysis Throughput is described as the amount of
    time taken by the data to be processed by the network. The detailed analysis is
    presented in the graph below. FIGURE 10 shows the throughput comparison of 4G,
    5G, and beyond 5G networks with respect to different data block sizes. From FIGURE
    10, we can observe that the time taken by the packets to process the data blocks
    is the least in case of beyond 5G networks. Therefore, it is we choose to implement
    using the best available network that is beyond 5G. FIGURE 10. Comparison of throughput
    performance of 4G, 5G, and beyond 5G. Show All SECTION VI. Open Issues and Challenges
    A. Data Handling The data generated from UAV sensors is massive in volume due
    to the constant data sensing process. The beyond 5G communication network operates
    at a high frequency of 95 GHz to 3 THz, with data transmission rates of up to
    1 Tb/s, and a bandwidth of 1 THz, which is faster than existing communication
    technologies. It also has a latency of less than <1ms . Hence, handling and processing
    the data simultaneously will be an issue if we don’t have enough resources to
    manage the data. The data has a “volume” feature, which generates with velocity
    ‘v’ and latency ‘l’. The total data generation time(t) will be t=l+v . The big
    data handling will further require proper data analysis for the same. Thus, this
    is an open research area in which the data management is highly prioritized. B.
    Energy Management UAVs are lightweight and battery-operated flying devices with
    a limited flying time. UAVs and beyond 5G infrastructure generate huge amounts
    of some scenario-based applications of UAV data at specific intervals. As a result,
    handling such a huge quantity of data in a UAV scenario requires a lot of computing
    power, which will result in draining the short-lived batteries in the UAVs. To
    solve these issues, we can try to manage all the data separately in a decentralised
    manner. The ready-made data, when fed to the UAV, will result in less computation
    and processing. The energy vs computation trade-off will always affect the UAV’s
    physical output performing capabilities when deployed in any workspace. C. Physical
    Attacks on UAVs Although UAVs in real-time can generate and process a massive
    amount of data and transmit it to other UAVs and GCS. The security of UAV will
    always remain on high priority to safeguard it against physical attacks such as
    hijacking, physical tampering of UAV components, etc. A lightweight and power-constraint
    UAVs cannot protect themselves from the external factors disturbing them in the
    open airspace. UAVs can be hijacked despite their performance potential. UAVs
    deployed on the ground are highly prone to physical attacks, especially when deployed
    in the mission sensitive domains (such as the military), which can tamper with
    the hardware component of UAVs and make them non-functional. The physical intrusion
    of the UAV can affect its ongoing task performance in real-time. D. BB84 is Prone
    to Man-in-the-Middle Attack BB84 is a quantum key distribution protocol that uses
    both quantum and classical communication channels for the key exchange process.
    The authentication of two parties (Alice and Bob) usually takes place using the
    classical channel, which exposes this protocol to intruders. When Alice and Bob
    try to exchange photons, there is a possibility that an intruder, Eve, can come
    and intervene in the transmission by mimicking itself as a sender (i.e., Alice
    in this case) since the authentication channel used here is very much prone to
    attacks. To which the possible solution is to integrate the distributed authentication
    process [55]. E. PNS Attack During Key Exchange PNS stands for photon number splitting.
    This attack majorly focuses on the photons that are produced, not ideally single.
    The photon generator might not always have a single photon but multiple photons
    in one go. These multiple-photons are then become useful to the intruders. The
    intruder Eve will try to measure the tiny portion of the photon coming from Alice
    and then send the remaining photon to Bob. Measuring the tiny portions might help
    the intruder guess the key that is being exchanged by measuring the small number
    of photons on the correct basis publicly broadcasted by Alice later. The PNS attack
    is quite difficult to implement since the probability of multi-photon generation
    from the pulse emitter is 50% [56]. Even for measuring the portion of multi-photons,
    Eve would require proper hardware and algorithms. The implementation of this type
    of attack is hence a difficult operation. This attack is quite powerful if executed
    in real-time and hence not suitable for mission-specific applications. F. Quantum
    States are Destroyed Once Measured The quantum states initially are in superposition
    when not measured. Upon measurement, the quantum state is disintegrated and becomes
    a classical bit whose value is either ‘0’ or ‘1’. This property of qubits allows
    them to secure the system. The sender and receiver will know about the intrusion
    and will restart the qubits’ transmission from the beginning. This process would
    be an overhead; the attacks are happening now and then on the system. The system
    will end up restarting the qubit streaming only. G. Quantum Channel Break Down
    The quantum channel is a medium through which we can communicate quantum information
    (mostly qubits in this case). It is fairly a secure channel, also known as a trace-preserving
    channel. The quantum channel can be implemented using optical fibre or free airspace
    (wireless) in real-time. This channel is hence vulnerable to intruders. If not
    able to intercept and read the data, the third party is very much capable of demolishing
    the channel, which will refute the quantum services. The sender and receiver will
    not be able to connect and transmit using quantum technology. H. Cost Efficiency
    The quantum facility is difficult to store at room temperature since it requires
    everlasting cold storage. This whole quantum apparatus to be stored and managed
    properly require expertise. To solve this issue, we can use the virtualization
    of the quantum services through cloud infrastructure. Again, the cloud facilities
    will cost the end user more if the quantum facilities are utilized too much (as
    per the requirement of the application). The affordability of these services rendered
    by the cloud service providers that follow “pay-as-you-go” business model is still
    a question. We might be able to solve this issue by using mobile-edge computing.
    I. Central Node Failure The solution to the previous issue was to use a hassle-free
    cloud amenity which is very prominent these days. Here, the cloud is considered
    the central entity for all the secure key exchange happening across the sender
    and the receiver. The central node completely runs the system. This node’s availability
    and reliability is important here since the mission sensitive jobs cannot bear
    the central node failure. The dependency of the system in the central node can
    fail the whole system. This issue can be addressed using the concept of decentralization,
    where data is readily available as well as secure. Recently an Australian company
    named “Quantum brilliance” has successfully made a quantum computer that is adequately
    operable at room temperature. That quantum computer consists of only five qubits
    as of now. In future, if the quantum facility becomes temperature friendly, we
    can get rid of central dependency. SECTION VII. Conclusion This study is majorly
    focused on making UAV communication more secure as the usage of drones is getting
    popular across the globe. The data generated and transferred using UAVs is considered
    valuable due to its massive application in numerous domains. In today’s cryptographic
    world, the real challenges towards handling data security and transfer must be
    addressed. This study analysed the various aspects of making the UAV communication
    safe and sound when the application is mission-specific. Herein we exploit the
    attributes of quantum cryptography and beyond 5G networks to make the drone communication
    more to shield the data transfer and the data itself. we specifically included
    one of the quantum cryptographic algorithms BB84, which is very safe and different
    from the existing traditional cryptographic algorithms. The heart of this research
    is the novel architecture in which we are proposing to improvise the UAV to UAV
    and UAV to GCS communication. The above-proposed work is majorly helpful for applications
    where the task is time-sensitive or the data is highly confidential, requiring
    special infrastructure. The proposed architecture is prone to various challenges
    discussed in section 7. The future directions of this study aim to resolve all
    the possible challenges and implement tamper-proof communication between the drones.
    As a part of future work of this study, we aim to develop a simulated or real
    layered architecture and then implement it using real quantum hardware (by quantum
    infrastructure providers such as IBM qiskit, AWS- Braket, etc.) in the field of
    drone communication. The future of cryptography holds quantum technology which
    puts behind the traditional means of securing the data. Authors Figures References

    \ sector is one of the backbones of many countries’ economies. Its processes\n\
    have been changing to enable technology adoption to increase productivity, quality,\
    \ and sustainable\ndevelopment. In this research, we present a scientiﬁc mapping\
    \ of the adoption of precision techniques\nand breakthrough technologies in agriculture,\
    \ so-called Digital Agriculture. To do this, we used\n4694 documents from the\
    \ Web of Science database to perform a Bibliometric Performance and\nNetwork Analysis\
    \ of the literature using SciMAT software with the support of the PICOC protocol.\n\
    Our ﬁndings presented 22 strategic themes related to Digital Agriculture, such\
    \ as Internet of Things\n(IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Climate-smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSA), among others. The\nthematic network structure of the nine\
    \ most important clusters (motor themes) was presented and\nan in-depth discussion\
    \ was performed. The thematic evolution map provides a broad perspective\nof how\
    \ the ﬁeld has evolved over time from 1994 to 2020. In addition, our results discuss\
    \ the main\nchallenges and opportunities for research and practice in the ﬁeld\
    \ of study. Our ﬁndings provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the main themes related\
    \ to Digital Agriculture. These results show the\nmain subjects analyzed on this\
    \ topic and provide a basis for insights for future research.\nKeywords: precision\
    \ agriculture; agriculture 4.0; digital agriculture; smart farming; industry 4.0;\n\
    sustainability; innovation; bibliometrics; science mapping\n1. Introduction\n\
    The ﬁeld and the concept itself of agriculture have dramatically changed and have\n\
    been profoundly revolutionized over time, with the introduction of new approaches\
    \ and\nconcepts, such as those of Precision Agriculture (PA) and Agriculture 4.0\
    \ (A4.0). These have\ngiven rise to so-called Digital Agriculture (DA). Around\
    \ 10,000 years ago, humans began to\ndedicate efforts to domesticating plants\
    \ and animals, spreading seeds, planting seedlings,\nand using animal force to\
    \ plow the land [1]. This revolution that changed human life and\ntransformed\
    \ hunter-gatherers into farmers is called the Neolithic Revolution or the First\n\
    Agricultural Revolution [2]. Although this revolution was a great leap for humankind—as\n\
    it allowed the cultivation of plants and guaranteed food for the population—the\
    \ new\nactivities demanded more hours of work [2]. This dedication to agriculture\
    \ generated\na surplus of food that multiplied the number of people and created\
    \ elites who owned\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21237889\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n2 of 28\nand controlled\
    \ land and food [2]. Between the First Agricultural Revolution and the\nprosperous\
    \ and abundant society that we have today, thousands of years have passed, and\n\
    several transformations have occurred in the ways of production, and several difﬁculties\n\
    related to economic niches, malnutrition and wars over ﬁelds and cultures have\
    \ arisen [2].\nThese signiﬁcant disadvantages and shortcomings have led to new\
    \ transformations and\nrevolutions in the ﬁeld of agriculture [3].\nIn the 19th\
    \ century, Agriculture 2.0, also known as the Second Agricultural Revolution,\n\
    changed farming by introducing ad hoc machinery, selective breeding, animal fertilizer,\n\
    crop rotation, reapers and tractors that contributed to shaping the ﬁrst steps\
    \ of modern\nagriculture [1]. Food started to be produced faster in this frame,\
    \ but farmers were hindered\nby rust, pests, and soil depletion. New techniques\
    \ and technologies have increased food\nsurplus and reduced the need for labor\
    \ in agriculture, forcing the migration of workers\nand the urbanization and the\
    \ growth of cities [4,5]. This workforce allocation in towns was\nan integral\
    \ part of the industrial revolution, which stimulated the rise of manufacturing\n\
    industries [4].\nTo deal with the challenges of the Second Agricultural Revolution,\
    \ Agriculture 3.0 or\nthe Third Agricultural Revolution emerged in the 20th and\
    \ early 21st centuries. Between\n1966 and 1985, the concept of the Green Revolution\
    \ was introduced, especially in terms\nof the use of advanced, cutting-edge technologies,\
    \ such as biotechnology and genetic\nengineering to generate genetically varieties,\
    \ hybrid plants and animals [6,7], and this\nprovided a real breakthrough in agriculture.\
    \ The third revolution was characterized by\nthe further introduction of new technologies,\
    \ such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem) to monitor animals and crops,\
    \ computers and devices for data management and\nanalysis of agricultural production-related\
    \ information, robots, chemicals, fertilizers, and\nirrigation systems to increase\
    \ productivity and production quality [1]. These transforma-\ntions greatly impacted\
    \ the quality of agricultural production and the societal, economic,\nand environmental\
    \ pillars of sustainability [8].\nThe concept of PA emerged in 1980 and represented\
    \ the adoption of precision tech-\nniques and technologies used singly or in combination\
    \ [9] to control ﬁeld variability [10,11].\nDespite the concept of PA appearing\
    \ during the Third Agricultural Revolution, its tech-\nniques and technologies\
    \ were mainly exploited in the context of the Fourth Industrial\nRevolution, driven\
    \ by the Industry 4.0 concept [11]. A4.0 represents the use of technologies\n\
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence, big data, cloud\
    \ computing,\nand other smart systems and devices for managing crops and farms\
    \ [11,12]. In this sense,\nboth terms are related to DA, which can be perceived\
    \ as a major driver for changes and\nevolution in sustainability, food security,\
    \ efﬁciency, and productivity.\nDespite the fact that these revolutions have,\
    \ at least partially, solved food production\nand security problems, the increase\
    \ in population and the scarcity of resources are worri-\nsome challenges for\
    \ modern agriculture. Nowadays, almost one billion people go to sleep\nhungry\
    \ every day [13]. The human population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050\
    \ [11],\nincreasing food demand by up to 50% [14]. Most of these people are expected\
    \ to live in\nSouth Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 20% of the current\
    \ population is\nfood insecure [15]. In addition, agriculture is responsible for\
    \ consuming 70% of the world’s\ndrinking water [11]. Human consumption of resources\
    \ has tripled in the last 50 years, and\nthe exploitation of resources is 30%\
    \ greater than nature’s ability to regenerate [16]. From\nthis perspective, the\
    \ challenges involved in producing more food with less environmental\nimpact are\
    \ evident [17]. Given this backdrop, emerging technologies can enable sustainable\n\
    agricultural production, and the main challenges, in terms of either structural\
    \ or perceived\nobstacles and barriers, as well as the major opportunities of\
    \ their technological adoption,\nneed to be explored.\nSeveral studies have revised\
    \ the changes and revolutions that have occurred in the\nﬁeld of agriculture to\
    \ understand the effects of technology adoption and its potential to deal\nwith\
    \ challenges related to food production for the current and future generations.\
    \ Kim et al.\n(2019) and Raparelli and Bajocco (2019) [18,19] performed bibliometric\
    \ analyses on the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n3 of 28\nuse of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAV) in agriculture, and Terence and Purushothaman\n(2020) and Navarro et al.\
    \ (2020) [20,21] systematically reviewed the use of IoT in smart\nfarms. In addition,\
    \ previously published studies explored the use of Machine Learning\n(ML) techniques\
    \ [22–24], geospatial technology [25], and big data for smart farming [26,27].\n\
    Extensive reviews show PA technologies’ state of the art [28] and the main factors\
    \ that\ninﬂuence technological adoption [29]. Although some reviews and overviews\
    \ have already\nbeen carried out, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated\
    \ the complete\nevolution of the ﬁeld of study over time or discussed the digitalization\
    \ process of agricul-\nture. The present paper addresses precisely this literature\
    \ gap by highlighting the main\nchallenges and opportunities related to Digital\
    \ Agriculture.\nDue to the transformational potential of emerging technologies\
    \ for agriculture overviewed\nin the above-mentioned reviews, the present paper\
    \ is devoted to offering a scientiﬁc map-\nping approach to identify strategic\
    \ themes, the thematic evolution structure and the main\nchallenges and opportunities\
    \ of Digital Agriculture. For this, the PICOC protocol (Popula-\ntion, Intervention,\
    \ Comparison, Outcome, and Context) was used to guide and ensure the\nquality\
    \ of this study. The SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool), developed\
    \ by\nCobo et al. (2012) [30], was used for data treatment and generation of the\
    \ strategic diagram\nand the evolutionary map of the ﬁeld of study.\nThe paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the research background.\nSection\
    \ 3 contains materials and methods.\nResults and discussions are presented in\n\
    Section 4. The main challenges and opportunities are presented in Section 5, and\
    \ Section 6\npresents the conclusions, limitations, and suggestions for further\
    \ research.\n2. Research Background\nDifferent terms can be used (and have been\
    \ used) to refer to the ﬁelds of PA and\nA4.0 [31]. Some authors closely associate\
    \ them, whereas, in the current work, we operate\na distinction between PA and\
    \ A4.0. While PA is often related to issues of ﬁeld variability\nand speciﬁc analyses\
    \ and technologies, such as application of agricultural inputs in areas\nwith\
    \ the most signiﬁcant productive potential (e.g., the use of georeferenced data\
    \ for\nthe application of chemicals according to the needs of each area), A4.0\
    \ goes beyond the\nanalysis of ﬁeld variability and aims to manage farms based\
    \ on detailed knowledge of the\nspeciﬁc context and situation, to create a value\
    \ chain that fully integrates, incorporates\nand involves stakeholders, technologies\
    \ and agricultural processes [11,31,32]. Due to the\nvariety of concepts, theoretical\
    \ frameworks/approaches and interpretations related to the\ntechnological adoption\
    \ in agriculture, in this research, the term Digital Agriculture is used\nto describe\
    \ both concepts associated with digital transformation in agriculture without\n\
    considering the technological level.\n2.1. Precision Agriculture\nThe PA concept\
    \ represents the use of techniques and emerging technologies for crop\nmanagement,\
    \ pest control and ﬁeld improvement [11,33]. With PA, it is possible to increase\n\
    crop quality and crop productivity. Since 1980, with the introduction of sophisticated,\n\
    cutting-edge analyses, there has been a considerable increase in the use of technology\
    \ in\nagriculture. For instance, the global soybean production could be 32 million\
    \ tons higher\nif the PA were massively adopted [34]. Progressively, new techniques\
    \ and technologies\nwere developed, with researchers and practitioners gradually\
    \ exploring how to provide an\nenhanced range of advantages for the primary sector\
    \ [11].\nTherefore, several studies have shown the importance of the adoption\
    \ of PA for\nreducing/minimizing environmental impacts while preserving food production\
    \ [35–37].\nFor instance, the efﬁcient analysis of phosphorus and potassium through\
    \ PA technologies\ncontributes to agriculture being more sustainable [34]. PA\
    \ research is also related to\nthe identiﬁcation of management zones [38,39],\
    \ analysis and management of soil and\nplant nutrients [40–42], UAV applications\
    \ for a proper capture and analysis of plantation\ndata [43,44], farmers’ perception\
    \ [45] and others.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n4 of 28\nRelated to PA, there are\
    \ several terms and concepts, ranging from Precision/Open\nField/Farming (PF)\
    \ to Precision Horticulture (PH) (or controlled-environmental agriculture\n(CEA)\
    \ and Vertical Farming (VF)), Precision Animal Farming (PAF), including Precision\n\
    Aquaculture (Fisheries). These sectors are also very important in food production,\
    \ being\n“concentrated capital” and “economically and technologically manageable”.\
    \ This reﬂects\nthe non-uniform, but multi-faceted and complex nature of the ﬁeld\
    \ of PA.\n2.2. Agriculture 4.0\nThe concept of A4.0 emerged after the introduction\
    \ and development of the concept of\nIndustry 4.0 in 2011 and seeks to use the\
    \ same technologies used by factories of the future\nto create a new level of\
    \ agricultural production for ensuring food safety and protection\nof the environment\
    \ [11]. A4.0 represents the use of emerging technologies to develop a\nvalue chain\
    \ that successfully integrates organizations, farmers, customers, and all relevant\n\
    stakeholders in favor of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Therefore,\
    \ A4.0\nis important for mitigating several global concerns related to productivity,\
    \ proﬁtability,\ncost reduction and efﬁciency [11], including mitigating against\
    \ climate change effects and\nallocating agricultural resources in a reasonable\
    \ and ethical way [35]. Given this, there\nis an evident growing interest from\
    \ the scholarly community towards the topic of digital\nagriculture [46].\nA4.0\
    \ seems to be a more comprehensive and broader concept than PA, as it seeks\n\
    to integrate all actors in agri-food production through a technological value\
    \ chain. In\nthis perspective, A4.0 goes beyond local and speciﬁc analyses to\
    \ include all agricultural\nprocesses. Studies related to A4.0 address the development\
    \ of decision support systems to\nintegrate all members of the production chain\
    \ [1], responsible innovation [47], real-time\nintegration of IoT for agriculture\
    \ [48], and the potential of A4.0 to address major societal\nissues associated\
    \ with environmental sustainability (e.g., carbon emissions and exploitation\n\
    of natural resources), social (e.g., impact on labor and food security) and economic\
    \ sustain-\nability (e.g., productivity, costs and agriculture as a subsistence\
    \ economy) [11,32,49–52],\namong others.\n3. Materials and Methods\nWe use the\
    \ PICOC protocol and SciMAT software to perform a Bibliometric Perfor-\nmance\
    \ and Network Analysis (BPNA) to achieve our goal. PICOC ensured the robustness\n\
    and deﬁnition of the research criteria. At the same time, SciMAT helped identify\
    \ the strate-\ngic themes, the thematic evolution structure and the main challenges\
    \ and opportunities in\nthe ﬁeld of study.\n3.1. PICOC Protocol\nThe PICOC protocol\
    \ was used to deﬁne the research questions [53], the key terms\nand variants [54],\
    \ and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of papers\nrelated\
    \ to the ﬁeld of study [55]. This method ensures the quality and reproducibility\
    \ of\nthe research with the lowest bias from the researchers. In this study, the\
    \ process of the\nPICOC protocol was adapted, slightly modifying the search and\
    \ analysis steps presented\nby Bruzza et al. (2017) and Silva et al. (2020) [55,56].\
    \ Table 1 shows the attributes according\nto the PICOC protocol.\nWith the support\
    \ of the PICOC protocol, we deﬁned three major research questions\n(RQ1–3):\n\
    RQ1: What are the strategic themes related to Digital Agriculture?\nRQ2: How has\

    Bibliometric software\nScience Mapping Analysis Software Tool (SciMAT)\nFor bibliometric\
    \ analysis and identiﬁcation of strategic themes and the evolutionary\nmap of\
    \ the ﬁeld, we used the SciMAT software developed by Cobo et al. (2012) [30].\
    \ We\nchose the SciMAT because it assists all stages of scientiﬁc mapping, from\
    \ data preprocessing\nto the generation of maps of the ﬁeld of study [30,52,59,60].\
    \ In addition, the SciMAT\npresents a robust preprocessing module, which ensures\
    \ data quality [30]. With the support\nof the SciMAT, we plotted a strategic diagram\
    \ and the intellectual network structure of the\nmost important themes [61–63].\
    \ In addition, it was possible to generate an evolutionary\ndiagram that presented\
    \ the most important themes of the ﬁeld of study distributed over\ntime. Figure\
    \ 1 illustrates an example of the strategic diagram (a), thematic network structure\n\
    (b), and thematic evolution structure (c), where the size of the clusters represents\
    \ the\nnumber of associated documents and the importance of the theme for the\
    \ research ﬁeld,\nand the thickness of the lines represents the strength of the\
    \ relationship between the\nclusters [30,59,60]. The evolutionary map was created\
    \ based on the equivalence index,\nwhere the solid lines (Figure 1c) indicate\
    \ that the clusters share the main theme (main\ntheme ∈ {thematic nexuses}). In\
    \ contrast, dashed lines represent a connection between the\nnon-main elements\
    \ (main theme /∈ {thematic nexuses}), and the absence of lines means that\nthe\
    \ theme was discontinued from one period to the following period(s) [64].\nSensors\

    \ of 28\nAfter deﬁning the subperiods, we generated the diagrams based on the\
    \ keyword\nco-occurrence matrix with the SciMAT to identify the most important\
    \ themes and their\nnodes with other clusters [66–68]. To determine the similarity\
    \ between themes, data were\nthen normalized using the Equivalence Index [69]\
    \ and clustered based on the Simple\nCenters Algorithm (SCA) to create a network\
    \ of relationships [70]. To make the diagrams,\nwe reduced the data on a frequency\
    \ reduction of eight times. We deﬁned a maximum and\nminimum network of 12 and\
    \ 3, respectively, to plot only the most important clusters of\nthe ﬁeld of study\
    \ (for more information, see Cobo et al. (2012) [30]). The clusters were\nplotted\
    \ on a two-dimensional diagram with four quadrants (Q1–4) (e.g., Figure 1a) whose\n\
    horizontal axis represents the centrality of the themes and their number of connections\n\
    with other themes, and the vertical axis represents the density of the connections\
    \ between\nclusters [11,13,59,60]. In other words, clusters with high centrality\
    \ tend to co-occur with\nmany other themes, while clusters with high density have\
    \ very dense co-occurrence links\nwith speciﬁc themes. This analysis highlights\
    \ the correlational breadth between two or\nmore themes over time. The four quadrants\
    \ are deﬁned as follows:\n•\nMotor themes (Q1): the upper right clusters are highly\
    \ developed themes. The strong\ncentrality and density represent the high number\
    \ of associated documents and the\nmany links between these themes and others.\
    \ In this sense, motor clusters are the\nmost developed and important themes in\
    \ the ﬁeld of study and are related to many\nother subjects/topics.\n•\nBasic\
    \ and transversal themes (Q2): clusters in the lower right quadrant are themes\n\
    that have many relationships with other themes but whose relationships are weak.\n\
    Despite these clusters’ great development and links with different themes, the\
    \ low\ndensity indicates little capacity to sustain over time.\n•\nEmerging or\
    \ declining themes (Q3): they represent clusters with few and weak links\nwith\
    \ other themes, which may appear or disappear in the ﬁeld of study. These\nthemes\
    \ need in-depth qualitative analysis by researchers to identify whether they are\n\
    emerging or declining. Over time, these clusters may cease to be discussed or\
    \ move to\nother quadrants.\n•\nHighly developed and isolated themes (Q4): the\
    \ upper left quadrant comprises of low\ncentrality and high-density clusters.\
    \ These clusters have few but strong links with\nother themes. The strong centrality\
    \ of these themes shows their ability to prevail over\ntime, to develop links\
    \ with other clusters and, perhaps, to become motor themes.\nThe motor themes\
    \ of the strategic diagram were explored to identify the relationships\nwith other\
    \ themes. In this way, it was possible to identify technologies, techniques and\n\
    other widely discussed subjects/topics and the main challenges and opportunities\
    \ of\nDigital Agriculture.\nAs a last remark to the methodology adopted in the\
    \ present study, we would like\nto stress two major points. First, as also previously\
    \ mentioned, to the best of our knowl-\nedge, the present investigation is the\
    \ ﬁrst to perform a bibliometric analysis related to\nthe ﬁeld of Digital Agriculture.\
    \ As such, this study should be intended as being of an\nexploratory nature, providing\
    \ readers with a preliminary, though broad, comprehensive,\nand detailed overview\
    \ of the existing scholarly literature covering the research area of\nDigital\
    \ Agriculture. Therefore, we decided to focus on PA, not including other PA-related\n\
    terms as keywords, and we did not attempt to explore its multi-faceted, complex\
    \ nature\nand its sub-sectors (namely, PH, CEA, VF, PAF or Precision Aquaculture/Fisheries).\
    \ These\naspects warrant further ad hoc reviews (either in the form of systematic\
    \ overviews or\nmapping/scoping reviews), based also on the ﬁndings of the present\
    \ investigation.\n4. Results\nTo explore in-depth the DA ﬁeld, we conducted a\
    \ BPNA, which assesses DA-related\nscholarly performance in terms of productivity\
    \ over time and main journals which pub-\nlished DA-related studies, the strategic\

    In 1994, the term Precision Agriculture started to be widely discussed in studies\n\
    that evaluated the rate of application of inputs in crops [71], the spatial and\
    \ temporal\nvariability of yields [72–74] and the potential of precision techniques\
    \ for conserving natural\nresources [75]. After the initial introduction and its\
    \ subsequent use, the ﬁeld of study\nhas continued to grow, and new concepts have\
    \ emerged over time. In 2011, with the\nemergence/introduction of Industry 4.0,\
    \ the term Agriculture 4.0 came to have a broader\nemphasis and scope for adopting\
    \ digital technology in agriculture and representing the\ncreation of a value\
    \ chain [11,32].\nFigure 2 shows the number of studies published over time and\
    \ highlights the impor-\ntance and expansion of research. In 1994, only ﬁve articles\
    \ related to Digital Agriculture\nwere published, in 2017, the number reached\
    \ 374 articles, and 762 studies were published\nin 2019. In 2020, the data collection\
    \ date justiﬁed the decrease in publications (21 September\n2020). The increase\
    \ in the number of publications in recent years is warranted by the devel-\nopment\
    \ and maturity the ﬁeld is reaching and achieving and by the number of researchers\n\
    who have made efforts to understand the impact of technology adoption in agriculture.\n\
    Different aspects of a ﬁeld of study can be understood and quantiﬁed through bibliometric\n\
    analysis [76]. Uncovering critical elements, such as leading journals and the\
    \ most pro-\nductive authors, can help young researchers to identify important\
    \ journals and seminal\nreferences in the ﬁeld of study [77]. In this sense, Table\

    \ 3) presents 22 clusters distributed in four quadrants\nof the two-dimensional\
    \ diagram, of which nine are motor themes (Q1), two are basic and\ntransversal\
    \ themes (Q2), eight are emerging or declining themes (Q3), and three are highly\n\
    developed and isolated themes (Q4). The size of each cluster is proportional to\
    \ the number\nof associated documents. The horizontal axis represents the links\
    \ from one cluster to others\n(centrality), and the vertical axis demonstrates\
    \ the strength of these links (density). The\ntable in Figure 3 shows the core\
    \ documents, h-index, number of cites, centrality (C), and\ndensity (D) of each\
    \ theme.\nThe ‘UAV’ (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) cluster contains the largest number\
    \ of associ-\nated documents. It is the most expressive theme in terms of h-index,\
    \ number of cites and\ncentrality, highlighting this cluster as one of the most\
    \ discussed themes in the literature.\nThe cluster ‘CSA’ (Climate-smart Agriculture)\
    \ also has expressive core documents. It\nis the ﬁrst ranked in terms of density,\
    \ but its low centrality shows that the relationship\nbetween CSA and other themes\
    \ is still underexplored. Other clusters that stand out are\n‘IoT’ (Internet of\
    \ Things), ‘SPATIAL-VARIABILITY’, ‘GPS’ (Global Positioning System),\n‘IMAGE-PROCESSING’,\
    \ ‘NITROGEN’, ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘YIELD-PREDICTION’\n(Figure 3). These motor\
    \ themes (Q1) are explored in depth through the thematic network\nstructures in\
    \ the following subsection.\nIn addition, ‘NDVI’ (Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index) and ‘SUSTAINABILITY’\nappear to be basic and transversal themes (Figure\
    \ 3) and represent the concern for the sus-\ntainable development of agriculture.\
    \ Other techniques appear related to crop management,\nsuch as ‘WEED-CONTROL’,\
    \ ‘CROP-MODEL’, ‘SOIL-TEXTURE’, ‘PHENOTYPING’, ‘SOIL-\nCOMPACTION’ and ‘WATER-PRODUCTIVITY’,\
    \ and others are related to technologies,\nsuch as ‘HYPERSPECTRAL-IMAGERY’, ‘SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINES’,\
    \ ‘EM38′, and\n‘AGRICULTURAL-ROBOTICS’. Although some clusters represent speciﬁc\
    \ analyses and\ntechniques related to productivity and quality of agricultural\
    \ production, the motor themes\nhighlight the transformation expected for food\
    \ production in the coming years.\n4.3. Motor Themes Related to Digital Agriculture\n\
    We explored the thematic network structure (Figure 4) of the motor themes presented\n\
    in the strategic diagram (Figure 3). This analysis highlights the relationships\
    \ of a cluster\nwith others and provides an in-depth view of the ﬁeld of research.\
    \ The size of each cluster is\nproportional to the number of associated documents,\
    \ and the thickness of the lines denotes\nthe binding force between clusters.\n\
    4.3.1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nThe cluster ‘UAV’ presents signiﬁcant importance\
    \ in the strategic diagram (Figure 3)\ndue to its high degree of interactions\
    \ with the other motor themes. The UAV corresponds\nto a pilotless aircraft, i.e.,\
    \ a ﬂying machine operated with no humans (passenger/pilot)\nonboard [78]. Some\
    \ previous literature reviews and meta-analysis explored the use of\nUAVs in agriculture,\
    \ as in research by Lelong et al. (2012) [79], Singh and Frazier (2018) [80],\n\
    Shahbazi et al. (2014) [81] and Eskandari et al. (2020) [82]. UAVs are low-cost\
    \ and easy-\nto-operate technologies in agriculture [83] that can be adopted for\
    \ spraying in ﬁelds [84],\nsuch as water precision irrigation. Given the technological\
    \ advancement emerging in\ndifferent countries, UAVs have gained more and more\
    \ space and importance for smart\nfarming [83,85]. Various sensors can be coupled\
    \ to UAVs [85] associated with techniques,\nsuch as photogrammetry, Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM), multi-spectral and hyper-spectral\nimages, and technologies,\
    \ such as Machine Learning, LiDAR, and sensors, cameras and\nother hardware and\
    \ software that contribute to monitoring the crop. This seems to justify\nthe\
    \ strong relationship between UAV and the subtheme ‘REMOTE-SENSING’, followed\n\
    by the subthemes ‘MACHINE-LEARNING’ and ‘VEGETATION-INDICES’ among others\n(Figure\
    \ 4a).\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n12 of 28\nFigure 4a shows the relationship between\
    \ UAV and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),\nwhile UAV focuses on the development\
    \ and use of robots; UAS includes ground-based\ncontrollers, communication systems,\
    \ payloads, electro-optical systems, radar, and software\nfor aircraft vehicles.\
    \ The sensors in the drones can generate vegetation indices, helping\nto monitor\
    \ crop growth diagnosis and grain yield prediction [86]; disaster detection in\n\
    environmental areas [87]; the existence of pests and pathogens in the crop; the\
    \ analysis\nof the health and stress status of the vegetation; and the assessment\
    \ of soil fertility for\nappropriate remote management and precise and reduced\
    \ application of agrochemicals,\ndriving sustainable agriculture [85] and increased\
    \ productivity. New, sophisticated, cutting-\nedge techniques and approaches,\
    \ such as machine learning, improve decision-making in the\nﬁeld of precision\
    \ and digital agriculture, assisting and facilitating tasks like the prediction\n\
    of nitrogen index of the crop through remote sensing from UAV [83,88]. Thus, farm-related\n\
    data and information can be easily collected through drones, such as images [89],\
    \ and can\ngenerate knowledge that machine learning techniques can process to\
    \ make agriculture\nmore precise and digital. For instance, Zhang and Zhao (2019)\
    \ [90] used images of coastal\nsoils captured through UAV to identify salinization\
    \ levels and then proposed a method\nto improve the monitoring and management\
    \ of the soil for avoiding the negative impacts\nof salinization on crop growth\
    \ and production. Hence, this cluster highlights the central\nrole of UAV, which,\
    \ together with other emerging technologies, generates precision in\nagriculture\
    \ and enables the interconnection among technologies for better decision-making,\n\
    allowing farms to be smart.\n4.3.2. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)\nCSA (Figure\
    \ 4b) is a concept related to the adoption of best agricultural production\npractices\
    \ and methods for reorienting agriculture for environmental protection, food secu-\n\
    rity and climate change issues [15,91]. The population increase, land and environmental\n\
    degradation, and the negative impacts of the food system on the climate require\
    \ new\nagricultural practices. Within this framework, CSA is an extremely necessary\
    \ approach to\nﬁnd win-win solutions for the sustainable development of agriculture\
    \ [92]. Climate change\nand the degradation of the planet’s biodiversity cause\
    \ risks to the food supply, and the\nvulnerability of people who have agriculture\
    \ as their primary source of subsistence [15].\nTo deal with this, the resilient\
    \ agriculture model proposed by CSA seeks to create adaptive\ncoherence between\
    \ climate and agricultural practices [92]. To assist in the development\nof CSA,\
    \ farmers embrace technological innovations that could make agriculture more\n\
    sustainable. However, great governmental and academic incentives need to be dedicated\n\
    to assisting the agricultural sector in sustainable development [91,92].\nThis\
    \ high-density motor theme is related to sustainable agriculture, which shows\
    \ its\nstrong relationship with climate-related themes (e.g., ‘CLIMATE-CHANGE-ADAPTATION’\n\
    ‘CLIMATE-CHANGE’), environmental preservation (e.g., ‘CONSERVATION-AGRICULTURE’\n\
    ‘AGROFORESTRY’), organizations (e.g., ‘SMALLHOLDER FARMERS’) and discussions\n\
    related to agricultural resilience, food security and the main challenges for\
    \ organizations, es-\npecially for smallholders. Previous systematic reviews explored\
    \ the role of CSA [91,93–95].\nRelated research discusses technological adoption\
    \ [96], farmers’ adaptation to resilient\nagriculture [97], innovative economic\
    \ models [98], emerging ways to increase the resilience\nof smallholder farmers\
    \ [99], and the impact of CSA on food security [100], among other\nissues associated\
    \ with resilient agriculture.\n4.3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe cluster ‘IoT’\
    \ (Figure 4c) has a high degree of interactions with the subtheme\n‘WIRELESS-SENSOR-NETWORKS’,\
    \ followed by ‘BIG-DATA’, ‘ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE’,\n‘CLOUD-COMPUTING’ and others.\
    \ Internet of Things can be deﬁned as a grouping of\ntechnologies and infrastructures\
    \ that, wirelessly connected, enable data mining from inter-\nconnected objects,\
    \ as well as the monitoring and correct management of data [11,101]. It\nallows\
    \ remote access and control of objects [102]. Thus, IoT has been achieving a promi-\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 7889\n13 of 28\nnent role in agriculture. Both the quality and\
    \ quantity of production in the agricultural\nindustry have been maximized through\
    \ IoT [103], such as crop yield and efﬁciency [104].\nIoT technologies, such as\
    \ smart sensor networks, cameras, weather stations and smart-\nphone applications,\
    \ can improve crop data collection and decision-making for smart farm\nmanagement\
    \ [105].\nThere are many ways of adopting IoT in agriculture. Some authors have\
    \ explored\nprevious literature to understand IoT’s role, opportunities and challenges\
    \ in agricul-\nture [106–108]. Jin et al. (2020) [109] proposed a predictor based\
    \ on IoT to accurately\npredict/forecast temperature and humidity in ﬁelds, allowing\
    \ anticipated planning and\ncontrol for sustainable precision agriculture. Jayaraman\
    \ et al. (2016) [105] proposed an IoT\nplatform capable of expanding data collection\
    \ on soil, irrigation, fertilization and environ-\nmental conditions, generating\
    \ relationships among data for forecasting crop performance\nand boosting smart\
    \ farming. Relating IoT to blockchain, Hussain (2019) [110] developed a\nmodel\
    \ capable of helping in the migration from traditional to smart agriculture. Tekiner-\n\
    dogan (2018) [3] used IoT to create a portable agricultural sensor network system,\
    \ which\ncollects data (temperature, light intensity, and soil moisture content)\
    \ utilizing sensors and\na microcontroller to generate databases that can be used\
    \ through Big Data based analytics\nfor better crop management. These IoT actions\
    \ can be further enhanced and maximized\nwhen combined with artiﬁcial intelligence-based\
    \ technologies, which facilitate the man-\nagement of data collected from different\
    \ objects and sources in the ﬁeld [102]. In addition,\nconnectivity on Digital\
    \ Agriculture through IoT becomes efﬁcient and effective when based\non cloud\
    \ computing [111]. Thus, regardless of the applications, IoT actions in agriculture\n\
    require investments in cloud computing to facilitate the collection, storage,\
    \ access, and\nmanagement of integrated data. Therefore, this cluster emphasizes\
    \ the importance of IoT\nas a link among different technologies, tools, equipment,\
    \ and machines that jointly improve\nprecision agriculture and, consequently,\
    \ lead to digital agriculture.\n4.3.4. Spatial Variability\nThe cluster ‘SPATIAL\
    \ VARIABILITY’ (Figure 4d) is a motor theme that presents strong\ninteractions\
    \ with geostatistics and management zones and contributes to monitoring soil\n\
    properties at agricultural sites. The analysis of the spatial variability of soil\
    \ attributes was\none of the ﬁrst precision techniques associated with crop management\
    \ and helps farmers\nto know chemical and physical characteristics of the soil\
    \ through sampling and analysis\nthat identify soil variations such as nutrients,\
    \ fertility, salinity, electrical conductivity, pH,\norganic matter, phosphorus,\
    \ and other important variables/parameters. Geostatistics\ntechniques such as\
    \ kriging, variogram analysis and interpolation reveal the heterogeneity\nof the\
    \ soil. These analyses allow us to understand intrinsic factors, such as soil\
    \ formation\nand relief, substances, organisms and climate, and extrinsic factors,\
    \ such as management\npractices, and fertilization rate, among others.\nTherefore,\
    \ this cluster is linked with increasing efﬁciency and crop productivity. The\n\
    analysis of spatial variability is, indeed, a key factor for increasing food production\
    \ [112]\nand farmers’ economic revenues [113]. The mapping of soil heterogeneity\
    \ has contributed\nto enhance soil data and to make geostatistics become a fundamental\
    \ tool in agricultural\nmanagement [114]. Some studies show that farmers visualize\
    \ the information of DA made\nby georeferenced analysis [115]. Despite its advantages,\
    \ spatial variability analyses often\nhave high costs that make it difﬁcult for\
    \ small farmers to use them. Future research needs\nto explore the improvement\
    \ of these techniques to increase the expansion of its use.\n4.3.5. Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS)\nThrough georeferencing, GPS was one of the ﬁrst big steps towards\
    \ Digital Agri-\nculture. The cluster ‘GPS’ (Figure 4e) is a motor theme that\
    \ presents strong interactions\nwith the subtheme Geographic Information Systems\
    \ (GIS). Other subthemes, such as\n‘YIELD-MONITOR’, ‘YIELD-MAPPING’ and ‘VARIABLE-RATE\
    \ TECHNOLOGY’, also\nhave prominent links with this cluster. Thus, the integration\
    \ of GPS with other smart\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n14 of 28\ntechnologies, such\
    \ as GIS and remote sensing, can boost farming productivity and cost\nefﬁciency\
    \ [116]. GPS corresponds to a navigation system that, using satellites, identiﬁes\n\
    an object’s exact position and velocity around the world and can guide directions\
    \ [117].\nAgricultural activities, such as seeding and plowing, can only be precisely\
    \ conducted using\nvehicle navigation accuracy [118].\nIn previous research, Si\
    \ et al. [118] proposed a method to enhance the accuracy of\nthe steering angle\
    \ of agricultural vehicles by combining GPS with the low-cost Micro-\nelectromechanical\
    \ System (MEMS), which improves DA. Palaniswami et al. [119] argue\nthat the joint\
    \ adoption of GPS and GIS technologies can improve sugarcane cultivation\nin coastal\
    \ lowland ecosystems, making production more precise and sustainable. Khosro\n\
    (2018) [120] developed a strawberry yield-monitoring picking cart, equipped with\
    \ a real-\ntime kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS), different types\
    \ of sensors, a micro-\ncontroller, and an inertial measurement unit to improve\
    \ the synchronization of the carts\nwith robots in harvesting and creating yield\
    \ mapping of strawberry productivity. Com-\nmonly, yield mapping on farms is performed\
    \ using GPS and variable-rate technology for\nboosting planters’ performance [121].\
    \ In addition, Thrikawakaa et al. [122] demonstrate\nthat applying variable-rate\
    \ technology through GPS in agricultural vehicles improves the\nwater content\
    \ in ﬁelds and reduces the application of fertilizers. In addition, previous\n\
    literature reviews introduce the conceptualization and potential of GPS (for more\
    \ informa-\ntion see, Rivero et al., 2021 [123]; Peng et al. (2017) [124]). Thus,\
    \ this cluster highlights the\nrole of GPS as a leading technology capable of\
    \ improving DA’s effectiveness through its\ninterconnecting capacity with other\
    \ smart technologies. Emerging technologies combined\nwith scientiﬁc knowledge\
    \ make it possible to use the strategic geographical location of\nagricultural\
    \ production, helping to make precise and targeted decisions.\n4.3.6. Image Processing\n\
    The cluster ‘IMAGE PROCESSING’ (Figure 4f) presents strong linkages with agricul-\n\
    tural management tools (e.g., ‘MACHINE VISION’ and ‘COMPUTER VISION’) that provide\n\
    data for the farmer’s decision-making. Previous literature reviews explored advanced\
    \ con-\ntrol strategies and image processing techniques in Digital Agriculture\
    \ (see Ngugi et al.\n(2021) [125], Syeda et al. (2021) [126], and Sohail et al.\
    \ (2020) [127]). Zhao et al. [128] used\nmachine vision to exploit color images\
    \ to detect immature green citrus. The use of video pro-\ncessing (i.e., machine\
    \ vision) also was analyzed by Sabzi et al. [129] to classify potato plants\n\
    and three types of weed. In this regard, machine vision was also revised by Wang\
    \ et al. [130],\ncombined with image processing as relevant tools for ‘WEED DETECTION’.\n\
    Machine learning algorithms also are linked with image processing and can assist\n\
    ‘DEEP LEARNING’ in agriculture [131]. ‘ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS’ is an ex-\n\
    ample of the Artiﬁcial Intelligence method [132] to create new forms to solve\
    \ complex\nagricultural problems based on big data. Through image processing,\
    \ several outputs\ncan be processed by machine learning and can be shown in apps\
    \ for smartphones and\ncomputers [133].\n4.3.7. Nitrogen\nThe cluster ‘NITROGEN’\
    \ (Figure 4g), like the ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘YIELD PRE-\nDICTION’ clusters, has\
    \ no stronger relations with some themes than the other clusters. As\nan important\
    \ nutrient for agricultural production, this cluster is related to crop management\n\
    (e.g., ‘MAIZE’ and ‘POTATO’), and fertilizers (e.g., ‘PHOSPHORUS’ and ‘POTASSIUM’).\n\
    The link between ‘NITROGEN’ and these themes comprises several ﬁelds of studies,\
    \ such\nas nitrogen deﬁciency [134], nutrient management [135,136], nutrient loss\
    \ [137], nutrient\nefﬁciency [138], and nutrient monitoring [139]. Therefore,\
    \ the technical agronomic back-\ndrop is preeminent in this cluster. In addition,\
    \ this theme is strongly linked to efﬁciency in\napplying nitrogen and other applications\
    \ of variable-rate technology [135,136,140].\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n15 of 28\n\
    4.3.8. Hyperspectral\nSeveral technologies are being developed and tested to analyze\
    \ plants, soil and crop\nvariables, such as optical sensors, three-dimensional\
    \ (3D) imaging, ﬂuorescence imaging,\nthermography, multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ imaging [141]. The ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’\ncluster (Figure 4h) shows that these analyses\
    \ are standing out in agriculture, mainly because\nhyperspectral imaging is a\
    \ more advanced technique than traditional multispectral imaging\nand allows the\
    \ identiﬁcation of more details of the target features [142]. Hyperspectral\n\
    images are used as an efﬁcient alternative for collecting and processing data\
    \ and creating\nan electromagnetic spectrum of agricultural ﬁelds, being a valuable\
    \ tool for monitoring,\nanalyzing, and providing more accurate detection of spatio-temporal\
    \ variations in crop\nphysiological and morphological characteristics [142,143],\
    \ such as soil attributes and soil\ndegradation. Some previous research explored\
    \ the use of multispectral and hyperspectral\ntechniques in the ﬁeld of Digital\
    \ Agriculture, focusing on high-resolution applications, and\nplant disease detection,\
    \ among others [142,144,145].\nDespite their great potential, hyperspectral images\
    \ are still little used outside the\nacademic context, but this is changing through\
    \ low-cost and mini-sized airborne hyper-\nspectral technologies that are being\
    \ used by farmers [142]. This difﬁculty occurs due to\nthe complexity of technologies\
    \ and algorithms, and the need to store and transfer data\ncollected by hyperspectral\
    \ analysis devices [146]. The signiﬁcance of the ‘HYPERSPEC-\nTRAL’ cluster shows\
    \ the volume of analyzes performed using maps and images of crops.\nThe clusters\
    \ associated with this theme demonstrate analyses related to vegetation in-\n\
    dexes and characteristics (e.g., ‘VEGETATION-INDEX’, ‘CHLOROPHYLL-CONTEXT’,\n\
    ‘CHLOROPHYLL-FLUORESCENCE’ and ‘LEAF-AREA-INDEX’). Previous research used\nhyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing to enable measurement of grapevine drought stress [147],\nidentiﬁcation\
    \ of pests and diseases [148], and assessment of seed germination [149].\n4.3.9.\
    \ Yield Prediction\nYield prediction is historically used in agriculture for farmers\
    \ to plan inputs, labor,\nproﬁtability and other issues related to agricultural\
    \ productivity. The cluster ‘YIELD-\nPREDICTION’ (Figure 4i) in Digital Agriculture\
    \ represents the evolution of predictive\nanalysis on crop yields, which in the\
    \ past was carried out by the knowledge of farmers,\nand is now carried out with\
    \ emerging technologies [98]. In this way, preharvest crop yield\nprediction helps\
    \ farmers to make better and faster decisions related to planting, fertilization,\n\
    irrigation, pruning and the harvesting of plantations [150]. It also contributes\
    \ to the entire\nsupply and consumption chain, and allows the projection of future\
    \ scenarios for food\nproduction [151].\nThis cluster appears related to be related\
    \ to few themes, but we can highlight ‘MOD-\nELING’, ‘IMAGE-ANALYSIS’ and ‘NEURAL-NETWORKS’\
    \ that are used to map and\nmodel crop data and information for future predictions.\
    \ Previous research related to crop\nyield prediction used different techniques\
    \ and technologies to collect and analyze data,\nsuch as Neural Network Techniques\
    \ [100], Unmanned Aerial System Imagery [152], Air-\nborne Optical Sensors [153],\
    \ Artiﬁcial Neural Networks [154], Machine Learning [155–157],\nHyperspectral\
    \ Imagery and Ensemble Learning [158], among others.\n4.4. Thematic Evolution\
    \ Structure\nThe evolutionary map presents the themes that have stood out over\
    \ time. The map\nwas divided into three subperiods to show the most important\
    \ themes according to the\nevolution of the ﬁeld of study. The ﬁrst subperiod\
    \ presents the main themes studied since\nthe ﬁrst mention of the term PA in 1994\
    \ in the ISI/Web of Science until the emergence\nof the Agriculture 4.0 concept\
    \ in 2011. The second subperiod covers the years 2012 to\n2017 and highlights\
    \ the terms widely discussed since the appearance of A4.0. The last\nsubperiod\
    \ (2018–2020) highlights the most current and relevant themes in the literature\
    \ in\nthe previous years. Figure 5 shows the evolutionary map of the ﬁeld of study,\
    \ the size of\nthe clusters is proportional to the number of associated documents,\
    \ while the thickness\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n16 of 28\nof the lines represents\
    \ the relationship between the themes. Continuous lines represent\nconceptual\
    \ nexus and dashed lines have non-conceptual nexus.\n4.4.1. First Subperiod (1994–2011)\n\
    In this subperiod (1994–2011) (Figure 5), we identiﬁed the ﬁrst studies that mentioned\n\
    Digital Agriculture through discussions about the use of technologies to increase\
    \ produc-\ntivity, deal with environmental variability and environmental conservation\
    \ of agribusi-\nness [71–75]. This subperiod contains studies that used hyperspectral\
    \ maps to analyze veg-\netation indices [159,160], imaging techniques [161] and\
    \ geostatistical analysis [162]. Besides,\nFigure 5 shows that technologies started\
    \ to be explored at this time, such as ‘GPS’, ‘HYPER-\nSPECTRAL’ images, and speciﬁc\
    \ analyses of soil and plants, such as ‘SOIL-FERTILITY’,\n‘NITROGEN’, ‘ELECTROMAGNETIC-INDUCTION’,\
    \ ‘PH’, ‘SOIL-COMPACTION’ and\n‘SOIL-TEXTURE’. These themes show that few technologies\
    \ were discussed and most of the\nthemes were associated with crop variability.\
    \ These themes prove that the discussions re-\nlated to Digital Agriculture mainly\
    \ represent the use of technologies such as georeferencing\nto analyze variability\
    \ associated with soil and plants.\nIn this subperiod, the ﬁrst discussions on\
    \ agroecosystems were developed [163] to\ncreate strategies to mitigate against\
    \ environmental damage. It is important to note that\nthis subperiod was one of\
    \ the most important for discussions related to sustainability, as\nresearch was\
    \ paving the way for other in-depth studies aimed at exploring the development\n\
    of resilient agriculture and the sustainable development of agribusiness. In addition,\n\
    many studies in this subperiod predicted that Digital Agriculture would be the\
    \ future of\nagribusiness [164–169].\n4.4.2. Second Subperiod (2012–2017)\nThe\
    \ second subperiod (2012–2017) (Figure 5) was characterized by a greater number\n\
    of documents associated with the consolidated PA motor themes and with emerging\
    \ A4.0\nones, as new technologies started to be discussed as the application of\
    \ UAV [170], wireless\nsensor networks and NDVI. The presence of clusters still\
    \ related to the ﬁrst subperiod, such\nas ‘NITROGEN’, ‘HYPERSPECTRAL’ and ‘GPS’,\
    \ demonstrates that some themes have\nremained strong over time. In addition,\
    \ new themes emerged, such as ‘GEOSTATISTICS’\nwith a signiﬁcant number of documents,\
    \ and ‘SUSTAINABLE-INTENSIFICATION’ and\n‘CSA’ associated with the development\
    \ of resilient and sustainable agriculture, demonstrat-\ning the further expansion\
    \ and growth of the ﬁeld of study [171–173].\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the term\
    \ A4.0 gained space and came to be widely discussed\nin the literature to portray\
    \ the creation of a digital value chain in agriculture. Although\nmany terms are\
    \ discussed in this subperiod, few of them stand out in the volume of\nassociated\
    \ documents and interrelationships with themes from other subperiods. Only\nthe\
    \ ‘GEOSTATISTICS’ cluster has a strong relationship with the ‘SPATIAL-VARIABILITY’\n\
    clusters of the ﬁrst and third subperiods, highlighting the high potential of\
    \ geostatistics\nfor analyzing crop variability. In addition, ‘CSA’ has evolved\
    \ to become one of the main\nthemes of the third subperiod. It is important to\
    \ note that some themes have evolved over\ntime; however, the small size of most\
    \ clusters shows that the ﬁeld of study was still under\ndevelopment.\n4.4.3.\
    \ Third Subperiod (2018–2020)\nThe third subperiod (2018–2020) (Figure 5) presents\
    \ the most recent themes related to\nDigital Agriculture. Three clusters stand\
    \ out with a large volume of associated documents.\nThey are ‘IoT’, ‘UAV’ and\
    \ ‘CSA’, which indicates that the use of emerging technologies and\nsustainable\
    \ development are currently the most important concerns of researchers in the\n\
    primary sector. The ‘IoT’ and ‘UAV’ clusters show the potential and adaptability\
    \ of small\nsensors for any agricultural scenario, whether in large crops or in\
    \ mountainous areas that\nare difﬁcult to cultivate [11], while the ‘CSA’ cluster\
    \ shows that concern for the sustainable\ndevelopment of agriculture continues\
    \ to grow and is characterized as one of the most\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n17\
    \ of 28\nimportant discussions in the arena of smart agriculture [97,100]. In\
    \ addition, discussions\nrelated to deep learning and machine vision represent\
    \ major technological adoptions in the\nﬁeld of agriculture, and themes like ‘APPARENT-ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY’\
    \ [174],\n‘WATER-BALANCE’ [175] and ‘PROXIMAL-SOIL-SENSING’ [176] show that the\
    \ concern\nwith analyses of plants and soil remains extremely important for the\
    \ digital transformation\nof agriculture.\nA broad look allows us to see the evolution\
    \ of the ﬁeld of study and the main themes\ndiscussed over time. The third subperiod\
    \ also produces insights on future trends, because\nsome themes stand out from\
    \ the others and are anticipated to remain of paramount impor-\ntance. Besides,\
    \ other themes have emerged only in the last subperiod and may represent\nemerging\
    \ themes that can be further explored in depth in the coming years. The growth\n\
    in the number of documents in the ﬁeld of study (Figure 2) and discussions associated\n\
    with technological adoption in agriculture (Figure 4) demonstrate the commitment\
    \ of\nresearchers to the development of the primary sector and its importance\
    \ for the sustainable\ndevelopment of society and organizations.\n5. Challenges\
    \ and Opportunities\n5.1. Main Challenges\nDiscussions related to UAV, spatial\
    \ variability, yield prediction and crop model\n(Figure 3) show that there are\
    \ many challenges associated with the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies in agriculture,\
    \ such as variations in soil, climate, sustainability, cultivated\nspecies and\
    \ producer size. Government investments, export volume, agricultural and\nconsumer\
    \ culture are also factors that directly impact the way food is grown and pro-\n\
    duced, and the innovative efforts and investments dedicated to production. Developed\n\
    and emerging economies have different types of governmental investment for agricultural\n\
    production, and some are developing projects aimed at the digital transformation\
    \ of agri-\nculture in countries, like China [177], Brazil [178], Mexico [179],\
    \ Thailand [180,181] and\nothers. Despite the investment of many countries in\
    \ digital agriculture, the transforma-\ntion is still in its infancy compared\
    \ to the technological adoption in the manufacturing\nand service sectors. Technologies\
    \ widely used in other sectors such as big data, Machine\nLearning, blockchain,\
    \ simulation/mathematical modeling and augmented reality are still\nlittle explored\
    \ in agriculture. Figure 3 shows that only Internet of Things and UAV are\nprominent\
    \ technologies in the arena of agriculture.\nAmong the main challenges of digital\
    \ technology, technological adoption is among the\ncharacteristics and peculiarities\
    \ of emerging technologies, which are often complex for the\nlow level of technical\
    \ knowledge of smallholder farmers [45]. The most signiﬁcant volume\nof agricultural\
    \ production is from developing countries, and most of these farmers are\nsmall\
    \ producers with low levels of education. Under these circumstances, even language\n\
    can become a barrier to technological innovation, since most technologies are\
    \ developed\nin English, a language not spoken by small producers in developing\
    \ countries [31]. This\nbarrier for small producers favors large agribusiness\
    \ companies that have workers trained\nto use technologies and apply them to increase\
    \ large-scale production quality. In addition,\nthere is a major digital infrastructure\
    \ problem in many developing countries, which are\ngradually developing ways to\
    \ bring digital devices and applications at low cost to small\nproducers to increase\
    \ proﬁtability and production quality. This concern is evident in the\nrelationship\
    \ between smallholder farmers and CSA (Figure 4b), which also appears to be\n\
    related to discussions of gender and female management in agriculture.\nThe motor\
    \ theme of the ﬁeld of study, the Internet of Things, appears related to\nsecurity\
    \ and blockchain (Figure 4c), highlighting that technological advances bring also\n\
    complex data security and privacy issues. Concerns about information, conﬁdentiality\n\
    and data integrity are major challenges that concern farmers [182]. In highly\
    \ technological\nscenarios, these concerns increase the efforts of researchers\
    \ and practitioners in the search\nfor better encryption and security techniques\
    \ to reduce the risks of cyber-attacks and ensure\ndata security and privacy [183].\
    \ According to Zhang et al. (2020) [184], farmers are highly\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 7889\n18 of 28\nconcerned about data security and the physical requirements\
    \ for equipment and practical\ntools for data protection and distributed systems\
    \ for agricultural management. Hussein\n(2019) [183] reviews the requirement of\
    \ the computational infrastructure necessary for\ncloud storage to be effective\
    \ and secure. This and other studies highlight the concern\nwith agile software\
    \ development, data security, conﬁdentiality, and reliability to guarantee\nfair\
    \ competition, differential privacy, economic development, sustainable innovation,\
    \ and\nsocial entrepreneurship in agriculture.\nIn this sense, two major strands\
    \ of challenges can be considered: the ﬁrst strand is\nabout technical challenges,\
    \ such as the mastery and the adaptation of technological tools\nto direct them\
    \ in the best possible way for optimal gains. These challenges are evident\nthrough\
    \ technologies that are subthemes of thematic network structures, such as Machine\n\
    Learning and Deep Learning, drones, cloud computing, big data, blockchain, Artiﬁcial\n\
    Intelligence, artiﬁcial neural networks, computer vision, and others (Figure 4).\
    \ The second\nstrand is related to sustainability issues, such as the continuous\
    \ world population growth\nand global warming (mainly due to the greenhouse effect,\
    \ or gas emissions) and their\nharmful effects on agriculture [185]. Discussions\
    \ related to these challenges are represented\nby subthemes, such as food security,\
    \ conservation agriculture, climate change adaptation,\nagroforestry, vegetation\
    \ indices, resilience, and mitigation.\nMoreover, it is crucial to keep in mind\
    \ that, although many authors discuss the\ntechnological potential for promoting\
    \ sustainable development, other authors discuss\nthe paradox of sustainability\
    \ [186] by raising questions about the contradictions between\neconomic growth\
    \ and sustainable development that mainly negatively affect the low-\nincome populations\
    \ [187]. In the same perspective, the technological paradox regards the\nlack\
    \ of evidence about technological beneﬁts in terms of productivity and sustainability\
    \ of\norganizations and society [188]. These controversies between authors show\
    \ that discussions\nabout these paradoxes in agriculture are not yet sufﬁciently\
    \ developed and addressed, and\nthat future research should explore this topic\
    \ in-depth [52].\n5.2. Opportunities for Research and Practice\nThe primary sector\
    \ is crucial for human survival and is full of challenges. In this\nscenario,\
    \ the technological potential can be exploited to meet the food needs of the human\n\
    population without damaging the environment [52]. The number of studies associated\
    \ with\nsustainable agriculture shows that technological adoption can develop\
    \ resilient agriculture\nthat integrates the various (economic, environmental,\
    \ and societal) pillars. Previous re-\nsearch related to the motor theme of CSA\
    \ explored the adaptation of agricultural methods\nto develop adaptive agriculture\
    \ for plantations, landscapes and forests while addressing\nclimate issues and\
    \ food security [91,92]. Regenerative and circular agriculture explores\nways\
    \ to avoid using chemicals and to rather utilize methods to develop natural pro-\n\
    cesses to protect the soil, the environment, and people through the production\
    \ of healthier\nfoods [189]. Figure 4 highlights this through subthemes, such\
    \ as food security, soil fertility\nand related properties/topics. These subthemes\
    \ also help us identify the main crops where\nthe technology is being implemented\
    \ and discussed in the literature, such as sugarcane,\ncotton, potatoes, maize,\
    \ and grape (viticulture). Thus, the formulation and adoption of\nnew technologies\
    \ based on the circular economy principles (reduce, reuse, recycle) can\nboost\
    \ the sustainability, digitalization, and integration of agriculture with other\
    \ links of the\nagribusiness value chains, a promising opportunity for further\
    \ advancement of the ﬁeld.\nAdvances in agricultural production are crucial for\
    \ increasing production and im-\nproving logistics performance and traceability\
    \ of agricultural data in the coming years [52].\nAlthough big machines favor\
    \ agricultural monopolies, small technologies, such as sensors,\nactuators, and\
    \ drones can be developed at a lower cost and with features to assist small\n\
    farmers in collecting and analyzing crop variability data [11]. Other technologies,\
    \ such\nas smart grids can assist in the development of integrated energy networks\
    \ that facilitate\nthe management of crops at lower costs [190]. Digital Agriculture\
    \ depends on techno-\nlogical progress, and a viable path for future research\
    \ concerns strategic foresight [191]\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n19 of 28\nand analysis\
    \ of innovation capabilities [192,193] to assist in the development of techno-\n\
    logical innovations in smart agriculture. Our results are presented in the evolutionary\n\
    map (Figure 5) with the emergence of themes such as thermal imaging, red edge,\
    \ spraying\nequipment, NDVI, and technology adoption.\nDigital Agriculture can\
    \ promote and foster changes, revolutions, transformations, and\ngains, both for\
    \ society and sustainability, as well as for economic agents through the im-\n\
    provements in scale and efﬁciency of the digitization of agriculture. Within this\
    \ framework,\nif drones and IoT are more connected to companies and businesses,\
    \ CSA has an important\nimpact on inclusive and sustainable agriculture. The existing\
    \ scholarly literature presents\nseveral techniques and technological solutions\
    \ aimed at ensuring environmental protection\nand economic and social sustainability\
    \ (see Figure 5, e.g., hyperspectral, thermal imaging,\nspatial variability, proximal\
    \ soil sensing, and CSA, among others), which represent both\ntechnological and\
    \ sustainable revolutions in the primary sector. This may motivate a cycle\nof\
    \ sustainable production and consumption to transform the planet and society.\
    \ According\nto Ofori and El-Gayar (2020) [31], the main drivers for technological\
    \ adoption in agribusi-\nness are related to governance, policies, trade opportunities,\
    \ effects on human capital,\nemployment opportunities and environmental protection.\
    \ In this perspective, traditional\nagriculture is no longer sufﬁcient to meet\
    \ the demand for food, quality, sustainability\nand safety of the environment,\
    \ and a new paradigm is needed, namely the technological\nparadigm [194].\nTo\
    \ create a technological and sustainable culture, agriculture depends on the en-\n\
    gagement of various members of society, such as universities, farmers, companies,\
    \ the\ncommunity and the government. In this sense, the topic of creation of an\
    \ innovation\necosystem has been little explored in the literature and presents\
    \ an opportunity for future\nresearch. The participation of universities is crucial\
    \ for developing technologies and re-\nsearch aimed at modeling and developing\
    \ methods and techniques that assist farmers in\nmanaging agricultural processes.\
    \ Governmental programs and ﬁnancing can help in the\ndigital transformation of\
    \ agriculture in developing countries, promoting the production\nand consumption\
    \ of sustainable products, less waste and awareness of recycling. In this\nperspective,\
    \ innovation ecosystems can be explored in-depth for the digital and sustainable\n\
    transformation of the primary sector. The adoption of new technologies enables\
    \ the trans-\nformation of value chains into digital ecosystems, potentially integrating\
    \ organizations and\nstakeholders, beneﬁting each participant in the ecosystem\
    \ [195]. As in industries, in agri-\nculture, value ecosystems can directly impact\
    \ economic performance and business agility.\nTo do this, national innovation\
    \ systems can assist in transferring knowledge between\nindustries and universities\
    \ [196,197], facilitating the development of digital innovation.\nIn addition,\
    \ the number of startups focused on agribusiness is growing, and they are\ndeveloping\
    \ technologies at a lower cost that meet the needs of small and medium farmers.\n\
    All of this can help, in particular, small producers, who are responsible for\
    \ a large portion of\nthe world’s population’s food production, and who are affected\
    \ the most by the challenges\nof agricultural revolutions. Technologies, such\
    \ as big data, facilitate the collection and\nanalysis of large volumes of data,\
    \ and IoT, through its small sensors and actuators, can\nbe used in any type of\
    \ setting/environment. In addition, cybersecurity can be exploited\nto address\
    \ farmers’ fear of data protection and security. Altogether these approaches can\n\
    facilitate the digital transformation of agriculture in different scenarios and\
    \ for different\nsizes of agricultural producers.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this research,\
    \ we presented the strategic themes and the scientiﬁc evolution struc-\nture of\
    \ Digital Agriculture. With the PICOC protocol and the SciMAT software it was\n\
    possible to map and identify the strategic themes of the ﬁeld of study, which\
    \ are mainly\nassociated with technologies and sustainable development, such as\
    \ IoT, UAV, GPS, spatial\nvariability, and CSA. In addition, the evolution map\
    \ divides the literature into three subpe-\nriods of time, listing the most important\
    \ themes at each stage of development of digital\nSensors 2021, 21, 7889\n20 of\
    \ 28\ntransformation in agriculture. The main challenges associated with digital\
    \ technological\nadoption were identiﬁed, mainly related to the complexity of\
    \ technologies, agricultural\nculture and adaptation, data security/safety/integrity\
    \ and environmental issues [198,199].\nIn addition, we identiﬁed the main opportunities\
    \ of technological adoption and research\nin agribusiness that are strongly related\
    \ to creating a technological and smart value chain\nto increase the productivity,\
    \ quality, and proﬁtability of agricultural production, while\npromoting and ensuring\
    \ economic, societal, and environmental sustainability. Thus, we be-\nlieve to\
    \ have covered a major gap in the existing scholarly literature related to the\
    \ evolution\nof the digitalization of agriculture and its strategic themes over\
    \ time.\nLimitations and Further Research\nDespite its contribution, methodological\
    \ rigor and high-quality, as well as trans-\nparency, and reproducibility, this\
    \ research has limitations that should be properly acknowl-\nedged. This study\
    \ explored only documents from the Web of Science database, and we\nanalyzed only\
    \ the thematic structures of the motor themes, and as such other themes\nshould\
    \ be addressed in future works. It is important to keep in mind that agriculture\n\
    directly impacts socioeconomic conditions and environmental sustainability. Thus,\
    \ a more\ncomprehensive qualitative analysis could be realized in terms of the\
    \ implications of Digital\nAgriculture for sustainability and societal development.\
    \ The role of emerging technologies\nto promote food security and the impact of\
    \ food production on society and organizations\nneed to be explored. Future research\
    \ can explore in-depth agricultural management prac-\ntices focused on CSA, sustainable\
    \ and lean agriculture to identify and analyze sustainable\nproduction paths.\
    \ In addition, scenarios and frameworks for smart agriculture imple-\nmentation\
    \ should be explored. Future research could map the ﬁeld of study, focusing\n\
    on speciﬁc techniques, applications, and technologies such as Big Data, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelli-\ngence, blockchain, Internet of Things, autonomous robots, NDVI, yield\
    \ prediction, image\nprocessing, etc. Future studies could explore each theme\
    \ and subtheme not covered in\nthis research to discover hidden and emerging themes\
    \ in the ﬁeld of study, such as those\nrelated to subsectors of PA, like PH, CEA,\
    \ VF, PAF and Precision Aquaculture/Fisheries.\nMoreover, further additional analyses\
    \ could be performed, stratifying ﬁndings based on\nthe speciﬁc study design of\
    \ the investigation (original research, overview/review, etc.)\nand gradating/assessing\
    \ its strength of evidence. Innovation ecosystems need also to be\nexamined by\
    \ involving organizations, government, and universities to integrate and digi-\n\
    tize processes. Future works can also explore technological and sustainability\
    \ paradoxes\nto identify the real potential of technologies in agriculture and\
    \ the challenges related to\ntheir contradictions to better understand whether\
    \ human decisions about food production\nare moving in the right direction or\
    \ are causing an ecological collapse unrecoverable on\nthe planet.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ Every aspect of the 21st century has undergone a revolution because of the Internet\
    \ of\nThings (IoT) and smart computing technologies. These technologies are applied\
    \ in many different\nways, from monitoring the state of crops and the moisture\
    \ level of the soil in real-time to using\ndrones to help with chores such as\
    \ spraying pesticides. The extensive integration of both recent\nIT and conventional\
    \ agriculture has brought in the phase of agriculture 4.0, often known as smart\n\
    agriculture. Agriculture intelligence and automation are addressed by smart agriculture.\
    \ However,\nwith the advancement of agriculture brought about by recent digital\
    \ technology, information security\nchallenges cannot be overlooked. The article\
    \ begins by providing an overview of the development of\nagriculture 4.0 with\
    \ pros and cons. This study focused on layered architectural design, identiﬁed\n\
    security issues, and presented security demands and upcoming prospects. In addition\
    \ to that, we\npropose a security architectural framework for agriculture 4.0\
    \ that combines blockchain technology,\nfog computing, and software-deﬁned networking.\
    \ The suggested framework combines Ethereum\nblockchain and software-deﬁned networking\
    \ technologies on an open-source IoT platform. It is then\ntested with three different\
    \ cases under a DDoS attack. The results of the performance analysis show\nthat\
    \ overall, the proposed security framework has performed well.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ blockchain; SDN; precision farming; cyber security; fog computing\n1. Introduction\n\
    Farming is the main source of food and contributes signiﬁcantly to the economy.\n\
    According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),\
    \ by 2050,\nthe demand for producing food must be increased by 70% to satisfy\
    \ the world’s demand.\nIn recent studies, 550 million people of the world’s population\
    \ are in nutrition deﬁciencies;\nevery day, around 820 million people are still\
    \ not obtaining food. The study says that\nthe world’s population will increase\
    \ to more than two billion, and most of the population\nwill live in cities. It\
    \ has also been observed that the population in India and Nigeria will\nincrease\
    \ to around 482 million between 2019 and 2050 [1].\nThe biggest challenging situation\
    \ arises with this population growth to achieve the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) of zero hunger [2]. These projections for the near\nfuture have an impact\
    \ on overall food demand. Because of the scarcity of water today, it is\nProcesses\

    \ by 2030, and the unavailability of farming\nland will lead to a reduction in\
    \ the food supply. As a result, the agriculture sector needs\nsufﬁcient resources\
    \ than are presently available, as well as more self-sustaining systems\nto boost\
    \ cultivation percentages while reducing environmental resource use [3]. Though\n\
    it might be appropriate to reach rising demand, it is unclear how to do so in\
    \ an equitable\nand resilient manner. Again, there is a vital need to accelerate\
    \ and scale up the agricultural\nproduction transformation [4]. Agriculture 4.0\
    \ can provide a way to increase agricultural\nefﬁciency with the available crop\
    \ area. It also optimizes irrigation to use limited water and\nenergy and allocate\
    \ resources to protect crops effectively. Those would be possible through\nthe\
    \ integration of environmental monitoring, forecasting, and smart devices [5].\
    \ Smart\nfarming’s new technologies can enhance agricultural mechanisms, allowing\
    \ cultivation\nto increase while using natural resources efﬁciently. Agricultural\
    \ sector innovations are\nreferred to as the “digital agricultural revolution”,\
    \ which turns most factors of agriculture,\nensuing in more effective, efﬁcient,\
    \ self-sustaining, integrated, truthful, and self-reliant\nagriculture. Cellular\
    \ devices, sensors, data analysis, fog computing, information security,\nand intelligent\
    \ systems inﬂuence how technologies are integrated into the agricultural\nsector\
    \ [6].\nNowadays, agriculture is changing quickly as it enters a new age known\
    \ as Agriculture\n4.0. Agriculture 4.0 seeks to employ new technology and approaches\
    \ to address the issues\nfacing modern agriculture (such as climatic alteration,\
    \ illnesses, extreme application of\nresources, etc.) and to lower risks while\
    \ enhancing production efﬁciency and safety [7]. To\ndo this, it makes extensive\
    \ use of cutting-edge ICTs.\nIn addition to this evolution, there is a rising\
    \ trend in food needs. Given the continual\nevolution and the rising need for\
    \ food, it is anticipated that the market for agriculture 4.0\nwill expand greatly\
    \ in the years to come.\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) technologies are\nwidely utilized in Agriculture 4.0 and provide farmers\
    \ with a number of advantages,\nincluding observing numerous environmental factors\
    \ connected to crops, spotting crop\nillnesses, predicting yield, and lowering\
    \ labor costs [8]. However, the Sensor and network\nconnectivity and communications\
    \ in farming might act as a base factor for many types of\nattacks since these\
    \ devices frequently have obsolete or unpatched ﬁrmware or software [9].\nSecurity\
    \ is a top priority in agriculture, and any interruption or distortion may present\n\
    difﬁcult problems and have disastrous outcomes. Monitoring and categorization\
    \ of net-\nwork trafﬁc, which have attracted a lot of attention since the earliest\
    \ beginnings of the\nInternet, can be crucial to preventing network assaults [10].\
    \ Scientiﬁc research on network\ntrafﬁc categorization for IoT system security\
    \ has been extensive. It is an essential part of\nintrusion detection systems\
    \ (IDS) and aids in the identiﬁcation and detection of harmful\nnetwork activity.\n\
    This revolution in agricultural technology is built on having access to all the\
    \ data\nproduced by every sensor used on a farm, centralized via the internet,\
    \ and analyzed for the\nbest possible decision-making [11]. Any sensor employed\
    \ generates a signiﬁcant amount\nof data that can be extensively examined and\
    \ provides useful information to enhance crop\nquality or lessen environmental\
    \ impact. Cloud computing, physical hardware, and the\nIoT are the three key components\
    \ that enable the automation and data sharing needed by\nthis new smart agriculture\
    \ [12]. With the help of technical improvements (drones, sensors,\nsoftware, etc.),\
    \ we can complete agricultural jobs faster and more effectively than humans.\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 must make sure that an appropriate security mechanism is imple-\n\
    mented to avert an attack to build scalable and secure systems. The integrity\
    \ of data is\nimportant for the effective functioning of information technological\
    \ advances such as data\nanalysis and intelligent devices [13]. Because agriculture\
    \ 4.0 incorporates elements from\nconventional Internet, cellular, and wireless\
    \ technologies, which may include all of the\nsecurity risks that advancements\
    \ present situation. It also addresses current security risks\nsuch as data and\
    \ device integrity, consistency, and accessibility. Devices in agriculture 4.0\n\
    are implemented in outdoor spaces where they are subjected to external factors\
    \ such as ani-\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n3 of 27\nmals, human beings, or farming\
    \ equipment. Unknowingly, these factors remove or damage\nsensors. Since the 6th\
    \ century B.C., there has been a threat known as Agro terrorism [5].\nThis type\
    \ of terrorism could have a variety of goals, including causing ﬁnancial harm,\
    \ fear,\nand social unrest [6,7]. Terrorists could incite community disturbance\
    \ and lack of credibility\nin administration by exploiting agricultural and food\
    \ corporate crises, which can lead to\nundivided attention in the world. Cyber-agro-terrorism\
    \ in agriculture 4.0 is an electronic\nsystem in agricultural settings to harm\
    \ crops and animals while causing economic loss.\nCyber-agro-terrorists can operate\
    \ attacks on ﬁelds and through the internet, using cyber\nresources [8].\n2. Overview\

    4 of 27\nAgriculture 1.0: During the conventional agricultural age (1784–1870),\
    \ which was\ndominated by animal and human resources, the fundamental problem\
    \ with agriculture\nwas its lack of operational efﬁciency.\nAgriculture 2.0: During\
    \ the automated agricultural period of the 20th century, resource\nwaste was the\
    \ major problem.\nAgriculture 3.0: During the period of rapid advancement of automated\
    \ agriculture\n(1992–2017), the key problem was the lack of intelligence.\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0: the age of smart agriculture (which began in 2017 and is deﬁned\nby unmanned\
    \ operations) is primarily characterized by the application of contemporary\n\
    information technology to both support and intelligently improve agriculture.\n\
    The term “smart agriculture” [15] refers to a new approach to agriculture that\
    \ per-\nsonalized service through the integration of contemporary information\
    \ technologies such\nas the internet, big data, IoT, and many more [16]. In a\
    \ nutshell, the new mode is an\nintelligent agricultural solution that fuses current\
    \ information technology with agriculture.\nAlthough recent information technology\
    \ opens up new possibilities for the progress of\nagricultural output, it also\
    \ places heavy demands on security and privacy in the context of\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and poses signiﬁcant obstacles therein [17].\nMore than a movement, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 represents the next development in the sector’s\ntransition to a more intelligent,\
    \ effective, and environmentally responsible one. The supply\nchain’s daily operations\
    \ produce a tremendous amount of data [18]. Most of the time, this\ninformation\
    \ went unused, but thanks to big data and new technology, it can now be used\n\
    to boost any crop’s performance and productivity.\n2.1. Advantages of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\nThe effects of smart agriculture are covered in the following sections.\n\
    Production volume: The use of smart technology in agriculture can signiﬁcantly\n\
    boost the number of products produced on the farm. This will contribute to feeding\
    \ a\ngrowing population.\nProduction quality: The wellness and nutrition of people\
    \ from all socioeconomic strata\nin the nation can be signiﬁcantly impacted by\
    \ the quality of food produced. A country’s\npopulation will live longer and in\
    \ better health with better food, which will improve its\ncitizens’ economic contribution.\n\
    Effectiveness of farming practices and resource use: The application of smart\
    \ technolo-\ngies to conventional agricultural operations can increase their effectiveness.\
    \ In turn, this\nencourages more efﬁcient use of agricultural resources.\nIdeal\
    \ cost of cultivation: It is achieved when there is a balance between quantity,\
    \ quality,\nand efﬁciency in the procedures used. This results in a higher price\
    \ for the agricultural\noutput that is produced.\nReducing wastage: The farming\
    \ industry, one of the main economic sectors, is in great\npart to blame for the\
    \ massive quantities of food and other secondary resources that are\nwasted. Smart\
    \ technology could be employed to track and cut down on this waste.\nEcologically\
    \ sustainable: The reduced agricultural waste and improved agricultural\nprocess\
    \ efﬁciency directly reduce the environmental and ecological footprint.\nEffective\
    \ use of Time: Timely delivery of the necessary insecticides, fertilizers, and\n\
    other chemicals can provide timely and high-quality agricultural output with fewer\
    \ losses\nthanks to smart agriculture.\nThe farming industry may be at threat\
    \ by the following while deploying agricultural\n4.0 technology:\n•\nTheft of\
    \ business and customer data.\n•\nTaking resources under the control of sensors\
    \ and gadgets.\n•\nDestroying the objects that devices control.\n•\nDamage to\
    \ reputation if a data breach is disclosed.\nAgriculture 4.0 may be at risk from\
    \ infrastructure damage, sensor failures may affect\npoultry and cattle breeding,\
    \ and control system hacks may affect greenhouse farming. All\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n5 of 27\nof these could cause problems or malfunction in agricultural\
    \ operations by harming the\nIoT architecture’s hardware and software. In addition,\
    \ data-collecting technologies face\nchallenges from malicious assaults, unauthorized\
    \ access, privacy breaches, and other issues.\nThe landscape has shifted, with\
    \ AI and ML research concentrating on agro-based\ncontexts, water management,\
    \ livestock, and farmlands. Monitoring, control, and decision-\nmaking alternatives\
    \ in the irrigation ﬁeld repeatedly tried to save water and enhance\nproductivity\
    \ [8–13]. Some research concentrated on plant leaf disease [14], horticulture\
    \ [15],\nvineyards [16], hydroponic [17], alert facilities [18], integration of\
    \ IoT technological innova-\ntions [19], tracking resources [20], and cloud control\
    \ [21].\n2.2. IoT in Agriculture 4.0\nTable 1 lists several well-known uses of\

    \ The ﬁnal product is greatly\ninﬂuenced by the quantity and quality of the groundwater.\
    \ As a result, this system uses\nIoT approaches to maintain appropriate groundwater\
    \ levels.\nThough there are many smart agriculture alternatives, they are still\
    \ underdeveloped\nand offer a low degree of intellect. Many initiatives are limited\
    \ in their automated systems,\nwith the internet of things sending data to the\
    \ base station [53]. There is also no implemen-\ntation with the Internet in several\
    \ cases, except that in a few cases, data is stored in the\ncloud by the local\
    \ systems.\nThe multi-layer architecture of IoT used in agriculture 4.0 consists\
    \ of four layers,\nwhich are the physical layer, network layer, edge layer, and\
    \ application layer. Table 2 below\ngives a detailed description of Resources\

    \ from the farming ﬁeld and digitizes them using\nan Analog to Digital converter\
    \ (ADC). As the equipment at the physical layer does not\ncompute and store the\
    \ data, this needs to connect with the edge layer through the network\nlayer.\
    \ The edge layer includes various resources such as decision-making, gateway,\
    \ data\nﬁlters, data security, and interfaces [55].\nThe advancement of devices\
    \ and technological developments will allow for the in-\ncorporation of more computer\
    \ capabilities into systems. This type of integration aims to\nmeet the various\
    \ needs of agricultural mechanization, farming techniques, and sustainable\nagriculture\
    \ [56,57]. A further issue is data security. This is very important to focus on\n\
    data privacy, the trustworthiness of data, and the correctness of data from generation\
    \ to\ndecision-making.\n2.3. Research Motivation\nThree factors serve as inspiration\
    \ for this article:\n1.\nSmart agriculture is a new paradigm that integrates information\
    \ technology with\nconventional farming as a result of the low productivity of\
    \ traditional agriculture\nand the extensive usage of information technology.\
    \ It has the potential to become the\nnext big thing in agricultural development.\
    \ Consequently, it is crucial to outline the\ncurrent manufacturing model and\
    \ particular studies [58].\n2.\nDespite substantial research on smart agriculture,\
    \ less has been conducted in compar-\nison to industrial security solutions to\
    \ analyze security problems.\n3.\nIt is crucial to examine the features of security\
    \ concerns in relation to situations\ninvolving smart agriculture [59]. This article\
    \ attempts to give a review of the security\nchallenges raised by smart agriculture\
    \ in light of the aforementioned variables, which\ninevitably results in a signiﬁcant\
    \ number of open research questions.\n2.4. Research Contributions\nThe research\

    \ with physical equipment such as sensors and actuators.\nPhysical devices can\
    \ fail due to unintentional or intentional human behavior, viruses,\nspyware,\
    \ or cyber-attacks. Smart farming applications use a wide range of sensors and\n\
    technologies, and this diversity opens up several security risks, including the\
    \ following:\nRandom device incidents: This is the unintended alteration of physical\
    \ equipment\nthat causes it to deviate from its normal performance. The physical\
    \ equipment may be\ndamaged by farm machinery, causing short- or long-term physical\
    \ damage, as a result,\ngenerates false data and affects data accessibility.\n\
    Mobile node hijacking: It is the theft of farm equipment such as tractors, drones,\
    \ and\nsowing robots. Drones can indeed be pesticides, fertilizers sprinkling\
    \ could be performed\nby Drone, and robots could do weeding detecting disease.\
    \ The intruder may access and\nuse the farm equipment remotely without having\
    \ access permission.\nFake node: An intruder introduces imitation or harmful nodes\
    \ into the automated\nagriculture ﬁeld to disturb the smooth functioning of the\
    \ system [55]. This attack could be\ntriggered by capturing a node and making\
    \ a replica of it. This type of attack typically aims\nto either alter or modify\
    \ data-shuttered devices and applications.\nAbnormal Measurement: It senses unusual\
    \ observations due to data falsiﬁcation,\nenergy exhaustion, radio radiation,\
    \ detection of various connections, extreme storms,\nmalfunctions, or wrong inputs.\
    \ Incorrect data can jeopardize making decisions that result\nin the analysis\
    \ of data will be inaccurate, which minimizes system correctness.\nSleeplessness\
    \ attack: The sleeplessness attack sends a series of seemingly legitimate\nrequests\
    \ in order to keep the devices awake for prolonged life. As a result, the device’s\n\
    battery runs out, and the device stops working [56,57]. When the devices are turned\n\
    off, the observed information is not properly sent, jeopardizing decision-making\
    \ and\nsystem efﬁciency.\n3.2. Security Risks at Network Layer\nThe objective\
    \ of this layer is to send the generated data by the sensors from the physical\n\
    layer to the most trustable computational unit, which is the cloud. The most common\n\
    attacks, which affect the resources used in the network layer, are focused on\
    \ [58,59]. The\nsecurity risks in network layers are:\nDistributed Denial of Service\
    \ (DDoS): It attempts to affect access to service providers\nby overburdening\
    \ the communication link or manipulating protocol ﬂaws, which cause\nresources,\
    \ such as CPU and memory collapse [60].\nDue to resource exhaustion brought on\
    \ by a DDoS attack, the victim server is forced\nto block connections from new\
    \ reliable clients. The victim server’s buffer capacity or\nbandwidth may have\
    \ reached its limit of resources. The overall probability of resource\nscarcity\
    \ at the target end is provided by Equation (1) [15].\nPAttack = 1 − (1 − PBandwidth)\n\
    \01 − Pmemory\n\x01\n(1)\nwhere,\nPAttack: Probability of total attack,\nPBandwidth:\
    \ Probability of Consumption of bandwidth\nPmemory: Probability of Consumption\
    \ of memory\nAttacks on Data Transit: These types of attacks aim to retrieve information\
    \ shared\nbetween network devices in order to obtain conﬁdential information [61].\
    \ An adversary\ncould intercept trafﬁc via malicious routers or man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks [62]. Intercep-\ntion of trafﬁc reveals conﬁdential data such as private\
    \ keys, access credentials, or digital\nsignatures.\nAttacks on Routers: They\
    \ plan to change network routes in order to gain trafﬁc control.\nInimical nodes\
    \ in IoT networks might attempt to reroute communicating paths during the\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757\n10 of 27\nprocess of transmission. As a result of attacks, the\
    \ receiver might receive information lately,\npartially, or incorrectly, or not\
    \ at all [63,64].\nMalware Injection Attacks: The malware injection attack [34],\
    \ in which malware is\ninjected by an attacker into a connected computing device.\
    \ This is a very common attack\non smart farming. Malware is a very signiﬁcant\
    \ threat in distributed projects because it\nautomatically spreads through the\
    \ system, making it an appealing target for intruders.\nMalware damage comes in\
    \ multiple varieties of sizes. Malware can steal data about farm\nmaterial usage,\
    \ buying information for fruits, vegetables, and farm animals, data about\nfarm\
    \ equipment, and so on. It could hire automated devices to form a botnet that\
    \ would be\nused to commit harmful attacks under the inﬂuence of an intruder.\n\
    Botnet: At each architectural layer of the precision farming system, there are\
    \ numer-\nous IoT devices. These machines are vulnerable to attack and could be\
    \ taken over by a\ncentralized malicious system. This results in a ‘Botnet of\
    \ Things’ (BoT) [35]. A mutant farm\nworkforce IoT equipment that is already infected\
    \ [36] is easily used to infect other networks\nvia various communication links,\
    \ and thus automated farming could become an internet of\ndestructibility for\
    \ cyber illegitimates. The security features are not added in many of the\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture devices, but still, they are used frequently for establishing adequate\n\
    data security defensive system frameworks.\n3.3. Security Risks at Edge Layer\n\
    The edge contains important aspects that monitor, and control modules communicate\n\
    with all layers and access resources. The physical layer’s large volumes of data\
    \ can be\nprocessed locally rather than centralized in the cloud. The following\
    \ are major edge\nsecurity issues.\nActuator control Forge: It introduces false\
    \ measures of data into the system in order to\nmanipulate it. Typically, the\
    \ data is received by the gateway in plain text. Corrupted data\nwill lead to\
    \ poor decision-making. An opponent, for example, could inject incorrect soil\n\
    moisture measurements into a smart irrigation system to manipulate it.\nBooting\
    \ Attacks: Devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of security processes\n\
    during boot [37]. Memory cards and ﬂash drive sticks, for example, may detect\
    \ dangerous\ncodes which run at startup [38]. Suspicious booting practices could\
    \ launch numerous\nattacks on the edge with insufﬁcient protection.\nSignature\
    \ wrapping: The attacker modulates the cipher text by inserting a bogus\nelement\
    \ that allows you to perform a random Web Application requisition while identifying\n\
    as an authenticated user [39].\nMeasure infusion Forgery: It is the injection\
    \ of wrong speciﬁcations into a system in\norder to modify it. An attacker sends\
    \ known data patterns through actuators to the cloud\nstorage, which is then injected\
    \ into the system through computational units. Corrupted\ndata could lead to poor\
    \ decision-making.\nUnauthorized access: The process of validating is a critical\
    \ security component. The\nauthentication process is a technology that ensures\
    \ security and privacy, honesty, and\naccessibility [40]. Several agricultural\
    \ practices, however, use gateways with insufﬁcient or\nno access controls.\n\
    Gateway-cloud fabrication: The cloud and the gateway are linked by ISPs or wireless\n\
    connections. A network attacker could fabricate cloud requests by interrogating\
    \ a gateway.\nThe attacker could use these requests to change parameters in precision\
    \ agriculture, control\nqueries for sensitive services, or interpret system equipment.\
    \ The cloud can implement\nsecurity services as it has computational power. In\
    \ order to ensure maximum system\nreliability, these strategies must be incorporated\
    \ into the system.\n3.4. Security Risks at Application Layer\nThis layer provides\
    \ end-user assistance and data to process and make system decisions.\nThis layer’s\
    \ security concerns are application-speciﬁc, focusing on preventing data theft\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n11 of 27\nand ensuring privacy. Some of the attacks that\
    \ might affect cloud services and applications\nare listed below in terms of security.\n\
    Malicious scripts: Malicious scripts can deceive clients, infuse malicious data,\
    \ access\nconﬁdential material, and compromise security features. This type of\
    \ attack is frequently\ncarried out by cybercriminals for speciﬁc, economic, or\
    \ political reasons. They can damage\nor destabilize operational processes by\
    \ using malicious scripts, presenting unnecessary ad\ncampaigns, and stealing\
    \ money [41].\nPhishing: It is an attack that attempts to obtain highly classiﬁed\
    \ personal informa-\ntion, such as an Identity and password, fraudulently. Phishing\
    \ typically targets end-users\nthrough fraud and sites [42]. The attacker also\
    \ affects decision-making and internal opera-\ntions in many cases. The most effective\
    \ protection would be for users to remain vigilant\nwhile surﬁng the web [43].\n\
    Denial of Service (DoS): This threat disrupts service by overburdening trafﬁc\
    \ on the\nnetwork or ﬂooding the provider with repeated attempts [44]. Because\
    \ of ﬂaws in security\nsetup, an attacker can launch this attack from the Web\
    \ or a sub-system.\n4. Security Threats in Modern Agriculture\nFarmers typically\
    \ carry out the developed smart system initiatives in physical ﬁelds\nor green\
    \ ﬁelds. In Agriculture 4.0, most efforts are focused on water processes, disease\n\
    monitoring, seed production, and record keeping. It can be either automatically\
    \ con-\ntrolled or manually controlled. In both cases, the system monitors the\
    \ environment with\nsensors and changes it with actuators. Some initiatives only\
    \ digitize farms, whereas oth-\ners incorporate industry 4.0 or IoT technologies.\
    \ As an immature industry, open-ﬁeld\nagriculture is the focus of this work, with\
    \ security issues restricted to access control and\nweb-encrypted communications.\n\
    It is too difﬁcult to execute different security measures in rural areas since\
    \ there is a\nshortage of modern technical infrastructure and advanced technology.\
    \ Many difﬁculties\ncan arise if security measures are attempted in rural agriculture.\
    \ Table 3 lists a few of the\nsecurity challenges that are prevalent in rural\
    \ locations.\nTable 3. Rural-Agriculture Security Issues.\nRural-Agriculture\n\
    Security Issues for Rural\nResident\nsecurity awareness is less\nHard for Facing\

    \ 4.0 projects have implemented IoT, but the security\nfeatures in that have become\
    \ disabled by default. It has been introduced that a server con-\ntrols and manages\
    \ these devices remotely via a web application. Opportunistic opponents\ndid not\
    \ know details about security resources. They gain unauthorized access to the\
    \ system,\ninsert fabricated measures, fabricate actuator controls, or report\
    \ earlier attacks to divert\nthe system from its normal functioning [45–64]. The\
    \ author proposed a smart watering\nsystem that remotely controls and observes\
    \ the ﬂow of water in the farm but is not focused\non security risks to detect\
    \ malicious attacks and unallowed access that manipulate the\nmonitored data.\
    \ To monitor the growing environment, ref. [65] introduce a Hydroponic\nFarming\
    \ Ecosystem (HFE). It is automatically controlled, and the client can monitor\
    \ the\nfarming via a web interface. These automated systems require high-security\
    \ concerns to\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n12 of 27\ndetect or avoid random sensor\
    \ incidents, weak sensors, wrong data injection, and other\nattacks, which could\
    \ corrupt data and affect system reliability.\nSimilarly, in [66], the author\
    \ focused on creating a system for monitoring ﬁelds based\non humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ light levels, and temperature. Irrigation can be controlled\nmanually or automatically\
    \ via web or mobile systems. An intelligent solution for detecting\ndiseases in\
    \ leaves focused in [67]. By using sensor data and camera images, the system\n\
    identiﬁes leaf diseases. A mobile or web application is used by the end-user to\
    \ interact\nwith the system. This paper does not go into detail about the implementation\
    \ of security.\nSimilarly, ref. [68] proposed an intelligent agricultural system\
    \ for information inter-\nchange among farm equipment. The article discusses the\
    \ system’s construction but makes\nno mention of manual intervention or remote\
    \ control, nor does it concern any security\nchallenges. As this is a data exchange\
    \ system, the DoS attack can affect the network layer.\nRef. [69] provides NETPIE,\
    \ a solution that gives agricultural product information. The\ngrowing environment\
    \ can be controlled and monitored with a set of physical devices. The\ngenerated\
    \ data is analyzed saved in a QR code, and which is then available to the customer.\n\
    NETPIE does not discuss security resources. Ref. [51] Introduced monitoring of\
    \ crop ﬁelds\nand watering using IoT, which measures data and controls data to\
    \ avoid unauthorized\naccess to these data but could not protect the other devices,\
    \ which leads to weak security,\nwhich might result in a major loss. Ref. [52]\
    \ Proposed a system known as SEnviro, which\nobserves the crop ﬁeld and detects\
    \ diseases remotely. This system does not focus on the\nprediction of disease,\
    \ but unauthorized access is controlled here.\nAccording to the relevant literature,\
    \ from a security standpoint, farming equipment\nis used without security features.\
    \ Furthermore, the gateway contains no security infor-\nmation. Transmission privacy\
    \ or device authentication is not presented in any of the\nabove-discussed systems.\
    \ Access control and management and encryption of data need\nto add security technologies\
    \ to Information dissemination. Smart agriculture is currently\na convenient target\
    \ for cyber criminals’ agents. Attacks can be motivated by a variety of\nfactors,\
    \ including an advertisement, intellectual, or even terrorist reasons. Terrorist\
    \ groups,\nfor example, can cause ecological loss to a country, economic chancers\
    \ may take part in\nmarket manipulation, and workers can attack a range of factors\
    \ [53].\n4.1. Data and Device Security Issues and Threats in Agriculture 4.0\n\
    As was previously mentioned, harsh environmental factors that can seriously harm\n\
    electromechanical equipment, such as extreme heat, moisture, moisture, shocks,\
    \ and other\nanomalies, have a direct impact on the agricultural sector [70].\
    \ The majority of these\nsensors are prone to failure, making it feasible for\
    \ them to produce inaccurate data and\ninstructions that could cause a manufacturing\
    \ disaster [71]. Additionally, sensors and\nnetwork equipment are predominance\
    \ reachable. This poses a serious risk to farmlands\nsince anybody with bad intentions\
    \ can access them and corrupt or harm them to cause\nthem to malfunction [72].\n\
    Another potential security concern is the online transfer of the information gathered\n\
    by IoT sensors and other agricultural machines. Major security concern in the\
    \ agriculture\nindustry is security, privacy, and control [73], as farmers may\
    \ incur a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial\nand personal loss in the event of a data breach.\
    \ Ref. [74] Divides the threats to conﬁdentiality\ninto four distinct categories:\n\
    •\nIntentional data theft through smart platforms and applications that do not\
    \ adhere to\nsecurity and privacy standards;\n•\nInternal information thefts from\
    \ a stakeholder in the supply chain intended to harm\nan agri-business or a farmer;\n\
    •\nUnethical data sales intended to reduce proﬁts for farmers or to harm them;\
    \ and\nother threats.\n•\nUnsupervised foreign access to private and sensitive\
    \ information using drones, sensors,\nand cameras with the intention of utilizing\
    \ them to harm farmers or jeopardize public\nsafety [64,75].\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n13 of 27\nEvery application of modern technology, IoT in agriculture,\
    \ carries the aforementioned\ndangers, weaknesses, and threats. A more thorough\
    \ and complex explanation of the risks\nand their sources in aspects of cyberattacks\
    \ in the agro sector is provided in the following\nparagraph, which is primarily\
    \ focused on illegal behavior and exploited vulnerabilities in\nICT systems.\n\
    4.2. Cybercrime and Cybersecurity in Agriculture\nA cyber-attack on an agribusiness\
    \ or food industry is increasingly likely today thanks\nto automation and the\
    \ widespread use of internet-connected equipment, which give poten-\ntial (cyber)\
    \ criminals greater chances in ﬁelds that were previously too remote or difﬁcult\n\
    to physically access [61]. Consequently, a potential cyber-attack or security\
    \ problem in\nan agricultural organization could have serious human or ﬁnancial\
    \ repercussions. This\nimplies that pertinent security concerns brought about\
    \ by the widespread and ongoing\nusage of IoT, as well as the emergence of agro-terrorism,\
    \ require adequate attention, better\nequipment, and solutions [62].\nThe bulk\
    \ of system operations in the agriculture sector are network-based, and fre-\n\
    quently these systems are not protected from cyber threats, which can have substantial\n\
    ﬁnancial and security ramiﬁcations [76–86]. Five important elements, as identiﬁed\
    \ in [87],\nstrengthen these risks in the agricultural sector:\n•\nIncreasing\
    \ the farm consolidation highly depends on technology;\n•\nThe joint ventures\
    \ of the food supply chains, allow manufacturers to conduct processes\nand trade\
    \ products directly;\n•\nFood-related technologies in intelligent markets depend\
    \ on more components, which\nincreases their vulnerability to errors and malfunctions.\n\
    •\nEffective monitoring of food-related systems, social networks, and industries\
    \ in a safe,\ndynamic, and almost real-time manner is lacking, making it difﬁcult\
    \ to identify serious\ndigital and security vulnerabilities that could be the\
    \ root of signiﬁcant data breaches\nand system defects.\nDue to the heightened\
    \ risk of cybercrime, the agriculture sector may be impacted by\nsuch threats\
    \ in a number of ways. Categorize these methods as in [84]. Threats of tampering\n\
    include delivery disruption, conﬁdential information interception, formula modiﬁcation,\n\
    and delivery disruption. These risks are undoubtedly closely related to the adoption\
    \ and\napplication of technological advancements in the agriculture and food sectors.\n\
    Cooper et al. and Bogaardt et al. identify the following as the primary technical\n\
    advancement areas that are commonly used in the agri-sector and contain vulnerable\n\
    places for harmful cyber-attacks [86–88]:\n•\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID);\
    \ wireless communications (such as Wi-Fi);\n•\nSensors for the infrastructure,\
    \ soil, and crops;\n•\nDrones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);\n•\n\
    PA-speciﬁc automation solutions (such Real Time Kinematic Technology);\n•\nPortable\
    \ electronics (such as laptops, smartphones, and GPS trackers);\n•\nSmart agriculture\
    \ and vertical agriculture;\n•\nThe use of AI in conjunction with biotech and\
    \ nanotech (AI).\nTable 4 provides a summary of the study performed on different\

    [62,79,92,97,98]\n4.3. IoT Vulnerabilities, Risks, and Threats in Agriculture\n\
    IoT is made up of four main systems that make it possible to communicate between\n\
    nodes. Sensing technology, IoT gateways, cloud servers, data storage, and mobile\
    \ appli-\ncations for remote control make up an IoT system. The architectures\
    \ of IoT systems in\nagriculture come with current and new threats and vulnerabilities.\
    \ These ﬂaws can be\nlinked to IoT device hardware and software problems, communication\
    \ protocols, and also\ndata processing and storage solutions (found, for example,\
    \ in cloud infrastructures, data\ncenters, and smartphones) [2,11].\nAccording\
    \ to [99–101], the following is a concise but accurate classiﬁcation of the\n\
    primary causes of low security in the IoT:\n•\nFirmware that is not patched and/or\
    \ default passwords that have been used for a long\ntime allow for device compromise\
    \ in an IoT network.\n•\nBecause of the limited computing power of smart devices\
    \ and vendors’ efforts to\nkeep their prices low in a cutthroat market, it is\
    \ difﬁcult to incorporate complicated\ncryptographic algorithms.\n•\nFlaws in\
    \ the routing protocols used by smart devices (such as Bluetooth and ZigBee);\n\
    •\nThe Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol’s outdated, low-security version,\
    \ which is\nfrequently still in use;\n•\nConducting passive vulnerability detection\
    \ using search engines;\n•\nThe risk of assembling millions of smart devices into\
    \ a potent botnet (such as Mirai),\ngiven how simple it is to ﬁnd vulnerabilities\
    \ via internet scanning;\n•\nA general disregard for the security of smart gadgets\n\
    Finally, a variety of criteria can be used to categorize IoT vulnerabilities,\
    \ hazards, and\nthreats. These risks apply to all IoT applications, including\
    \ those in the agricultural sector.\nFirst, internal vs. external risks and passive\
    \ vs. active risks are the two basic classiﬁcation\ngroups of security concerns\
    \ in IoT systems in the agriculture sector [79].\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n15\
    \ of 27\nIoT hazards are categorized in another intriguing way using a layer-based\
    \ system.\nAccording to [22], each of the levels below integrates many technologies\
    \ that could lead\nto a variety of security threats, vulnerabilities, and/or breaches.\
    \ The application layer,\nmiddleware layer, internet layer, access gateway layer,\
    \ and edge technology layer are the\nﬁve main layers that make up the IoT architecture.\n\
    5. Existing Research on Security in Agriculture 4.0\nIn [54], the author states\
    \ that The United States Department of Homeland Security\nissued a report emphasizing\
    \ the signiﬁcance of agriculture 4.0 and the associated internet\nsecurity threat\
    \ and possible attacks.\nThe report emphasizes the information security model\
    \ of conﬁdential information,\ncredibility, and accessibility in farming. The\
    \ researchers of [55] suggested a new access\ncontrol solution that combines session\
    \ keys and public keys to speed up the encrypted\ncommunications tasks. It yields\
    \ quick and lightweight appropriate control measures\nthat are ideal for precision\
    \ agriculture communication. Ref. [56] Proposed a framework\nfor understanding\
    \ vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and their application in an\nintelligent\
    \ farming environment. The goal of the approach is to determine the level to\n\
    which intelligent farming emerging innovations are prone to cyber. It assesses\
    \ the threat\nprediction model using the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS).\n\
    Nowadays, The Blockchain is not only used in cryptocurrency but also utilized\
    \ in\nother ﬁelds and different applications such as in the medical sector, agriculture\
    \ sector,\netc. [57–59]. This article concentrated on the application of blockchain\
    \ technology to food\nsafety. For tracking and monitoring the food items and stages\
    \ of production, such as\ncultivation/breeding, raw resources, processing, transporting,\

    \ the system employs a variety of sensor-\nbased equipment to adopt sustainable\

    \ a blockchain-based easy and simple security framework for\nsmart Greenﬁeld farming.\
    \ Each IoT node can nominate the cluster member’s leader, which\nhelps to avoid\
    \ a hot spot problem if an intruder focuses on the leader node. Furthermore,\n\
    the authors discussed the security risks of their suggested scheme, which adhered\

    \ The physical layer is the primary concern\nof this system of precision agriculture,\
    \ where data are collected from sensors. These data\nare sent to a controller,\
    \ which analyses it to take action, such as activating the actuators for\nwater\
    \ sprinklers on farms. Table 5 describes some of the recent research which has\
    \ already\nbeen performed on security issues related to smart farming.\nGupta,\
    \ M et al. explained [102] the necessity of clouds applied in vehicles in this\
    \ time-\nand location-sensitive context and present an extended access control\
    \ oriented (E-ACO)\narchitecture that is pertinent to IoV. Here, they describe\
    \ using scenarios to highlight access\ncontrol needs in our vision of cloud-assisted\
    \ connected automobiles and vehicular IoT, as\nwell as approaches to various access\
    \ control models that may be applied at different tiers\nof the E-ACO architecture\
    \ and in the authorization framework.\nGupta, M et al. [103], in their work, describe\
    \ an edge infrastructure-based solution to\nV2V and V2I communication that is\
    \ safe and trustworthy in place of direct peer-to-peer\nconnection. To approve,\
    \ check, and verify the authenticity, integrity, and anonymity of\ncommunications\
    \ sent in the system, they add trusted cloudlets in this section. Along with\n\
    a proof of concept implementation of the suggested approach on the AWS IoT platform,\n\
    they also describe a formal attribute-based model for V2V and V2I communication,\
    \ known\nas AB-ITS. This cloudlet-supported architecture supports crucial use\
    \ cases such as an\naccident or ice-threat warning and other safety applications.\
    \ It supplements direct V2V or\nV2I communication.\nSontowski, S. et al. [104]\
    \ presented a DoS attack that can impair a smart farm’s\noperation by interfering\
    \ with the functioning of installed on-ﬁeld sensors. They speciﬁcally\ncovered\
    \ a Wi-Fi de-authentication attack that makes use of ﬂaws in IEEE 802.11, where\n\

    \ WiFi Deauther Monster is used to disconnect it\nfrom the network and stop sensor\
    \ data from being transferred to a distant cloud.\nThe notion of Activity-Centric\
    \ Access Control (ACAC) for smart and connected ecosys-\ntems was ﬁrst proposed\
    \ by Gupta, M. et al. in [105] and discussed in this article as a ﬁrst\nstep.\
    \ Here, they examined the idea of activity with regard to cooperative and dispersed\n\
    yet interconnected systems, identifying the many parties involved as well as the\
    \ crucial\nelements to consider when making an activity control choice. They provide\
    \ an initial\nframework for developing activity control expressions that may be\
    \ used by various smart\nobjects in the system.\nThe biggest obstacle to the growth\
    \ of cloud computing is security worries. Information\nsecurity continues to have\
    \ an impact on the market even though it raises inconveniences\nrelated to information\
    \ security. The threat of security breaches in the cloud infrastructure\nmust\
    \ be understood by clients. Cloud-computing capacity, networking, and computing\n\
    powers are brought to the edge by fog computing. One of the most critical challenges\
    \ with\nfog computing platforms is safety and security. Lightweight devices have\
    \ beneﬁted greatly\nfrom edge computing’s ability to complete difﬁcult tasks quickly,\
    \ but the technology’s hasty\ndevelopment has led to a general disregard for safety\
    \ risks in edge computing stages and\nthe applications they allow.\nIn our proposed\

    \ is to acquire meaningful information from the external\nenvironment via sensors\
    \ to take required action against it. This sensor layer has a variety\nof Sensor\
    \ nodes of various forms and sizes. As a result, they all use the same basic compo-\n\
    nents, such as input and output components, information handling units, communication\n\
    segments, and many more units for the management of power sections. To analyze\
    \ and\nstore all detected data, it is sent to the relevant fog nodes. Furthermore,\
    \ Sensor nodes\nreceive instructions to undertake agricultural operations.\n6.2.\
    \ Fog Computing Layer\nThis layer is made up of multiple fog nodes, which are\
    \ insubstantial equipment that\ncarry out processing, communication, and storing\
    \ tools to do operations that an end device\ncannot perform. Not every piece of\
    \ data that is gathered becomes processed on the cloud.\nRather, this layer hosts\
    \ all authentic analysis and latency-sensitive applications.\nVirtualization:\
    \ Recognizing that conﬁguring several devices, in the same manner,\nmight be time-consuming,\
    \ the nodes can be contained inside a Virtualized environment for\na more pleasant\
    \ setup for all subsequent fog nodes.\nAgricultural Sensor data monitoring: This\
    \ node is going to collect real-time sensing\ndata, analyze it, visualize it,\
    \ manage devices, and store some of it locally. The user can\nobtain information\
    \ from the fog layer while smoothly synchronizing cloud-directed data.\nBlock-chain\
    \ Client software: This consists of a piece of programs that is installed on\n\
    the fog node. Its primary goal is to sync authentic sensitive Sensor data to the\
    \ Blockchain.\nIt is in charge of producing transactions, batching them, and sending\
    \ them to the validator\nso that they can be aggregated into blocks and recorded\
    \ to the Blockchain.\nSimulated Switch: Additionally, this node is used as a transmitting\
    \ device with the\nsupport of virtual switch software, which provides NFV and\
    \ SDN technologies to enhance\nnetwork services by establishing the routing features\
    \ for computational extension and\ncontrol. Some network virtual functions include\
    \ security, quality of service (QoS), and\nautomated control. The main objective\
    \ is to create switching layers for virtual machine\nenvironments while continuing\
    \ to support the OpenFlow protocol [107], which allows this\nnode to interact\
    \ directly with the SDN Controller; an outstanding demonstration of such\nimplementation\
    \ is Open vSwitch, an interactive multilayered software switch.\n6.3. Distributed\
    \ Network Using SDN\nThis network is made up of numerous geologically dispersed\
    \ and SDN controllers\nlinked to it that operates as a common Networking Operating\
    \ System (NOS), combining\nnominally autonomous operations with centralized control\
    \ [108]. The main component of\nan SDN network is the SDN controller. This can\
    \ help with network monitoring by managing\nall transactions among network and\
    \ application devices, allowing it to manage and adjust\nnetwork ﬂows more efﬁciently\
    \ in response to new requirements [109]. It maintains a\nconsistent glimpse of\
    \ the network from afar, delivering data to fog nodes via one APIs and\napplication\
    \ via other APIs (MQTT, CoAP...) [109]. In addition, the SDN controller employs\n\
    a Block-chain contractor to properly secure ﬂow tables of SDN in the Block-chain,\
    \ hence\navoiding rule counterfeit.\n6.4. Block-Chain Based Network\nTo keep all\
    \ the nodes up to date, all Blockchain modules are interconnected and con-\nstantly\
    \ exchange the most updated information in the Blockchain among themselves. Smart\n\
    contracts will trigger and enforce relevant actions based on the data provided,\
    \ allowing\nfor veriﬁable transactions in the Blockchain when such circumstances\
    \ are met without the\nrequirement for third-party involvement [110,111]. The\
    \ Ethereum Blockchain platform\nserves as the foundation for the blockchain network\
    \ architecture because it provides a\nhighly ﬂexible and modular design that separates\
    \ the runtime environment as per the\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n19 of 27\napplication\
    \ domain, permitting agreements to deﬁne the business rules for the application\n\
    that are not necessary for the core system’s fundamental design.\nThe Blockchain\
    \ complete node is made up of the following components:\n1.\nNode for Validation:\
    \ This is a key component that veriﬁes batches of transactions\nbefore combining\
    \ them into blocks. It also ensures that candidate blocks are added to\nthe Blockchain\
    \ version for each node.\n2.\nBlockchain Software: it determines which transactions\
    \ or operations are permitted on\nthe block-chain and contains the following:\n\
    •\nDatabase model: it deﬁnes relevant operations and the description of the transac-\n\
    tion’s payload.\n•\nTransaction Processor: deﬁnes the business logic for different\
    \ applications, vali-\ndates batches of transactions, and modiﬁes the blockchain\
    \ system based on the\napplication’s rules.\n•\nClient: it speciﬁes the service\
    \ client functionality, which the client develops and\ndelivers to the validator.\
    \ The client also shows blockchain information.\n•\nREST API: This protocol is\
    \ used to communicate within the clients and the\ntransactions processing system.\n\
    3.\nDigital Signature: To ensure transaction integrity, the data used in the transactions\
    \ is\nhashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted using the sender’s secret key to\
    \ produce a\nsignature. The processor then validates the transaction by verifying\
    \ this signature.\n7. Case Studies and Experimental Results\nTo test the security\
    \ framework, we allowed DDoS attacks against the Blockchain\nNetwork. A distributed\
    \ denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targets websites and servers by\ndisrupting\
    \ network services. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application’s resources.\n\

    Modernization of agricultural methods is required to increase productivity levels\n\
    while conserving nature. Precision agriculture could improve farming works by\
    \ controlling\nactuators more efﬁciently, enhancing the use of resources, increasing\
    \ revenues, and mini-\nmizing expenses. In order to accomplish this objective,\
    \ IoT technologies have to incorporate\nmore computing performance, such as edge\
    \ computing, big data handling, automated\nresources, and safety features. As\
    \ limited devices sense a huge amount of data and forward\nit to the gateway or\
    \ the cloud, security requires special attention. The data must be secured\nthroughout\
    \ the agricultural system, from diagnosis to risks and inventory.\nEven though\
    \ numerous security issues may affect farming production, they still\ninclude\
    \ a few security measures. This could be because these technologies were in their\n\
    initial phases of development. For most of the points, only computing resources\
    \ are\nincorporated, and that has limited computation power. As a result, security\
    \ mechanisms\nare very rare in the current list of requirement speciﬁcations.\
    \ Reaching a higher level\nof agricultural development, on the other hand, necessitates\
    \ technologies with security\nfeatures that provide enough quality and validity\
    \ to incorporate these technologies on a\nhigh level. As precision agriculture\
    \ introduces new complexities, it also opens up new\nfuture directions in security\
    \ and other areas.\nIn this study, we suggested a security framework for the agricultural\
    \ internet of things\nthat integrates blockchain technology, fog computing, and\
    \ software-deﬁned networking.\nThe suggested architecture avoids the requirement\
    \ for simulation-based work with both\nprivate and public blockchain for communication\
    \ between SDN controllers and IoT devices.\nHere, for IoT connectivity, each SDN\
    \ controller is linked to a blockchain. SDN controllers\nare interconnected by\
    \ a network’s topology. One of the key objectives of the proposed\narchitecture\
    \ is to enhance communication security for IoT devices. For IoT devices with\n\
    limited resources, distributed trust-based veriﬁcation makes blockchain even more\
    \ use-\nful. With a focus on ﬁxing security and data reliability issues in a distributed\
    \ controller\ncontext. Additionally, we want to increase the accuracy of our system\
    \ using machine\nlearning methods.\nIt might be signiﬁcant to add an intrusion\
    \ detection system utilizing various deep\nlearning algorithms in future work\
    \ to prevent the insertion of fake Sensor data in the\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.P., S.D. and S.R.; methodology,\

    Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • A mapping framework
    is built connecting ReSOLVE with 4 IoT capabilities and 6Rs. • IoT-enabled tracking
    and monitoring capabilities dominates Loop model. • Optimize model is related
    to ‘Reduce’ by monitoring and optimization of IoT. • IoT provides virtual and
    dematerialized solutions, supporting ‘Redesign’ strategy. • IoT reduces the energy
    use of the Optimize and Loop business model with 20–30%. Abstract In recent years,
    circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable requirement to foster
    improvements in environmental performance. However, the current literature rarely
    discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT) and CBM. This paper first
    identifies four IoT capabilities including monitoring, tracking, optimization
    and design evolution for improving CBM performance based on the ReSOLVE framework.
    In a second step, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach analyzes
    how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT
    cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks, followed by assessing the
    quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving in CBM. Finally, challenges
    are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM. The results show that the
    assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate current studies. IoT
    plays a significant role in these business models respectively through tracking,
    monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative) case studies for
    Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed. IoT holds the
    potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced applications
    in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol energy consumption,
    interoperability, security and financial investment might become main obstacles
    for the wider use of IoT in CBM. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    frameworkCircular business model 1. Introduction 1.1. Key concepts and a brief
    history of the IoT Since the birth of the internet in the early 1980s, attempts
    have been made to connect “Things” with the internet. In 1990, John Romkey created
    the first Internet ‘device’, a toaster that could be turned on and off via the
    Internet (Romkey, 2017). Paul Saffo gave the first brief description of sensors
    and how they could be used in connection with the internet in 1997 (Saffo, 1997).
    To describe this growing connection of sensors and similar devices providing real-time
    information via the internet, in 1999 the term “Internet of Things” was coined
    by Kevin Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization and invented a new
    technology called Radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based item identification
    in the same year (Suresh et al., 2014). In 2003, Walmart deployed RFID in all
    its shops across the globe to measure product stocks and sales and support supply
    chain management (Harold, 2007). In 2005, International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU, 2005) regarded the IoT as a third wave of the world''s information industry
    transformation. In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the usage
    of the “white space spectrum” (Suresh et al., 2014). Later, IT giants like Cisco,
    IBM and Ericsson took a lot of educational and commercial initiatives with IoT.
    Some countries, like China, listed the IoT as a strategic emerging technology
    in their long-term plans (MIIT, 2012). The IoT technology can be simply explained
    as a connection between humans - computers - things. It uses RFID, infrared sensors,
    global positioning systems, laser scanners and other information-sensing equipment
    to connect any item under internet protocol (IP) with a unique IP address for
    information exchange and communication, which can achieve intelligent positioning,
    tracking, monitoring and management of items. The systems architecture can, for
    instance, be based on the context of operations and processes in real-time scenarios.
    For instance, in a smart home, every electrical switch box could be connected
    with a smart phone so that it could be operated remotely. The HarmonyOS system
    recently created by Huawei uses full stack decoupling architecture that could
    even solve constraints issues on the boundary of software and hardware, thus making
    it possible for other collaborators to join the system (Chen and Matt, 2021).
    Altogether, the application boundary of the IoT has been expanded considerably.
    Such a scenario does not need a processor and a storage device installed in every
    switch box. It just needs a sensor to capture signals and process them (mostly
    switching ON/OFF). 1.2. Potentials by IoT technologies in CE in a finite world
    Avoiding overshooting of planetary boundaries for climate change (Rockström et
    al., 2009) and switching to more sustainable practices are among the greatest
    challenges of the 21st century. Any approach to reduce pressures requires simultaneous
    consideration of economic, social, and especially environmental aspects of industrial
    processes, as well as respective interactions along cradle-to-grave value chains
    of products and services (Ren et al., 2013). Important strategies to reduce critical
    raw material use are sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and circular usage
    of products and materials (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019). Seuring and Müller
    (2008) defined SSCM as “the management of material, information and capital flows
    as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain, while taking goals
    from all three dimensions – environmental, economic and social into account which
    are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements.” Circularity adds a different
    perspective to SSCM as it tries to keep substances in closed loops. Unlike a linear
    economy that is based on a “take-make-dispose” model, CE promotes longevity, reparability,
    durability and recyclability of products with the aim of a full re-use of resources
    (Elisha, 2020). It therefore symbolizes a linear to loop transition for supply
    chains in sustainability (Schröder et al., 2019). In the industry 4.0 (I4.0) era,
    the IoT offers opportunities to foster CE in value chains through real-time monitoring
    of the resources inventory (Mohammadian, 2019). It can support the minimization
    of waste flows through product lifetime detection. As consequence material reuse
    and recycling processes can be optimized. In summary, IoT promotes a highly accurate,
    efficient and sound use of resources aimed at the shift from disposable to renewable
    resources paradigm, and facilitates the born and development of CBM (Ghisellini
    et al., 2016; Nižetić et al., 2020). Therefore, progress of IoT-enabled CBM has
    attracted academic researches, which have recently assessed the impact of I4.0
    technologies such as IoT on CBM with different conclusions (Rosa et al., 2019,
    2020). They discussed CBM and IoT from economic, social and environmental perspectives
    (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018; Ding et al., 2023). Rejeb et al. (2022) reviewed
    how the IoT provides contributions and challenges in the CBM domain. They identified
    important drivers and provided a structured framework that exploring business
    and management-focused CE strategies based on IoT technologies. However, there
    is still a large gap between theory and practice (Gorissen et al., 2016). In particular,
    most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are encountering unprecedented pressure
    to improve environmental performance. Since the adoption cost of the IoT could
    be tremendous, they might hesitate to seize IoT-enabled emission reduction opportunities
    based on their specific status (Ding et al., 2023; Awan et al., 2022a). This requires
    an in-depth understanding of the IoT capabilities and the characteristics of different
    CBMs to find their best intersection point. Besides, the circularity of IoT devices
    themselves should also be considered (Beier et al., 2018). Given these research
    gaps this paper addresses the following research questions. i) What are the (synergy)
    contributions of IoT capabilities under different CBM? ii) What are the carbon
    emission reduction potentials of the IoT in different CBM? iii) What are the obstacles
    for SMEs to adopt IoT in promoting circular strategies? The contributions of this
    paper are as follows: We used a pre-defined circular business framework (ReSOLVE)
    developed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2015) to analyze the CBM-IoT context
    and linked it to 6 R principles to specifically map the IoT capabilities into
    each business practices. This visualizes how IoT contributes differently in each
    business model and provides information for us to describe the relationship between
    IoT capabilities, 6 R and CBM. Additionally, we quantitatively review the literature
    on how IoT can contribute to reducing environmental impacts under CBM and identify
    their obstacles. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the Prisma
    methodology we used as the method for the literature review, and the reasoning
    of paper selection. Section 3 reviews IoT''s role in CE, introduces the capabilities
    of IoT correlated with CBM and identifies its environmental opportunities. Section
    4 reflects on potential obstacles for IoT adjustment in CBM. Section 5 comprehensively
    summarizes our findings and concludes. Finally, section 6 outlines limitations
    and gives recommendations for future research. 2. Review approach: Prisma 2.1.
    Introduction of Prisma In June 2022, we conducted a literature search based on
    the checklist framework provided by the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015).
    PRISMA was initially used in the medical field. Although other methods for conducting
    literature reviews and meta-analyses are available (Horvathova, 2012; Luederitz
    et al., 2016), PRISMA guidelines have become widely accepted as an approach to
    conduct transparent literature reviews. Recently they have been applied in the
    field of sustainability and CE research (Blanco et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019;
    Zalk and Behrens, 2018; Aguilar-Hernandez et al., 2021). The latest PRISMA Abstract
    2020 (Page et al., 2021a, Page et al., 2021b) suggests discussing 5 main items
    in relation to 10 subcategories in a review. We refer to the checklist items listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Major steps in Prisma Abstract 2020 (Page et al., 2021a,
    Page et al., 2021b). Section and Topic Item # Checklist item TITLE Title 1 Identify
    the report as a systematic review. BACKGROUND Objectives 2 Provide an explicit
    statement of the main objectives or questions. METHODS Eligibility criteria 3
    Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review. Information sources
    4 Specify the information sources (e.g., databases, search terms) used to identify
    studies. Risk of bias 5 Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the
    studies included. Synthesis of results 6 Specify the methods used to present and
    synthesize results. RESULTS Included studies 7 Give the total number of studies
    included and participants and summarize relevant characteristics of the studies.
    Synthesis of results 8 Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating
    the number of studies included and participants for each. If a meta-analysis was
    carried out, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval. If
    comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (i.e., which group is favoured).
    DISCUSSION Limitations of evidence 9 Provide a brief summary of the limitations
    of the evidence included in the review (e.g., study risk of bias, inconsistency
    and imprecision). Interpretation 10 Provide a general interpretation of the results
    and important implications. These categories explain the search objectives and
    eligibility criteria, including the methods and reasons for including and excluding
    certain records (i.e. some papers do not contain the keywords checked for but
    have keywords with similar meanings, some papers contain the keywords but do not
    explain them in detail). Second, it describes the steps of the quantitative analysis,
    which includes collecting data from selected publications and harmonizing their
    values. Based on this framework, this literature review was conducted. 2.2. Classification
    of papers We use the 6 R concept (Joshi et al., 2006) to initially classify circularity
    strategies and related business models, as shown in Fig. 1. The 6 R concept discerns
    Reuse, Recycle, Reduce, Repair, Remanufacture and Redesign. Sihvonen and Ritola
    (2015) regarded the 6 R framework as the operational approaches and core principles
    of CE. Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF, 2013) pointed out that discovering
    new paths to support CE under 6 R guidance – “an industrial system that is restorative
    or regenerative by intention and design” is becoming more and more vital against
    the background of Industrial 4.0 era. From a systems perspective, the combination
    of six operational approaches (6 R) enables new business models of CE at the macro
    level (Kirchherr et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download

    Based on these characteristics, the ReSOLVE framework further explains CE -- Preserve
    and enhance natural capital, optimize resource yields and foster system effectiveness,
    and classifies circular models based on the economic and resource impacts of major
    sectors (EMF, 2015). It offers a tool for generating circular strategies and growth
    initiatives. Jabbour et al. (2018) then connected Industry 4.0 technologies to
    six CBM proposed by the ReSOLVE framework, namely Regenerating, Share, Optimize,
    Loop, Virtualize and Exchange, to guide organizations through implementing the
    principles of the CE (EMF, 2015), as shown in Table 2. Most technologies own opportunities
    in specific areas, while the IoT can play a significant role to make such business
    models viable (Jabbour et al., 2018). Table 2. Explanation of six business models
    in ReSOLVE framework. Business models Explanation Regenerate This business model
    is based on a shift to renewable energy and materials. Biological cycles are used
    to enable the circulation of energy and materials, and to convert organic waste
    into sources of energy and raw material for other chains. Share Assets are shared
    between individuals (peer-to-peer sharing of privately owned products or public
    sharing of a pool of products). As a consequence, products should be designed
    to last longer by the producers, and maintenance should be available to allow
    the re-use and extension of product life. Optimize This business model requires
    organizations to use digital manufacturing technologies, such as IoT, automation,
    and big data to reduce waste in production systems across supply chains. As a
    result, organizations will benefit from increased performance. Loop This business
    model aims to promote the circularity of raw materials and energy. The design,
    production, and supply chain therefore have to be adjusted from the perspective
    of the entire life cycle. Virtualize This business model is service-focused which
    replaces physical with virtual and dematerialized products. Exchange It involves
    substituting old and non-renewable goods for advanced and renewable ones. While
    the exact terminology to describe IoT-related capabilities varies under different
    scenarios, we synthesized core capabilities of the technology as found in literature.
    Ingemarsdotter et al. (2019) suggests that IoT''s can support the development
    of circular business models via capabilities such as tracking, monitoring, control,
    optimization and design evolution, and stated that optimization often relies on
    the use of control capability. Therefore, we incorporated the control capability
    into optimization to reduce the list of relevant IoT capabilities to four, as
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. IoT capabilities that can support implementation of
    the ReSOLVE framework. IoT capabilities Definition of functions Tracking Available
    information for products'' identity, location, or unique composition. Monitoring
    Available information for products'' real-time condition, or environment. This
    includes alerts and notifications. Optimization Goal-based improvements of operations
    are controlled and optimized by using advanced algorithms. Design Evolution The
    design of a product can be upgraded based on data feedback from other lifecycle
    phases. This includes functional or routing upgrades. 2.2.1. Selection of papers
    On the basis of the discussion above, in order to systematically review the contribution
    of the IoT to circular economy business models, we used the following terms as
    a basis for the literature search in a Boolean operation -- Title, Abstract, Keyword
    = [“internet of things” AND (“circular economy” OR “circular business model” OR
    “sustainable supply chain”)]. In total, there were 432 papers available on Scopus
    and 142 papers available on Web of Science (WoS). We excluded duplicate records
    and papers that have no relation to any elements of the 6 R through browsing abstracts.
    Then, we further excluded papers with non-CBM descriptions discerned in the RESOLVE
    framework after browsing the full texts. In this way, 59 papers were retained
    to explore the contribution of the IoT to CBM, see Fig. 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (615KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart of
    selected publications in the review (status in June 2022). Then, a quantitative
    analysis of how the IoT reduces environmental impacts in CBM was conducted. For
    this, from the included papers we acquired 23 results that a) quantified impacts
    on energy-related indicators in circular economy (e.g., energy use or CO2 emissions)
    and b) compared these impacts before and after using IoT technology. 3. Review:
    impacts of the IoT on CBM 3.1. Descriptive results The retrieved 59 papers used
    for describing the contribution of the IoT to CBM can be categorized by journal,
    year of publication, and sector/application. Fig. 3 shows the number of articles
    published in different journals under the given search term and constraints. The
    number of papers published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability
    and Computers in Industry appears to dominate. These journals make up 25.5% of
    the total share, which is much higher than that of other journals. The core fields
    covered by these journals include computer science, engineering and environmental
    science. The number of papers has increased significantly over time. Publications
    in the last 3 years occupy exceed 2/3 of the total share, which indicates a growing
    interest on this topic. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    Next, we use the framework developed by Maroli et al. (2021) to classify 59 papers
    into 4 major categories: reviews, theory studies, new designs and case studies.
    Reviews include pure review articles that classify and summarize previous studies.
    Theory studies generally analyze and discuss the proposed new framework for specific
    issues mainly based on surveying experts (Delphi) or questionnaires. New designs
    imply the development of a new mathematical model or a new protocol design for
    an IoT solution but without a real case to verify factual feasibility. Case studies
    further calculate or simulate the case and obtain reference results based on real
    or defined cases compared with the new design. A brief supplementary description
    of each article is also attached to this table to provide an overview of each
    research division. These classified papers are then categorized into six business
    models suggested by ReSOLVE framework (EMF, 2015). As shown in Fig. 4. Download

    Division of publications into the 6 ReSOLVE categories of CE business models.
    Over 60% of the papers describe the contribution of IoT to Loop and Optimize models.
    Both of these two models have higher potential impacts on manufacturing, transportation
    and storage, and IoT could thus promote significant business transformation within
    these sectors (EMF, 2015). As for Optimize, IoT helps to realize smart manufacturing
    and SSCM through improving decision-making plans to reduce the consumption of
    energy and resources. Most of the theoretical studies here explored and developed
    frameworks for low carbon footprints in different industries based on IoT capabilities
    of collecting, processing information more efficiently (Gružauskas et al., 2018;
    Chit et al., 2021; Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Jagtap et al., 2021). The limited
    number of cases and new designs are usually process optimizations in enterprises,
    where IoT is used to develop intelligent production scheduling and logistics delivery
    models to promote green and sustainable development of intelligent manufacturing
    (Liao and Wang, 2019). In the Loop business model, most studies focused on waste
    management. Here, IoT is mainly used to realize waste collection optimization
    and more accuracy of decision support system for end-life products recycling (Bányai
    et al., 2019; Velvizhi et al., 2020; Al-Masri et al., 2018). Some theoretical
    studies designed CE–IoT-enabled ecosystems based on key enabling IoT technologies
    (Miaoudakis et al., 2020). Others combined it with LCA model to aid their processes
    of designing new products with low environmental impact (Zhang et al., 2020; de
    Oliveira and Soares, 2017). New designs and case studies validated IoT-enabled
    solutions based on products with different technical route characteristics, such
    as plastic waste and scrapped cars (Plakas et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018), etc.
    Though the proportion of case studies is relatively low, only 11%. The remaining
    four business models account for only a small part of the articles. Among them,
    the sharing model generally relies on online platforms or apps supported by IoT,
    which brings the channel for products or information sharing between different
    stakeholders (Mastos et al., 2020). Virtualize and Exchange models usually demands
    extra technologies such as virtual world tools, digital twin (DT) and 3D printers
    to realize (Gustafson-Pearce and Grant, 2017; Despeisse et al., 2017; Rocca et
    al., 2020). 3.2. Connection of ReSOLVE framework with 6 R and IoT capabilities
    We further classified the papers in a number of matrices, considering the 6 R,
    IoT capabilities and Circular Business Model (CBM) categories discussed in section
    2. This results in a ‘heat map’ of the occurrences of CBM-IoT and CBM-6R cross-sections
    within the sample of 59 papers, see Fig. 5. Many papers describe multiple CBM-IoT
    and CBM-6R cross-sections. It should further be noted that while the categories
    are uniquely defined, they are not mutually exclusive. Below, we explored patterns
    for each of the CBM. 1. Loop business model Download : Download high-res image
    (399KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Heat map of the CBM-6R and
    CBM-IoT cross-section occurrences. The findings show that IoT-enabled ‘Recycle’
    dominates, followed by ‘Remanufacture’ and ‘Repair’. Papers displaying Loop usually
    rely on tracking or monitoring capabilities, while optimization and design evolution
    are relatively unexplored. In terms of recycling, remanufacturing, and repairing,
    the adoption of novel Internet-based transactions can exploit information for
    faster and more sustainable collection of post-consumption products, they can
    be tracked using sensors, RFID tags, and barcodes (Al-Masri et al., 2018). As
    a consequence, organizations are able to remanufacture, or recycle components
    of products and packaging (Vanderroost et al., 2017; Gligoric et al., 2019). In
    line with the Redesign prospect, product designers need to incorporate environmental
    criteria into their design decisions. They can obtain data from an IoT-based product
    life cycle management system to aid their processes of sustainable design and
    development (Zhang et al., 2020; Chit et al., 2021; de Oliveira and Soares, 2017).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 4. 2. Optimize business model Table 4. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Loop model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking A research project called POIROT, which exploits IoT technologies,
    aiming to realize a platform for the traceability of organic waste and transform
    it into inert, odorless and sanitized material (De Fazio et al., 2019). Monitoring
    An IoT-enabled decision support system for a CE model that addresses the uncertainty
    of a product''s residual value based on the life cycle monitored from the IoT
    sensors (Mboli et al., 2020). Optimization A system that combines intelligent
    transportation systems (RFIDs, sensors, cameras, actuators and surveillance systems)
    and an advanced decision system (incorporating data sharing between truck drivers
    in real time to perform dynamic route optimization) for efficient waste collection
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). Most of the papers exploring Optimize models are highly
    related to IoT-enabled ‘Reduce’, which is mainly realized by monitoring and optimization
    capabilities, as shown in Appendix figure A1. Through data monitoring from processes
    and agents such as machines, the IoT increases the possibility of identifying
    potential failures, and predictive maintenance can reduce the waste of non-performing
    products (Venkatesh et al., 2020; Laskurain-Iturbe et al., 2021). Additionally,
    based on the demands of the production and consumption of resources, managers
    could monitor and Optimize production rates and the use of sensors as well as
    algorithms would enable them to automatically intervene in processes to reduce
    intermediate inventory (Ghoreishi and Happonen, 2022; Roy and Roy 2019; Awan et
    al., 2022b). The IoT with the combination of cloud computing and machine learning
    provides potential for complex and integrated data-driven process manufacturing
    models in terms of robustness and accuracy (Fisher et al., 2020). Typical cases
    are listed in Table 5. 3. Share business model Table 5. Illustration of the use
    of IoT capabilities in the Optimize model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Tracking RFID technology to tag and track fresh milk could reduce the amount of
    product shrinkage (Bottani et al., 2014). Monitoring Based on IoT sensors, energy
    and cost savings will be achieved as long as the state of the ideal ball mill
    is specifically analyzed and extended to the other ball mills. (Ma et al., 2020).
    Optimization Each node (including suppliers, wholesalers and retailers) could
    be involved in managing and optimizing its own performance in terms of production,
    deliveries and environmental compliance by using RFID tags and wireless sensor
    networks (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; Hasanova and Romanovs, 2020). Monitoring and
    tracking are main capabilities of IoT that contribute to sharing business model,
    they help in the product ‘Resign’ and ‘Recycle’ in order to achieve product lifetime
    extension, as shown in Appendix figure A2. Information on consumers'' behavior
    is collected through websites and apps, organizations can therefore both improve
    product design and provide a digital service for better utilization or replacement
    of equipment, and increase customer satisfaction (Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Ingemarsdotter
    et al., 2020). Moreover, the use of sensors in products allows performance monitoring
    - for instance, monitoring maintenance requirements - thereby allowing organizations
    to proactively provide a high quality of service to customers. As a consequence
    of monitoring products during consumer use, organizations can invest in extending
    product life spans by applying the 3Rs strategy (repair, reuse, and recycle).
    Typical cases are listed in Table 6. 4. Virtualize business model Table 6. Illustration
    of the use of IoT capabilities in the Share model. IoT capabilities Representative
    examples Tracking Cranfield University launched a shoe recycling project: it includes
    the design of an intelligent component (IoT) that tracks the condition of the
    shoes and identifies the need for replacement/upgrading. The modular design of
    the shoes allows them to be easily disassembled for refurbishing or recycling
    (Nobre and Tavares, 2017). Monitoring A cross-company IoT communication protocol
    has the potential to offer an automated negotiation ecosystem between scrap metal
    producers and waste collecting companies based on cost, demand etc. (Mastos et
    al., 2020). Optimization IoT helps to achieve a mutual visible inventory under
    business-to-business e-commerce models in real time, where average food inventory,
    amount of food waste, frequency of lateral inventory share and ordering from the
    main depot; customer service level in the network is optimized (Ekren et al.,
    2021). Since service is a core focus of Virtualize, using real-time data to monitor
    supply activities is important to enhance the customer experience. It also triggers
    the potential of IoT-enabled “Redesign” of the product or service with the help
    of design evolution capability. Through virtually designing, simulating, and optimizing
    the system and converting it on the real world, it is possible to achieve system
    reconfigurability through a change of both specific hardware (i.e., change of
    robot tools for disassembly activities), and software resources (i.e., robot program
    coding) (Sassanelli et al., 2021). The IoT enables connections between organizations,
    suppliers, and customers in order to offer services rather than physical products
    (Jabbour et al., 2018). In addition, the IoT is able to collect information on
    consumers’ behavior and features of past designs, which designers can use to improve
    service quality. Typical cases are listed in Table 7. 5. Exchange business model
    Table 7. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Virtualize model.
    IoT capabilities Representative examples Monitoring Gustafson-Pearce and Grant
    (2017) tested 3D Virtual World tools with multiple sources of ‘streamed’ data
    generated by IoT, to discover whether knowledge sharing and learning within a
    horizontal supply chain was effective and reduced greenhouse gas emissions related
    to business travel. Design evolution A platform that combines hybrid IoT and blockchain
    to provide interactive innovation in prefabricated housing construction among
    shareholders, who were involved in life-cycle value co-design via online channels
    (e.g., mobile apps) (Li et al., 2021). A platform installing IoT devices in a
    smart building to measure energy consumption and provide energy optimization consulting
    services for end-users and building managers (Sharma et al., 2021). IoT could
    provide a scenario of experience shopping from a mirror image, aiming to solve
    the distortion of consumer''s experience in traditional online shopping (Gao and
    Han, 2021). IoT integrates the manufacturing execution system (MES) to the DT
    by using a communication protocol, which is able to give commands to the MES from
    external sources and digitalize the CE practices (Rocca et al., 2020). This model
    could acquire strength by adopting additive manufacturing and IoT systems with
    monitoring capability (Despeisse et al., 2017). 3D printers are able to process
    renewable and sustainable production. Based on interaction between organizations
    and customers, some companies are able to manufacture customized products by using
    databases incorporating 3D printers, where IoT helps to save time and material
    use in additive manufacturing. These kinds of functions make IoT easier to achieve
    CE principles. Typical cases are listed in Table 8. 6. Regenerate business model
    Table 8. Illustration of the use of IoT capabilities in the Exchange model. IoT
    capabilities Representative examples Monitoring The additive manufacturing leads
    to reduced use of material, IoT-enabled 3D printers enable the recycling of small
    quantities of waste (Despeisse et al., 2017). Optimization IoTs are used for the
    identification of engineered disassemblers as well as the real-time status of
    reproducible resources to build efficient multi-target production planning in
    real-time by the seed swarm optimization algorithm (Chau et al., 2021). The model
    could benefit from IoT in the form of sensors and networks. The design, production
    and supply decisions of CE could be adjusted based on data provided by IoT (EMF,
    2016). This would make it possible to reduce unnecessary resource consumption
    to improve the productivity of harvests, and to extend the life cycle of the land
    use. Typical cases are listed in Table 9. Table 9. Illustration of the use of
    IoT capabilities in the Regenerate model. IoT capabilities Representative examples
    Monitoring To monitor, and control factors related to land management between
    crop rotation, to automate irrigation systems based on weather conditions in real
    time, and to manage the use of pesticides according to the health of plantations
    (EMF Report of Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Optimization IoT allows real-time
    measurement of ceramic tile production, providing the capability to modify the
    composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize the use of
    local raw materials, reducing the distances between mines and the factory and
    by favoring rail transport (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). In all, the concept of
    6 R is gradually supported by IoT technology. It promotes the combination of 6
    R in different circular business practices (Kirchherr et al., 2017; Spaltini et
    al., 2021), and each business model represents a major circularity opportunity
    enabled by the IoT technology that is quite different from growth in the linear
    economy. Therefore, we selected main contributors of 6 R and CBM from the ‘heat
    map’ results, and then constructed a relationship framework that containing the
    conceptualization of 4 IoT capabilities, 6 R and ReSOLVE framework, as shown in
    Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (341KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Relationship framework for IoT enabled 6 R and CBM. As for IoT capabilities,
    the monitoring plays a significant role, which promotes most circular business
    models by jointly facilitating all 6Rs, followed by the optimization capability.
    And for the intermediate nodes of 6 R actions, Recycle and Redesign are the core
    CE principles linking upstream IoT capabilities and downstream circular strategies.
    In different ways, these actions all increase the utilization of physical assets,
    prolong their life, and shift resource use from finite to renewable sources. They
    potentially reinforce and accelerate the performance of the other actions, creating
    a compounding effect. 3.3. Quantitative analysis of how the use of IoT in CBMs
    reduces energy-related environmental impacts Within the collected papers, 20 papers
    provide quantitative data on how the use of IoT in CBMs can reduce environmental
    impacts. These papers provide 23 cases. We included them in our quantitative analysis
    for they mainly use energy savings as the primary measurement. Fig. 7 depicts
    how much energy is saved by using IoT in the six ReSOLVE business model categories
    (Virtualize is missing due to lack of data). The X-axis shows the ReSOLVE business
    model categories and their number of samples in each. The Y-axis represents the
    relative energy savings compared to a baseline scenario without IoT enhancement
    (i.e., the energy use in the baseline is set on 100%). Supplementary Table 2 contains
    a list of cases and their references. 1. Optimize business model Download : Download

    saving under different IoT-enabled CBM (CI = 95%). Most results show quantitative
    data from the Optimize business model (11 results). Here, big data of related
    resource objects is collected using IoT sensors. The resource allocation framework
    is then optimized using heuristic algorithms for specific consumption habits to
    prevent any unwanted negative environmental impact in scheduling issues (Liao
    and Wang, 2019). 2. Loop business model 6 results consider the Loop business model.
    IoT solutions enable the transition to a cyber-physical1 waste management system,
    and provide real-time information on waste generation, treatment, transportation,
    and material handling capacity in big random systems. Carbon emissions from collected
    and transported waste have been significantly reduced due to enhanced recycling
    (Velvizhi et al., 2020). 3. Share business model 4 results discuss the Share business
    model, where IoT lowers energy and resource waste in corporate processes by sharing
    information, products or services (Ekren et al., 2021). For instance, IoT facilitates
    the recording of food expiration dates and facilitates communal food sharing (Phiri
    and Trevorrow, 2019). 4. Regenerate and Exchange business model The Regenerate
    and Exchange models each have a single case. In Regenerate model, IoT is utilized
    for the identification of engineered disassemblers and the real-time status of
    regenerable resources in order to construct effective multi-target production
    planning (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2019). While in Exchange model, IoT assists in
    modifying the composition of the ceramic bodies and the transport mix to maximize
    the utilization of local raw materials (Chau et al., 2021). The effects of relative
    energy savings in the Optimize and Loop business models are evident and comparable,
    with corresponding mean value of 30% and 25%. It may be attributed to the parallels
    of the two models in leveraging IoT capabilities. With the difference that Optimize
    model utilizes more on the optimization capabilities, which may provide it with
    higher energy saving potential. Some measures in the Optimize model could even
    achieve energy savings of up to 70%. But the effect of the Share business model
    is highly variable, ranging from less than 20%–80%, with the majority of results
    falling closer to the lower end. The results of the remaining three models are
    limited. Nevertheless, they present oppotunities for further investigation. 4.
    Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the use of IoT in CBMs While reviewing
    the literature, as described above we found many ways of how IoT could support
    the implementation of circular CBMs. However, some of these references also highlighted
    environmental risks of IoT, or other obstacles to implementing and using IoT.
    These findings including related references are discussed below, and Table 10
    summarizes them. Table 10. Environmental drawbacks and other obstacles to the
    implementation of IoT. Type Drawbacks and obstacles Environmental Use of harmful
    substances and non-degradable resources Hardware power consumption IoT node software
    energy consumption IoT protocol energy efficiency Other Lack of standardization
    and technological knowledge among partners Data availability High financial investment
    Security of virtual platform Inadequate internet connectivity 4.1. Environmental
    drawbacks One of the drawbacks of IoT-enabled business models includes the energy
    use of IoT and related carbon emissions, such as IoT hardware, node software and
    protocol energy consumption (Fraga-Lamas et al., 2021). Hardware is the basis
    for the IoT network, and both hardware and software needs to be optimized together
    to re duce environmental burdens. Such optimizations are particularly important
    for certain digital signal processing tasks, including compression, feature extraction,
    or machine learning training. The IoT is also dependent on protocols that enable
    communicating between the various nodes and routing devices involved in an IoT
    network. In terms of software implementation, these protocols must be energy-efficient
    and should minimize the use of communication interfaces. Next to this, IoT equipment
    may result in difficult to process electronic waste. An example consists of RFID
    tags that are hazardous to the environment and are difficult to recycle (Yu et
    al., 2022). Another concern is that IoT enables mass customization. Customization
    makes it more difficult for another user to reuse or recycle an item (Birkel et
    al., 2019). A key observation is that many studies do not take into account such
    environmental drawbacks of implementing IoT technology (i.e., the impact of producing
    or using IoT devices, etc.). Some preliminary analyses have been presented in
    the literature. For instance, Mataloto et al. (2019) discovered that IoT devices
    (LoRa) for energy management systems require an annual energy usage of 5.2 kWh
    if applied in small buildings (16–40 m2). Bottani et al. (2014) assessed the environmental
    performance and burdens of the use of RFID tags in a fresh milk supply chain based
    on life cycle assessment (LCA) and found that the environmental costs of 1 million
    RFID tags are 32,900 kg CO2-eq in climate change potential, 23.9 kg P-eq in freshwater
    eutrophication, and 156 molc H + -eq in acidification potential. Comparatively
    to the existing studies, there is a dearth of papers that examine the positive
    and negative contributions of IoT to CBM via case studies or simulations. This
    involves not only a full examination of its production, transportation, disposal,
    and reuse synergies, but also an evaluation of the LCA of IoT components. 4.2.
    Other obstacles Next to environmental drawbacks the literature we reviewed gave
    some more general implementation obstacles with regard to the use of IoT in CBMs.
    Firstly, there is often a lack of structured data management processes to ensure
    the acquisition of high-quality data for industrial analysis (Ingemarsdotter et
    al., 2020). Due to the limited availability and variety of industrial data, evaluating
    and validating representative models of real-world systems can be difficult, i.e.,
    determining when sufficient data has been acquired to ensure the representativeness
    of a simulation framework. (Fisher et al., 2020). Secondly, the absence of standardization
    and guidance in implementing IoT across various businesses poses a concern. There
    can be a lack of regulations addressing data ownership among stakeholders (Astill
    et al., 2019). The wide implementation of CE strategies is contingent upon solving
    such data ownership issues. Thirdly, ensuring privacy and data security poses
    a challenge (Roy and Roy, 2019). End-users as intermediate nodes in the manufacturing
    and remanufacturing cycle and vulnerable firewall nodes can be susceptible to
    botnet assaults (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). One typical case is the IoT botnet
    Mirai, a malware that could target consumer electronics and home routers, turning
    them into a zombie remotely controlled bots that can be used in large-scale network
    attacks (Antonakakis et al., 2017). Such challenges may be solved by IoT projects
    funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research program, it includes the
    European Cloud Initiative, the GAIA-X initiative, as well as public-private partnerships
    such as the Smart Networks and Services JU and the AI, Big Data and Robotics (Calisti,
    2020). These projects are expected to use distributed AI, address security, privacy
    and trust requirements by design and allow for new de-centralized topologies and
    governance. In addition, it is challenging to rapidly design IoT-enabled products
    for interoperability, adaptability, and upgradability (Ingemarsdotter et al.,
    2020). Currently, potential solutions tend to point at blockchain technology.
    However, integrating blockchain within the IoT framework will also pose technical,
    infrastructure, energy consumption, interoperability and social regulatory issues
    (Feng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2020). The last impediment
    are the limited resources small-scale enterprises can invest systematically in
    IoT technologies throughout their entire supply chains (Tan et al., 2020). 5.
    Conclusion and outlook This review has assessed the state-of-the-art relation
    of IoT and CBM from several perspectives. Based on the Prisma approach, this article
    reviews the literature on the IoT and CBMs that has been expanding significantly
    in recent years. Through the classification of their methods and contents, this
    paper constructed a mapping framework connecting the ReSOLVE concept with four
    IoT capabilities and the 6 R framework. It depicts the current research status
    of IoT supported CBMs and explains their contribution for enterprises from the
    perspective of 6 R with representative cases. IoT by its support of joint interoperability
    for system optimization, timely monitoring and tracking, has contributed to the
    enhancement of industrial efficiency, recycling, and the reduction of unnecessary
    material and energy use. These characteristics of IoT support the implementation
    and success of CBMs, particularly the Loop and Optimize CBMs. These conclusions
    are similar to those of previously published studies. However, the dynamic feedback
    potential of the IoT also proves to be vital for the “Redesign” of product or
    service concepts, especially for Virtualize, Share and Exchange models which have
    not been fully explored before. Therefore, we revealed potential directions based
    on these preliminary studies: For instance, in the Share approach, IoT helps to
    provide a sharing platform that enables consumers to share products, essentially
    providing the same amount of final services with a smaller product pool. The IoT
    also provides virtual and dematerialized options as service solutions rather than
    physical products with similar functions to achieve design evolution capability,
    supporting the “Redesign” CE strategy through the combination of other I4.0 technologies
    such as DT. The review of quantitative assessments suggests that IoT has the potential
    to reduce the energy consumption of the Optimize and Loop business model by about
    20–30%. By redesigning and integrating IoT and IoT-based algorithms into business
    operations, the energy efficiency of the system can be greatly increased. In addition,
    IoT can help to minimize waste generation and enhance efficiency of resource use.
    However, the widespread usage of IoT and related data processing activities in
    itself can lead to higher energy use and generation of e-waste, which often is
    difficult to recycle. IoT also poses a number of obstacles for its cross-business
    applications, including the difficulties of establishing universal standards for
    data processing, cybersecurity liability issues, and relatively high investment
    costs. These assessments of strengths and challenges of IoT can provide more intuitive
    information for SMEs investors who are interested in innovative technologies and
    circular development. 6. Limitations and recommendations This research has limitations
    as well. Firstly, given the fact that the research on the interaction between
    the IoT and CE is still in its infancy, most of the references discuss conceptual
    frameworks, models and theoretical evaluations, and just a few case studies. Most
    case studies only explore one or a few technical applications of IoT, these limits
    the value of meta-analyses as attempted in this paper. Particularly for the Virtualize,
    Exchange and Regenerate CBMs the number of available cases was low. We hence recommend
    a more systematic, quantitative analysis of case studies on how IoT can contribute
    to CBMs and environmental improvements. Secondly, the literature gives just limited
    information on the environmental drawbacks of IoT. Some studies on e.g., RFID
    suggest that their production and use generate just limited environmental damage
    (Jia et al., 2012). However, to analyze the environmental benefits and drawbacks
    of IoT comprehensively, further research is needed that should consider specific
    IoT application scenarios, material choices and future improvement potentials
    that may be available due to scale and learning effects. These could become the
    focal points of the future phase of IoT research. Declaration of competing interest

    \ or COVID-\n19 worldwide are turning to wastewater-based epidemiology as great\
    \ potential tools for assessing and management of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Surveillance\
    \ and tracking of the pathogens in the wastewater are key to the early warning\

    \ assays is been developed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA \nspecimen clinical testing and\
    \ detection in the water system. Convectional wastewater treatment methods and\
    \ disinfection are \nexpected to eradicate the SAR-CoV-2. Chlorine, UV radiation,\
    \ ozone, chloramine is been used to inactivate and disinfect the \nwater treatment\
    \ system against the SARS-CoV-2. Water management and design of the water infrastructure\
    \ require major \nchanges to accommodate climate change, water cycle, reimaging\

    \ 2 (SARS-\nCoV-2) that caused the global pandemic of the coronavirus \n(COVID-19)\
    \ emerged from Wuhan, China and spread glob-\nally. The outbreak was declared\
    \ a public health emergence \non 30th January 2020 by World Health Organization\
    \ and \non 11th February 2020 given a name of new coronavirus \n(COVID-19) (La\
    \ Rosa et al. 2020). It is transmitted through \nrespiratory droplets (inhalation\
    \ of the droplets) expelled \nfrom the mouth and noses of the infected person\
    \ during \nspeaking, coughing, sneezing and contaminated surfaces. \nThere are\
    \ a high number of COVID-19 cases per capita in \nthe world that goes undetected\

    \ own is not \na solution to curbing the spread of SARS-COV-2 but part of \nthe\
    \ strategy when combine with immediate isolation, rapid \ndiagnosis and tracking\
    \ technology (contact tracking). The \ncost of contact tracking, testing and isolation\
    \ are high in the \nshort-term and long-term. This leads to disruption of the\
    \ \neconomic and social cost due to social distances that affect \nthe communities,\
    \ businesses and individuals. The measures \nare lethal or severe until the time\
    \ the crisis is managed or \nthrough the intervention of the pharmaceutical (treatment\
    \ or \nvaccination of the COVID-19) availability. Maintenance of \nthe open economy\
    \ and society while minimizing the popu-\nlation health crisis is important (Salathé\

    \ viral fragments have been found \nin excrete, this call for wastewater monitoring\
    \ and analy-\nsis (wastewater surveillance) of the potential health risk \n(W.H.O\
    \ 2020). Figure 1 outlines and highlights the poten-\ntial of the wastewater surveillance\
    \ in the monitoring of the \nCOVID-19 in water, wastewater system and public health\
    \ \n(Farkas 2020).\nThe present study combined consideration on monitoring \n\
    and mitigation, surveillance and tracking, economy, practi-\ncality, data capture\
    \ and analysis in the water and wastewater \nsurveillance when performing the\
    \ population-wide screening \nfor the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.\nVulnerability to COVID‑19\n\
    The major concern underlying the potential burden to \nthe COVID-19 in the low-\
    \ and middle-income coun-\ntries (LMICs) are vulnerability due to epidemiological\
    \ \n(i.e. fatality rates due to the age, gender and underlying \nhealth conditions),\
    \ transmission (i.e. hygiene infrastruc-\nture, population and housing density,\
    \ urban mobility and \nimmigration, unventilated and house confinement, high \n\
    prices of the sanitisers and masks, shared toilets during \na call of nature and\
    \ lack of access to water, inadequate \nwaste disposal leading to biohazards risks\
    \ and social inte-\ngration/distancing), high demand for the health system \n\
    and availability of the intensive care, control measures of \nthe social protection\
    \ and economic package (Wilkinson \n2020).\nWater, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)\
    \ \nCOVID‑19 monitoring and mitigation\nWastewater is a scarce resource that should\
    \ be protected and \nreuse. The water in the sewer system acts as early warming\
    \ \nto the outbreak of a disease in the urban population. COVID-\n19 pandemic\
    \ has highlighted the importance of proper \nmanagement of water, sanitation and\
    \ hygiene (WASH) and \nprotection of human health (W.H.O 2020). Contaminated \n\
    wastewater with pathogens and exposure to human beings \nand animals play a major\
    \ role in the spread of the diseases. \nSurveillance and tracking of the pathogens\
    \ in the wastewa-\nter is key to the early warning system (EWS) and public \n\
    health strategy monitoring of the COVID-19 (Street et al. \n2020). SARS-CoV-2\
    \ genetics matters can be detected in \nthe gastro-intestinal waste of a COVID-19\
    \ patient and are \ntransmitted through the faecal-oral route. The virus genetic\
    \ \nhave been detected in the wastewater treatment system and \nraising concern\
    \ about the potential of the transmission \nroute. The survival rate of the COVID-19\
    \ from the infective \nstate in faecal matter is yet to be determined. According\
    \ to \n(Pan et al. 2020), digestive systems were conformed from \nthe patients\
    \ of the COVID-19. Other symptoms included \nare respiratory, lack of appetite,\
    \ diarrhoea, abdominal pain \nand vomiting. Convectional wastewater treatment\
    \ methods \nand disinfection are expected to eradicate the SAR-CoV-2 \nbut their\
    \ high population and under-maintained wastewater \ntreatment plants can contaminate\
    \ the surroundings where the \nSAR-CoV-2 survive up to several days on untreated\
    \ water \nand much longer in a lower temperature region. The pre-\nvention of\
    \ water pollution from the collection, distribution, \nconsumption is outlined\
    \ by the World Health Organization \nFig. 1  Potential of the wastewater surveillance\
    \ in monitoring for the COVID-19 in water, wastewater system and public health\
    \ (Farkas et al. \n2020)\n1097\nInternational Journal of Environmental Science\
    \ and Technology (2023) 20:1095–1112 \n1 3\n(WHO) for the resistance of the COVID-19\
    \ (W.H.O 2019). \nFigure 2 shows the COVID-19 possibility of contamina-\ntion\
    \ in the rural and urban water cycle with the potential \nof human exposure to\
    \ the SARS-CoV-2 (Bhowmick et al. \n2020).\nThe pathways indicates; (1) spread\
    \ of the COVID-19 from \nanimal to human being, (2) COVID-19 enters the wastewater\
    \ \nsystems using sewage system, (3) quarantine and hospitals \ncentres, (4) contaminated\
    \ wastewater flow to the wastewater \ntreatment plant, (5) Mishandling and careless\
    \ disposal of the \nbiomedical waste contaminates the water system, (6) Waste-\n\
    water generated in the public premises, (7) Discharge of the \ntreated wastewater\
    \ back to the receiving water, (8) Bypassing \nof the contaminated untreated wastewater\
    \ into the water body, \n(9) Direct consumption of the contaminated water distribution\
    \ \nnetwork by rural communities, (10) Disinfected and treated \nof the contaminated\
    \ wastewater at the WWTPs, (11) Direct \nconsumption of the contaminated water\
    \ distribution network \nby urban communities, (12) Increase in the COVID-19 cases\
    \ \ndue to contaminated water system in the urban region, (13) \nHuman exposer\
    \ to the COVID-19 in-house through flushing \nof the toilet and through defective\
    \ plumbing systems, (14) \nRun-off water from rain water can accelerate the COVID-19\
    \ \ncases during major events and lastly (15) COVID-19 spread-\ning through breaking\
    \ of the WHO and countries’ social dis-\ntance rules, quarantine and lack of the\
    \ proper hygiene. Proper \nhygiene, ethical following of the social distance and\
    \ quarantine \nmeasures, mobile or on-site wastewater treatment plants on \nthe\
    \ affected areas with the presence of sufficient chlorination, \nozonation or\
    \ use of UV radiation to disinfect the water before \ndischarge is an important\
    \ aspect to eradicating the COVID-\n19 in the water systems (Bhowmick et al. 2020).\
    \ Sampling, \nanalysis and interpretation of the data can assist to curb current\
    \ \nand future health crisis. KWR Dutch carried out analysis via \nDutch Municipal\
    \ Health Services (GGD) as an early warning \nsystem. The increase of the COVID-19\
    \ RNA concentration in \nthe wastewater system began with the first wave of the\
    \ patient \nhospital admission and is expected to be tracked in the second \n\
    wave. Figure 3 shows the concentration of the SAR-CoV-2 \nRNA in sewage water\
    \ in Amsterdam, Netherland (March to \nAug 2020) (Medema et al. 2020).\nWhere\
    \ the red present the RNA genetic particles in the \nwastewater system, blue present\
    \ the COVID-19 infected \ncases and grey present the number of patients in isolation\
    \ and \nhospital. Currently, RT-qPCR assays is been developed for \nSARS-CoV-2\
    \ RNA specimen clinical testing and detection in \nthe water system. Chlorine,\

    Wastewater treatment plants are designed to reduce inactive \npathogens such as\
    \ viruses, protozoa, and bacteria that are \nharmful to human beings. Inadequate\
    \ and inefficient waste-\nwater treatment plants pose a health hazard to the receiving\
    \ \nwaters, irrigation system (agriculture), recreation centres \nand source of\
    \ the drinking water. Most viruses in the water \nsystem are non-enveloped and\
    \ consist only of the nucleic \nacids (RNA or DNA) engulfed in a capsid protein.\
    \ An envel-\noped virus has an outer membrane with lipids and protein, \nrelatively\
    \ fragile and no longer infective when destroyed. \nEnvelop viruses are much sensitive\
    \ to heat, acids, pH, dis-\ninfectants and detergents, and thus not able to withstand\
    \ \nthe stomach acidity medium for a long period. Enveloped \nviruses are assumed\
    \ inactive and absent in the wastewater \nsystem. Enveloped viruses are responsible\
    \ for many high-\nprofile pandemic outbreaks like Swine Flu, Spanish Flu, \nSARS-CoV,\
    \ middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-\nCoV), Ebola and currently, the COVID-19\
    \ pandemic. Virus \nexposure to the UV radiation in form of sunlight or optimum\
    \ \nUV wavelength range of the disinfection of 100–290 nm \nfollowed by chlorination\
    \ before discharge to the receiving \nenvironment assist with denaturing and elimination\
    \ of the \nCOVID-19 in the water system. Inadequate treatment is \nwidely presented\
    \ in the ageing infrastructure of wastewater \ntreatment plants in developing\
    \ countries. This raises con-\ncern about the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission\
    \ \nvia the water systems. Figure 4 shows a virion structure of \nthe SARS-CoV-2\
    \ (W.R.C. 2020).\nThe coronavirus is enveloped in a protein spherical struc-\n\
    ture with a diameter of 120 nm. The envelope is a helical \ncapsid that contains\
    \ nucleoprotein and ribonucleic acid \n(RNA) genome. The 25 to 32 kb genome of\
    \ COVID-19 is \norganized in two large frames (ORF1b and ORF1a) coding \nfor the\
    \ replicase polyprotein followed by terminal one-third \nof the genome with region\
    \ encoding for the structure pro-\nteins (membrane, spike, envelope, and nucleocapsid\
    \ protein) \n(La Rosa et al. 2020).\nAccording to (La Rosa et al. 2020), COVID-19\
    \ was \ndetected in hospital water, tap water and domestic sewage \nfor 14 days\

    Wastewater surveillance \nor wastewater‑based epidemiology\nThe economic limits\
    \ on the medical screening for the \nSARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 worldwide are turning\
    \ to \nwastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as great poten-\ntial tools for assessing\
    \ and management of the COVID-19 \npandemic (Hart & Halden 2020a). Current studies\
    \ of the \nWBE or wastewater surveillance provide population-scale \ninformation\
    \ for the detection of the hotspot, measure the \nscope of the outbreak, provide\
    \ stakeholders with a decision \nplatform, understand the impact of the demand\
    \ in the health \nsector, track infection and measures, and provide an early \n\
    warning for re-emergence of the pandemic outbreak. The \nemerging surveillance\
    \ tool (WBE) employ modelling and \ncomputational analysis to examine the economy,\
    \ feasibility, \nopportunities, and challenges of active cases globally and \n\
    locally based on the community wastewater of asymptomatic \nand symptomatic infected\
    \ cases. The WBE surveillance of \nthe large-scale population is cheap, rapid,\
    \ with the potential \nrobust tool of tracking COVID-19 than the clinical screening\
    \ \nalthough it cannot replace the clinical screening. Signifi-\ncant cost savings\
    \ are realized on the vulnerable population \nand enhance economic recovery with\
    \ the containment of \nthe COVID-19 in the community. Effective use of the WBE\
    \ \nrequires access to the wastewater system and mostly relies \non integrated\
    \ sampling and analysis for the decision-mak-\ning process of global health surveillance.\
    \ The WBE of the \nreverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) \n\
    analysis is used to detect genetic materials in the RNA and \nis considered to\
    \ be the most reliable means of the COVID-\n19 diagnosis worldwide. Similar development\
    \ of the use of \nthe cartridges-based test is effective in the WBE purposes \n\
    although with great challenges in the wastewater treatment \nplants. The cheapest\
    \ and simplest testing technology is used \nof the paper-based rapid test kit\
    \ to detect the potential of the \nCOVID-19 carriers in the WWTPs. Cell culture\
    \ is highly \nrecommended for testing and analysis of the COVID-19 \nbecause of\
    \ concerns related to biosafety (W.R.C. 2020). The \nimportant limitation of the\
    \ WBE is the inability to identify \nthe specific infected individual and their\
    \ specific location \n(Hart & Halden 2020a). The WBE aid in providing popula-\n\
    tion-wide information and community health to the analysis \nof the antimicrobial\
    \ resistance genes (ARGs) in the influ-\nent’s wastewater and typically through\
    \ the qPCR technology. \nThe ethics in using WBE is low since no individual data\
    \ is \ncollected. However, privacy issues in a particular commu-\nnity should\
    \ be accorded for potential stigmatisation. The key \nchallenges that need to\
    \ be tackled in the WBE surveillance \nof the water and wastewater concerning\
    \ the COVID-19 are \n(i) non-existence biomarkers discovery pipeline for biologi-\n\
    cal and chemical markers, (ii) account for the temporary \npopulation size fluctuations\
    \ for an accurate estimate of the \npopulation, (iii) need for the biomarker extraction\
    \ technol-\nogy for the complex wastewater matrix, and lastly (iv) lack \nof the\
    \ analytical tool that covers the sensitive, selective and \nmulti-residual analysis\
    \ and cost-effective over a wide range \nof the biomarker group (Sims & Kasprzyk-Hordern\
    \ 2020).\nMathematical modelling of the COVID‑19\nSARS‑COV‑2 load into the wastewater\

    \ \nin wastewater\nThe mass balance was used to estimate the prevalence of \n\
    the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the total numbers of the RNA \ncopies in wastewater\
    \ per day by RT-qPCR. The number of \nthe SARS-CoV-2 copies in the solid stool\
    \ and on the infected \nperson is calculated to determine the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in\
    \ \nwastewater clinical samples (Ahmed et al. 2020):\nThe variability and uncertainty\
    \ in the independent vari-\nables are incorporated using the Monte Carlos simulation\

    where R is the initial rate of decay, Q10 is the rate of change \nfor each increment\

    \ Prediction mortality rate using \nmachine learning algorithms (decision tree,\

    \ monitor the emerging contaminants that have global \nhealth potential and community\

    \ materials is promising for the detection of \nwaterborne pathogens in water\
    \ samples (Bilal et al. 2020). \nThe development of the biosensor for prognosis\

    \ (Bhalla et al. 2020):\n(i) \nHigh selectivity and ability to exclusively detect\

    \ to affinity, spacing and specificity \nof the target probes in self-assembled\
    \ mono-layers or \nbiorecognition elements on the sensor surface. For the \nCOVID-19,\
    \ the sensor should be able to detect bio-\nmarkers at a low concentration and\
    \ produce easily \nreadable output. The specificity and sensitivity of the \n\
    biosensor towards the early detection of the COVID-19 \nare the key aspect in\
    \ the innovation and disruption of \nthe bio-sensors.\n(iii) Quick response time\
    \ of the diagnosis tool should be \nrapid and of paramount importance.\n(iv) Multiplexity\
    \ system should be allowed to detect the \nmultiple biomarkers of the COVID-19\
    \ with accurate, \nquick and early detection of the disease. This can be \nachieved\
    \ with physical isolation of different areas of \nthe sensor surface.\n(v) A trade-off\
    \ of the multi-mode sensors and increasing \nmore than one mode of sensing and\
    \ physical dimension \nand computational time of sensing could provide cross-\n\
    validation of the sensing results with accuracy.\n(vi) To avoid contamination,\
    \ a single-use (disposable sen-\nsors system) of the sensors is needed to avoid\
    \ contami-\nnation and sensing system. Integrating the sensors with \nthe mobile\
    \ app provide advantages of cost-effectiveness \nand connectivity and periodic\

    \ be easy to use and this \nensures that a large number of testing kits are produced\
    \ \nfor self-testing and preparedness of the self-isolation.\n(viii) \nIt is effective\
    \ to have low-cost bio-sensors that \ncommunities can afford and easily available\
    \ at shops \nselves i.e. disposable electrodes such as paper-based \nand screen-printed\
    \ electrodes. Other biosensors are \nelectronic sensor (field-effect-transistors-(FET),\

    \ direct visualization, characterization and \ndiagnosis of the virus using electron\
    \ microscopy (EM), \nX-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy \n(AFM).\n\
    (ix) The COVID-19 have raised the manufacturing demand \nof the sensors and thus\
    \ this call for low cost, high avail-\nable sensors that cover the total population\
    \ and geo-\ngraphical areas. The advancement of 3D printing and \nmachine moulding\
    \ can help increase production levels.\n(x) Compatibility of a biosensor to the\

    \ to track and identify the patient \nlocations. This gives no reasonable privacy-conscious\
    \ \nsociety where the app simply broadcasts phone numbers \nand names with phones\
    \ log information. The most reason-\nable system uses the unique user-ID for each\

    \ places needs to be improved with the \nuse of the GPS location for contact mapping\
    \ of the infected \npatients. Bluetooth low energy technology can only track \n\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain
    Interoperability Solution with Event-B Guzmán Llambías and 2 more April 03, 2024
    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications
    Of Text-T... Mijat Kustudic and 1 more April 02, 2024 SORA is a text-to-video
    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges
    in Robot Grasping and Manipulation for Aspiring Researche... Claudio Zito April
    02, 2024 Robot grasping and manipulation represent pivotal aspects of robotics
    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s
    portrayal of robotics, we bridge the conceptual gap between fiction and ongoing
    real-world technical research, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for
    students interested in robotics. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 509 510 Next →

    \ Systems (CPS) have seen a dramatic increase in research and real-world application\
    \ in recent \nyears. Many parts of our everyday lives have been affected, including\
    \ electrical power systems, oil and gas delivery, \ntransportation networks, medical\
    \ equipment, home appliances, and a host of other areas. For example, many critical\
    \ \ninfrastructure and life support equipment are relying on these kinds of systems.\
    \ As a result, they are required to be \ncompletely secure and resistant to all\
    \ forms of assaults, which is almost unachievable for any real-world system. This\
    \ \npaper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security\
    \ threats in CPSs, and security challenges in \nCPSs, have been discussed \n \n\
    Keywords – Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Information\
    \ Technology (IT) \n \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nCyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) [1] are\
    \ a new study topic that has the potential to bring together the physical and\
    \ digital \nworlds. In order to integrate the physical and digital worlds, these\
    \ systems use integrated components to perform tasks \ncollectively. CPSs have\
    \ grown more dispersed as a result of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increased\
    \ complexity of \njobs, thus it is vital to design ubiquitous CPSs capable of\
    \ providing timely service delivery. A distributed CPS with \nmultiresolution\
    \ dynamism and connectivity allows for the efficient, reliable, safe and secure\
    \ administration of monitoring \nand management of physical objects in the real\
    \ world. Innovations such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), \ninteractive\
    \ platforms, and cloud technology have emerged in the construction of CPSs after\
    \ the merger of CPSs and IoT. \nThe potential of service-oriented CPSs has been\
    \ highlighted by the need of devices in CPSs to work together on both a \ncyber\
    \ and a physical scale. While the service-oriented methodology may be used to\
    \ create dispersed real-time CPSs that \ncan interact with real-world objects\
    \ in real-time, it is not adequate to fully realise complete distributed CPSs\
    \ that take into \nconsideration the interrelations between virtual and real elements.\
    \ A distributed embedded computing framework depends \non agents that are aware\
    \ of their context is therefore more appealing because it is possible to incorporate\
    \ various attributes \ninto agents and achieve distributed cloud computing with\
    \ improved coordination and interconnectivity between \nindependent and inhomogeneous\
    \ agents. When it comes to CPSs, context-awareness is a must, since this new technology\
    \ \nrelies heavily on sensors, resources, adaptability, and augmentation. Partial\
    \ observability in CPSs is a given, given the \ndynamic nature of distributed\
    \ CPSs domains. As a result, in order to get high model performance while using\
    \ ontology as \nthe underlying semantic technology, it is necessary to use uncertainty\
    \ modelling methodologies. \nThere are substantial challenges to the security\
    \ and privacy protection of CPS because of the complexity of CPS and its \nheterogeneity.\
    \ Cyber-physical interactions have made assessing threats and vulnerabilities\
    \ more challenging, and new \nsecurity concerns have arisen. Because the assaults\
    \ may come from various CPS components, tracing and examining them \nis particularly\
    \ complex. The construction of defensive systems requires an in-depth study of\
    \ the vulnerabilities, threats, and \nassaults. Identifying gaps, weak linkages,\
    \ and new avenues for investigation will be made possible by a review of current\
    \ \nCPS privacy and security measures. This paper focuses on security analysis\
    \ in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security \nthreats in CPSs, and security\
    \ challenges in CPSs, have been discussed. The remaining part of the paper has\
    \ been organized \nas follows. Section II focusses on the background analysis\
    \ of the paper. Section III focuses on a critical survey of the \nsecurity of\
    \ CPSs. Section IV finally draws conclusions to the paper and presents suggestions\
    \ for future studies.  \n \n \n \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                        \

    \ (Cyber Physical Systems) are IT structures integrated into real-world applications.\
    \ There are sensors and actuators \nincluded in these systems. Advances in information\
    \ and communications technology (ICTs) have resulted in a rise in the \ninterconnection\
    \ between physical processes. \n \nReal-life Application of CPSs \nIt is the current\
    \ iteration of instrumentation and control systems that can constantly monitor\
    \ the physical environment. \nCPSs are becoming more important in a wide range\
    \ of industries, including energy, aviation, and healthcare. As a very \nsignificant\
    \ and symbolic consideration, it is contingent on the technology used. An example\
    \ of a CPS is the SCADA, \nwhich is employed in CI, e.g., smart/intelligent grids\
    \ and industrial control systems, and wearable and implanted gadgets \n(utilized\
    \ in medical care). There are so many versions of CPSs that it would be impossible\
    \ to mention them all here, but in \nthis article, we'll focus on four examples\
    \ (see Table 1) of how CPSs might be used. \n \nTable 1. Examples of CPSs applications\
    \ \nApplication \nDetails  \nIndustrial Control \nSystems (ICS) \nNuclear power\
    \ facilities, water and sewage treatment plants, and irrigation systems all use\
    \ ICS \n(SCADA or distribution systems) to better their control and output. We\
    \ use a variety of \ncontrollers in ICS, including PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller)\
    \ [2]. You may use this \ngadget to accomplish a variety of goals by combining\
    \ its many features. A variety of actuators \nand sensors are being employed to\
    \ link this gadget to the real-world. This system has both \nwireless and cable\
    \ communication capabilities that may be employed depending on the \nenvironment.\
    \ Using PC systems, it is also possible to monitor and control systems in a control\
    \ \ncentre. \nSmart Grid Systems \nSmart grids are the next generation of grids\
    \ for producing energy, even though they have been \nin use for decades. By giving\
    \ consumers more control over their energy use at the local scale, it \nis both\
    \ economically and ecologically viable. In addition, it improves pollution management,\
    \ \nglobal load balance, and saves energy at the national scale. \nClinical Devices\
    \ \nIn an aim to render between medical care, clinical gadgets have been enhanced\
    \ with a \ncombination of cyber and physical capabilities. In order to help patients,\
    \ these medical gadgets \nmay either be implanted in the body or worn as wearable\
    \ devices. These gadgets are \nintelligent, and they can connect with other gadgets\
    \ using wireless technology. A programmer \nis responsible for establishing this\
    \ line of communication, which is necessary for performing \nsoftware updates\
    \ and configuration changes on the devices. Patients who use a wearable \ngadget\
    \ are more likely to keep track of their daily routines. \nSmart Vehicles \nSustainable,\
    \ fuel-efficient, cleaner and more convenient: these are the characteristics that\
    \ \ndistinguish smart cars from traditional automobiles. Electronic Control Units\
    \ (ECUs), a system \nof up to 70 computer networks, allowed these improvements.\
    \ ECUs are responsible for \noverseeing and controlling a variety of functions,\
    \ including machine emission controls, \nrecreation controls (audiovisual and\
    \ radio players), braking control, and recreational elements \n(cruise control,\
    \ and closing and window opening). To help alleviate traffic congestion and \n\
    prevent accidents on the road and in the area, these kinds of advancements are\
    \ critical in the \npresent era's technological landscape. \n \nDevelopments in\
    \ Clinical CPSs \nWe have analysed the wearable technology and IMDs, and now it's\
    \ time to talk about the relevance of CPSs in clinical \nuses, such as insulin\
    \ pumps, ventilation systems, and patient surveillance systems that are software-intensive.\
    \ Many \nindividuals are interested in these medical gadgets because they promise\
    \ to make their lives more comfortable and stress-\nfree (via determining causal\
    \ factors of diseases or treating diseases). Because of this, new difficulties\
    \ and possibilities for \nthe scientific community arise when big changes are\
    \ made to these devices. The following (see Table 2) are some of the \nmost common\
    \ developments in medical instruments: \nOverdosing should not be possible with\
    \ a properly set PCA device since it is meant to only deliver a certain number\
    \ of \ndoses, no matter how frequently the button is pushed. This safety system,\
    \ on the other hand, is insufficient to meet the \nneeds of all patients. Misprogrammed\
    \ pumps, pump developers who overestimate a patient's maximal dosage, drugs placed\
    \ \nincorrectly into the device, and PCA-by-proxy are just a few of the possible\
    \ causes of overdoses that may lead to death or \nserious illness in many patients.\
    \ It is not possible to address all of the clinical practise situations that PCA\
    \ infusion pumps \nare implicated in, even with established precautions like medication\
    \ libraries and programmable thresholds. Because of \nthis, we'll need more effective\
    \ medical gadgets to examine people in the near future (equipment are also required\
    \ to \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                                                   \

    \ \n \n136 \n \ndetermine the patient's medication concentration). Medical gadgets\
    \ are also increasingly being used to monitor a patient's \nheart rate, respiratory\
    \ rate, sugar levels, perceived stress, and body temperature. Despite this, since\
    \ they lack real-time \ndiagnostic ability, these instruments are limited to a\
    \ store-and-forward mode of operation and performance. Vital signs can \nbe monitored\
    \ in real time using closed-loop technologies in physiology, although this requires\
    \ continual attention. \n \nTable 2.  Common developments in medical instruments\
    \ \n \nDevelopment \nDetails \nNew software-enabled \nfunctionality \nEmbedded\
    \ system concepts [3] are used to bring new technology into medical equipment,\
    \ \nsuch as robotic surgery and proton therapy treatment, using software-based\
    \ design. Real-time \nprocessing of high-resolution pictures and haptic feedback\
    \ is required for this (robotic \nsurgery). In contrast, proton therapy treatment\
    \ is one of the most digital therapies and \nrequires one of the biggest clinical\
    \ device systems in the world. Patients with cancer get \nprecise treatment directions\
    \ from a cyclotron using a proton beam that give exact dosages of \nradiation.\
    \ Beam planning and projecting might potentially be disrupted by the fact that\
    \ the \nsame beam is disseminated to several patients and must be transferred\
    \ from place to site. \nResearch on the safety of proton beam machines has mostly\
    \ focused on one type in the last \ndecade, namely, devices that must be turned\
    \ off in an emergency. One of the key issues \nconfronting medical device makers\
    \ and the industry is how to properly analyse and evaluate \nsuch massive and\
    \ complicated structures. \nEnhanced connectivity of \nclinical gadgets \nNowadays,\
    \ health gadgets are connected with network connections since they increasingly\
    \ \ndepend on software. The usage of such interconnected healthcare devices allows\
    \ the creation \nof more decentralized structures of clinical devices, which have\
    \ to be planned properly and \nstructured to perform particular functions. Electronic\
    \ health records (EHRs) might be \nemployed to save patient data via the localized\
    \ or distant interconnection of these clinical \ndevices for tracking patients\
    \ or for tele-ICU telemonitoring in Electronic Health Records \n(EHR). As a consequence\
    \ of these limitations, novel treatment approaches and enhanced \npatient safety\
    \ may be achieved via the use of such healthcare devices in the present context.\
    \ \nMedical Device Plug-and-and-Play (MD PnP) interoperability approach is a standard\
    \ open \nframework for scalable and safe interconnections of clinical devices,\
    \ and for enhancing \npatient safety and efficacy within the healthcare system.\
    \ \nPhysiologically closed-\nloop systems \nIn most clinical facilities, a nurse\
    \ is assigned to keep an eye on the systems (or more than \none). During an operation,\
    \ an anaesthesiologist manages the patient's sedation and decides \nwhen to alter\
    \ the sedative stream. This reliance on \"person in the loop\" may jeopardise\
    \ \npatient safety, which is why some in the clinical community worry about it.\
    \ Nurses who are \noften overburdened and under tremendous time constraints may\
    \ overlook a critical warning \nsign. There may be times when nurses are unable\
    \ to care for numerous patients \nsimultaneously; however, they can operate a\
    \ device, which will be a significant assistance to \nthe nurse and enhance patient\
    \ safety and care. Nonetheless, even though the machine \n(computer) can never\
    \ replace the caregivers (in emotion), it may significantly reduce the \ncaregiver's\
    \ labour by bringing attention to the caregiver only when anything out of the\
    \ \nnormal occurs. The medical device industry has long employed case-based on\
    \ closed-loop \nphysiologic control. PCA (Patient-Controlled Analgesia) is a medical\
    \ condition that takes use \nof the closed loop technique [4]. Pain treatment\
    \ after surgery is usually achieved using PCA \ninfusion pumps. PCA pumps allow\
    \ patients to request a dosage at any time, rather than \nrelying on a caregiver's\
    \ set schedule for delivery. \nContinuous Monitoring \nand Care \nResidential\
    \ care, supported living, telehealth, and medical monitoring of sports activities\
    \ are \nbecoming more popular as an alternative to in-hospital treatment because\
    \ of their lower cost. \nRemote monitoring of patient and bodily functions is\
    \ feasible via mobile surveillance and \nhome automation. \n \nCyber, Network\
    \ and Data/Information Security  \nData security, of which cyber-security is a\
    \ subset, encompasses a broader range of concerns. Many different methods, \n\
    technologies or practises may be utilised to safeguard a firm’s networks and computers\
    \ against unauthorized accessibility, \ndamage or hazards. When it comes to protecting\
    \ both real and virtual material, InfoSec ensures that no one can get their \n\
    hands on it. In contrast to cyber-security, the objective of information security\
    \ (InfoSec) is to safeguard data in any format. \nWhen it comes to cyber dangers\
    \ like viruses, malware, and Trojan horses, network security is responsible for\
    \ protecting the \ncompany's IT infrastructure from all types of cyberattacks\
    \ including hacker and denial-of-service attacks, hosts and \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669\

    \ Various elements of the network security framework work collaboratively to keep\
    \ us safe. A firewall, Intrusion \nDetection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS), Virtual\
    \ Private Network (VPN), and anti-virus, are all shared security measures \non\
    \ most systems. \n \n \nIII. \nSECURITY ANALYSIS IN CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)\
    \ \nSecurity in CPSs \nIn this section, we provide various instances to demonstrate\
    \ the criticality of safety to the CPS process. Cryptography, \naccess management,\
    \ penetration testing, and a slew of other concepts fall under the umbrella of\
    \ security control (used in IT \nmodels). When it concerns safeguarding an ICT's\
    \ infrastructure, they play a critical role [5]. There will be a lot of demand\
    \ \nfor error-free cyber physical systems in the near future. There will be many\
    \ more assaults like these in the future, therefore \nit's important to be prepared\
    \ now. Uses of CPSs as shown in Table 3 need various levels of security. \n \n\
    Table 3. Security breach of CPSs Applications \nCPSs Application \nDetails \n\
    Nuclear energy \nBased on the facts, it might be disastrous if the CPS lacks enough\
    \ protection. In the case of a \nnuclear facility, for example, the safety of\
    \ the CPS might be compromised, posing a global \nsecurity risk. As recently as\
    \ 2010, Iran's nuclear power reactors were targeted by an assault known \nas Stuxnet.\
    \ Big industrial control systems also have a large number of outdated systems.\
    \ In fact, \nthis also holds true. Over the past decade, several individuals have\
    \ worked on \"lightweight \ncryptographic mechanisms\" (mechanisms that make data\
    \ safe, accessible, and secure). However, \nmuch work remains to be done in each\
    \ of these areas. Make sure to take into account that some \nsecurity level is\
    \ preferable to none at all. An ICS's security is critical, and researchers must\
    \ do \ntheir share to ensure it. \nSmart Grid \nSecurity \nIf smart grid security\
    \ is breached, users might lose particular services and the utility agencies \n\
    might lose particular funds. It is also possible to target smart grids from a\
    \ distance, which might \nresult in widespread power outages. For example, malfunctioning\
    \ medical devices, information \nloss at the data center, and also enhanced crime\

    \ security of Smart Grid CPSs is fundamental (also to safeguard user data \nwithin\
    \ a system) \nPatient safety \nThe safety of patients might be jeopardised if\
    \ hacker-targeted wearables and IMDs are not \nadequately guarded. Licensing authorities\
    \ must be able to gain access to and utilize datasets, they \nhave to have the\
    \ capabilities to recognize, modifying, updating and ensuring that gadgets are\
    \ \naccessible to them. As a result, ensuring the safety of a medical app's users'\
    \ and patients' personal \ninformation is of paramount importance. \nAutomobile\
    \ \nindustry \nAutomobile manufacturers are always looking for innovative ways\
    \ to improve the usability and \ncomfort of their vehicles for their consumers.\
    \ Researchers aren't always thinking about safety \nwhen they create vehicles,\
    \ but that's a good thing to keep in mind. Security safeguards the \nvehicle's\
    \ capacity to continue operating in the event of a minor collision. In contrast,\
    \ safety was \nnot a segment of the design, but rather an added feature. For the\
    \ vehicle’s novel element to work, \nthey must be able to connect wirelessly and\
    \ physically. For the most part, smart cars rely on these \ntwo technologies to\
    \ protect them from most security breaches or attacks. We must find ways to \n\
    defend ourselves that are both secure and effective. \n \nIn order to adequately\
    \ safeguard CPSs, the underlying technologies should accomplish particular performance\
    \ \nnecessities. This allows for the implementation of proven safety systems and\
    \ standards. \n \nSecurity Parameters \nFor CPSs, there are a number of variables\
    \ to consider in order to ensure, which the system they protect are safe enough\
    \ \n(actual-work application). In order to protect CPSs, we must adhere to strict\
    \ security guidelines. \nIn recent years, it has become more evident that the\
    \ reliability of control functions is a critical component. The most \nsignificant\
    \ distinction between control schemes and IT security is the absence of patching\
    \ or updating requirements for \ncontrol systems. The process of upgrading a computer\
    \ may take months, for example. Stopping an industrial computer \nevery time a\
    \ new security patch is released is not worth the effort. After a software upgrade\
    \ on March 7, 2008, a gadget \ndesigned to monitor chemical data and diagnostic\
    \ datasets from the plant’s corporate systems began operations again. This \n\
    resulted in the shutdown of a nuclear power facility by accident. There was no\
    \ evidence that water reservoirs had \ndecreased, which meant that nuclear fuel\
    \ rods could not be kept cold. When the machine was rebooted, it generated this\
    \ \nerror. Autonomy is critical, but so is the requirement for decision-making\
    \ that occurs in real time (another management \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669         \

    \ Much attention has been paid to availability as a security concern. The real-time\
    \ operational \nenvironment, on the other hand, is more stringent than that of\
    \ most other IT systems. \nThe last portion of the report discusses the various\
    \ security factors and standards for CPSs (i.e., in intelligent control \nsystem,\
    \ intelligent grid system, etc.). In the sub-section below, we will discuss the\
    \ various forms of security threats in CPSs \n(i.e., intelligent grid system,\
    \ intelligent clinical devices, intelligent control schemes, etc.). \n \nSecurity\
    \ Threats in CPSs \nOur discussion of the security standards for four distinct\
    \ CPS applications may be found in the preceding section. For each \nof these\
    \ applications, we will now discuss some probable attacks. In this sub-section,\
    \ we're going to discuss about various \ndifferent cyber physical assaults. \n\
    \ \nReal-world cyber physical threats \nCPSs systems could be attacked by Physical\
    \ (P), Cyber-Physical (CP) and Cyber (C) threats, and how to prevent them [6].\
    \ \nThere are just a few recorded public assaults, and it's quite difficult to\
    \ get back or figure out exactly what occurred in the \nimmediate aftermath. In\
    \ this chapter, attacks are categorised according to the location of the injuries.\
    \ The term \"cyber\" \nrefers to assaults on computers that do not compromise\
    \ sensors or actuators. The term \"physical\" refers to assaults that \ntarget\
    \ specific physical components. When it comes to cyber-physical threats, on the\
    \ contrary, they are threats that attack \nphysical elements through the employment\
    \ of cyber elements. But extortion control systems have been around for a long\
    \ \ntime, so this is nothing new. Terrorism and physical violence are being employed\
    \ as a means of extortion in many nations. \nBecause they are quicker, cheaper,\
    \ and do not have to be constricted by distances, cyberattacks are a logical next\
    \ stage in \nthe development of physical assaults. The following are examples\
    \ of cyber and physical assaults against CPS that may now \nbe documented: \n\
    \ \nCyber attacks on cyber physical systems \nTable 4 presents the cyber-attacks\
    \ of CPSs. \nTable 4. Cyber-attacks of CPSs. \n \nAttack \nDetails \nIndustrial\
    \ Control \nSystem Attacks \nIran was hit by a \"Stuxnet\" assault in 2010 that\
    \ damaged many nuclear reactors. Iran has recently \nbeen the target of many cyberattacks\
    \ by cybercriminals from the United States. There have been \ntwo kinds of attacks\
    \ discovered against ICS. \n1. Communication protocols: In several cases, attackers\
    \ exploited holes in communication \nsystems. A SCADA system [7], for instance,\
    \ demonstrated how to evade the domain \nresolution protocol. \n2. Espionage:\
    \ Hacking ICS hacks like DuQu and Flame may be exploited to spy on \nindividuals.\
    \ A number of ICS networks were detected in the Mideast in 2012 by Flame, \nfor\
    \ example The primary purpose of this spyware was to steal confidential information\
    \ \nfrom businesses, such as their locations and the passwords they entered into\
    \ their \ncomputers. \nIn many nations, intruders who are not authorized are attacking\
    \ them on a daily basis. At this \npoint, governments are employing these assaults\
    \ as a weaponry to inflict maximum harm on their \nadversary (the enemy). \nSmart\
    \ Grid CPS \nAttack \nCPS assault on a Central Processing System (CPS). The most\
    \ frequent occurrence is a total power \noutage. Smart grids are vulnerable to\
    \ cyberattacks, which might result in a complete blackout in a \nnation. It was\
    \ quite significant whenever it happened in USA and Europe a few times over the\
    \ past \n10 years. \nClinical CPS attack \nIn a distributed framework, insider\
    \ threats, spies and other types of threats are probable. This is a \nmajor danger.\
    \ Medical gadgets may be tampered with or hacked by an insider, allowing him to\
    \ \ncontrol the machinery in any way he sees fit. The wireless transmissions that\
    \ medical gadgets use \nto keep individuals healthier might easily be jammed by\
    \ an invader. In this case, the gadget would \nbe rendered useless and would not\
    \ be able to render the necessary treatments. \nIntelligent Vehicles \nAttack\
    \ \nTaking control of a motor vehicle or automobiles from a specific distance\
    \ or through an assault \nfrom the outside is a major security issue. An assailant\
    \ might take control of any car, which could \nresult in a major traffic incident.\
    \ \n \nPhysical Threats on CPSs \nPhysical assaults that were popular in the past\
    \ include the following: i) A Pennsylvania (USA) water filtration facility was\
    \ \nhacked by intruders in 2006 and employed as its own unlicensed application\

    \ Machines compromised with the Slammer worm at the Davis Besse power company\
    \ in Ohio, took down \nsecurity surveillance system in January 2003. iii) the\
    \ Maroochy Shire Council in Queensland, Australia, was attacked in \n2000, on\
    \ the sewage control system (that was undertaken by disgruntled ex-worker of the\
    \ contractor company, which has \nestablished the control systems). In this part,\
    \ we'll look at an example of a threat framework in CPS. \n \nAdversary Framework\
    \ in CPS \nIdentifying potential threats to a system's security requires an in-depth\
    \ investigation. An adversary model can be used to \nassess the scope and severity\
    \ of a problem. Cybercriminals have been breaking into computers all over the\
    \ world for the \nbetter part of the last decade or so (even in control models).\
    \ Control systems compromised with malware might not work as \nplanned. From a\
    \ safety perspective, these attacks are critical because they are the result of\
    \ unauthorised access to control \nsystems' computers and networks. Attacks by\
    \ insiders can occur even when control networks are completely isolated from \n\
    the public Internet and other networks. Currently, targeted computer attacks are\
    \ primarily perpetrated by disgruntled \nemployees. Most of the time, these employees\
    \ don't collaborate with each other. \" Larger, better-coordinated groups can\
    \ do \nmore damage, but these individuals may not. As a major issue in CPS, this\
    \ one necessitates a solution that is both practical \nand realistic. \nCriminal\
    \ groups and terrorists may try to access the security models. Presently, there\
    \ are no proofs that terrorists and \nactivists have used computer threats to\
    \ access controllers. Although criminal clusters may be involved, there is some\
    \ \nevidence. CPS initiatives aren't new, but they're gaining in popularity these\
    \ days because of how much money they can \nmake. Iran and Iraq, for example,\
    \ have been subjected to physical attacks in the last few years as a result of\
    \ this tactic. \nCyberattacks on other nations' physical infrastructure will become\
    \ more commonplace in the near future. Table 5 depicts \nthe concept of attacks\
    \ and consequences of attacks.  \n \nTable 5. Concepts of Attacks and Consequences\
    \ \nConcept \nDetails  \nAttacks  \nResonance assaults on control systems may\
    \ be used by attackers to gain access (i.e., threats that are \nnon-feasible in\
    \ more conventional information technology schemes). Someone tampered with some\
    \ of \nthe sensors or controls, causing physical systems to oscillate at a natural\
    \ frequency.  \nConsequences of \nAttacks  \nWe're not aware of anybody who's\
    \ done research on the potential consequences of assaults on critical \ninfrastructures.\
    \ A person may get entry to a control scheme that does not correspond to them\
    \ via \nSCADA security reports, which may look like overreaction. The majority\
    \ of controllers have \nsafeguards in place to prevent catastrophic failures.\
    \ \n \nSecurity challenges in cyber physical systems \nAll of these terms, as\
    \ well as others, are intertwined in this piece of writing (paper). We define\
    \ challenges as unanswered \nproblems, and our goal is to entice individuals to\
    \ do more investigation to discover solutions. An internal (security) \nweakness\
    \ that may be exploited by intruders is referred to as a \"vulnerability.\" Things\
    \ that potentially harm a system are \nknown as threats. \n \nOverall  CPSs security\
    \ Isues \nSecurity based on Design  \nSince most CPS are not linked to other systems\
    \ like the web, they are not meant to be secure. CPS are not linked to other \n\
    networks, which implies that cybersecurity isn't taken into concern while designing\
    \ them. Keeping people secure, then, was \nmostly a matter of physical security.\
    \ \n \n Cyber Physical Security \nKeeping people secure, then, was mostly a matter\
    \ of physical security. Designers of CPSs must rethink security from a \ncyber\
    \ and physical perspective if they are to succeed. Our ability to foresee and\
    \ prevent new cyber-attacks which have \nphysical implications should be improved.\
    \ There is a need to develop infrastructure for resolution components (cyber-\n\
    physical technologies), which have hitherto been dismissed.  \n \nReal-Timeliness\
    \ Nature \nIn case a certain criterion in real-time is not reached, it has a direct\
    \ impact on the condition of defence. In order to survive \nan assault, networks\
    \ rely on CPS to make timely judgments. CPS security that considers the interplay\
    \ between real and \nvirtual factors may be shown to the whole globe. Better risk\
    \ evaluation and threat detection may be achieved by using this \nmethod. Since\
    \ cryptographic techniques must be put on top of these approaches to facilitate\
    \ real-time interoperability, \nwhich is what ought to occur. \n \n \n \nISSN:\

    \ \n \nUncoordinated Changes \nThe CPS employs a large number of employees. Those\
    \ who manufacture, use, own, and operate goods are all included, as \nare those\
    \ who work for them. They need to be well managed, even if their jobs and responsibilities\
    \ are distinct. This shift \nwill need the attention of many personnel and several\
    \ CPS divisions (an issue that we must not ignore). Stakeholders in a \nCPS community\
    \ should coordinate their efforts at some point. Upgrading hardware, upgrading\
    \ or modifying software, and \nintroducing new features are all examples of methods\
    \ to improve things. A country's security may be jeopardised if \nunanticipated\
    \ improvements to CPSs security (i.e., novel flaws) were to occur. \nIndustrial\
    \ Control System Issues \nChange Management \nNumerous Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ gadgets must be removed or modified in ICS environments. Replacement, \nmodification,\
    \ or deletion of these systems is required (at one place). ICS system updates,\
    \ for example, must be scheduled \nmeticulously in order to minimise issues. The\
    \ ICS system's security plan may change without the awareness of many \ninvestors;\
    \ therefore, we must organize change controls in order to monitor and prevent\
    \ security-based changes within \nCPSs. \nMalicious Insider \nDue to the fact\
    \ that the assault originates from inside the organisation, tracking down and\
    \ stopping a hostile insider are very \ndifficult tasks. Internal attacks like\
    \ those in Maroochy’s sewage system and water supply, or Stuxnet, might be launched\
    \ by \nan insider who has the trust and inside knowledge necessary to carry out\
    \ the attack. This is only one illustration of what \nmay be accomplished (via\
    \ a USB stick). Insiders may unintentionally utilise virus-attacked computers\
    \ or USB sticks, \namounting in ICS entry points being made available to unauthorised\
    \ users. Finding out who is an internal attacker has been \nthe main difficulty\
    \ that many independent researchers have neglected or ignored. \nSecure Integration\
    \ \nTo prevent new security issues, new components must be integrated into existing\
    \ systems in a secure manner. It's important \nto keep in mind that the ICS depends\
    \ heavily on out-of-date technology that might be susceptible. In order to make\
    \ ICS as \nsafe as possible, all of the old components must be removed and new,\
    \ safer ones installed. So, short-term fixes are needed \nto avoid any difficulties\
    \ with ICS. \n \nSmart grids challenges \nTable 6 presents the challenges in the\
    \ smart grid. \nTable 6. Smart grid challenges \nChallenge \nDetails \nChange\
    \ \nManagement  \nSmart grid adjustments aren't any simpler to cope with than\
    \ ICS updates, but they're also not much \neasier. Even while smart grids are\
    \ increasingly complex and include a greater number of people, \nthey are unable\
    \ to adapt to changes. It necessitates the use of change management in order to\
    \ keep \nsmart grids healthy. \nTwo-Way \nCommunications \nThe Advanced Metering\
    \ Infrastructure (AMI) [8] in an intelligent grid allows for two-way \ncommunication.\
    \ Consumers' residences are less of a target for physical attacks since AMI smart\
    \ \nmetres can connect with utility providers that are nearby, unlike the power\
    \ grid. Since the \nintroduction of smart grids, keeping these gadgets secure\
    \ has grown increasingly complex. \nAccess \nControl \nMechanisms  \nWith a vast\
    \ reach and many investors, smart grids require strong access control systems\
    \ to keep \nthem safe. It is critical to keep watch on and regulate any potential\
    \ accessibility to the smart grid \nsystem, data, or gadgets. Whenever possible,\
    \ it is important to empower the individuals or \norganisations that are meant\
    \ to assist. \nPrivacy Concerns \nAnxieties about the usage of personal information\
    \ are common. Increasing use of smart grids has \nmade this an issue for many\
    \ individuals. Moreover, it is essential to provide anonymization \nstrategies\
    \ to prevent attackers from deducing trends or encrypted information to disclose\
    \ sensitive \ninformation. The term for this is \"anonymization.\" As a result,\
    \ we must ensure that the methods \nwe design can encode and consolidate data\
    \ securely. \nExplicit Trust \nWe should just not put any faith in the perceived\
    \ data or directives that have been transmitted in \nthis circumstance. Instead,\
    \ new methods must be devised to recognise bogus data and actions that \nare not\
    \ permitted. Because smart grids are so big, it might be difficult to employ algorithms\
    \ that \njust search for faults to identify FDI assaults. \nComprehensive \nSecurity\
    \ \nSmart grids benefit from having high levels of security. Even at the lowest\
    \ levels, it's a problem \n(as a result of limited capacities in devices on the\
    \ lower level). There might be variations in the \nnumber of securities, which\
    \ has to be in place at every level as a consequence. Several academic \nresearchers\
    \ have to come up with compact technologies in order to achieve this. Encryption\
    \ is also \ncritical for maintaining the privacy and security of data at all layers\
    \ of the smart grid. This is to \nensure that there is no security breach at any\
    \ time. \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                                                \

    Usability vs. \nSecurity \nWhen the patient's condition is serious, changing the\
    \ unit would be impossible. Someone with \nIMD may find himself in a position\
    \ where another medical professional need immediate \nassistance. So, if the providers\

    \ them to transform IMD, thereby having IMD might be problematic. \nMore Code\

    \ prohibitively expensive to install. In order to make \nIMDs more secure, their\
    \ code may grow in size, making them more susceptible to be seized. \nBecause\
    \ of this, it is imperative that the cryptographic processes affecting the functionality\
    \ and \ncost of medical equipment (that are accessible to patients) be as low\
    \ as feasible. \nLimited Resources \nIt takes a lot of power (a finite resource)\
    \ to run cryptographic methods, and that power must be \nmaintained for a long\
    \ period (long time). Surgery-dependent implants, for example, should last no\
    \ \nmore than a decade or two before they need to be replaced (at least). Additionally,\
    \ many assaults \nattempt to deplete a device's battery, which is known as a Denial\
    \ of Service (DoS) threats, to \nprevent it from effective operations. It is fundamental\
    \ to remember that gadget receiver and \nevaluates signals from users who do not\
    \ want to receive all of it. This could be a discharge on the \nbattery system\

    \ by enabling it to \ntreat people in the most appropriate method for them at\
    \ the moment. The loop should be \nsecurely and swiftly closed in this manner.\
    \ \nSecurity and Privacy \nBecause MCPSs gather health records and organize the\
    \ information they acquire, security \nand privacy are of the utmost importance.\
    \ As a result, it's critical that no unauthorised party \nhas access to or alters\
    \ their data. A patient's privacy, discrimination, abuse, or even physical \n\
    harm might result from such an act. \nCertifiability \nMCPS requires a low-cost\
    \ method of demonstrating that biomedical device software is safe \nand dependable,\
    \ e.g., clinical device certifications. \nExecutable clinical \nworkflows \nMCPS\
    \ may be built and deployed fast in order to deliver effective medical services\
    \ for a \n(particular) patient since more and more healthcare systems are connecting\
    \ and working \ntogether. With MCPS, patients' security is the foremost concern.\
    \ Consequently, we must \nguarantee patient safety in these cases by employing\
    \ medical protocols that are legitimate \nand effective. \nModel-based Development\
    \ \nPrior to building or developing a software system, we will be able to determine\
    \ how safe \nthe situation is for patients, and we will be able to establish requirements\
    \ for safe equipment \nand their connections. To ensure that the application is\
    \ safe, these standards may be \ninspected during deployment. Take note of the\
    \ way scenario analysis is carried out using \nMCPS model-based growth. Static\
    \ and dynamic vulnerability checks are the most difficult \nto understand. \n\
    Physiological close-loop \ncontrol \nMany individuals dislike employing automated\
    \ control in medical treatment for a variety of \nreasons, including regulating\
    \ an application to a specific location, doing many treatments at \nonce that\
    \ might influence a variety of bodily system in patients. It should be noted that\
    \ \nexperiences will be unique.  \nPatient Simulation and \nModelling \nPatient\
    \ modelling is essential if we are to analyse how distinct conditions and closed-loop\
    \ \ncontrols operate. It is fundamental to keep watch on elements such as clients’\
    \ respiratory \nand heart rates in closed-loop PCA circumstances, as well as how\
    \ much medication is being \nabsorbed. More basic ways are needed to assist us\
    \ in solving the difficulty of developing \nand analysing things. These techniques\
    \ have the potential to simplify certain complex \nmodels. \nAdaptive Patient\
    \ and \nsmart alarms \nThe majority of medical equipment is designed for use with\
    \ several patients (having the \nsame medical clinical conditions). In MCPS, patients\
    \ may have a wide range of reactions to \ntherapy, which may lead to confusion\
    \ and loss of time. Most medical gadgets, for example, \nwill sound an alert if\
    \ a potentially harmful situation is discovered. Medical gadgets might \npotentially\
    \ mistakenly send out false alerts. They don't have to deal with stuff like this\
    \ in \ntheir line of work. For the benefit of patients and the collection of data\
    \ for use in the \ncreation of EHR Systems, healthcare systems are now establishing\
    \ reliable network \nconnections to accomplish this goal. \nIn such situation,\
    \ we'll need algorithms that can be customised to meet the unique \nrequirements\
    \ of each patient. Using the patient's activity record in EHR, we aim to alter\
    \ \nalert settings so that there are less false alarms as well. Using \"smart\
    \ alarm services\" in \nmedical equipment in the near future will reduce the number\
    \ of false alerts. \nUser Centred Design \nIf the caregiver is overworked or anxious\
    \ or has difficulty operating a piece of equipment, \nthey may make errors in\
    \ their care. There are a number of ways that medical devices may \nbe designed\
    \ to be more user-friendly, such as providing interactive methods to learn how\
    \ to \noperate the device in the event that the user gets stuck, and providing\
    \ means for users to \nrectify errors so that they are satisfied with their gadgets.\

    Distributed MCPS that use an exclusive network communication are currently being\
    \ \ndeveloped by just one business (lessening inter-device communication's advantages,\
    \ while \nmaking regulatory clearance more straightforward). Open standards (interconnectivity)\

    \ Due to their proximity to one another, radio interference may \noccur between\
    \ medical equipment that provide various therapies to the same patient. \nTreatments\
    \ might conflict with one another if the body's response to them changes. A good\
    \ \nexample of this is \"mixed prioritisation\". The sensor's position in regard\
    \ to the patient \ndetermines the MAP measurement's accuracy. The MAP measurement\
    \ changes when the \npatient's bed, which is a Class I medical equipment, is elevated,\
    \ since it is the least \nsignificant in the FDA classification. False reports\
    \ or other undesirable behaviour might \nresult from the sensor's abrupt shift\
    \ when it is component monitoring things like vital signs. \nThis issue was utilised\
    \ to provide the monitoring system with more information. Making \nthese gadgets\
    \ while taking into account is difficult. \nPrivacy and Security \nThere are a\
    \ number of networking capabilities built into medical equipment that, when \n\
    combined, might contribute to security and privacy concerns. If a hacker gains\
    \ entry to the \nMCPS network, they might hurt or even kill individuals (by re-programming\
    \ devices). \nRehired gadgets that may be rehired through the local area network\
    \ but do not get any \nrequests from the networks might be restricted in this\
    \ way. There must be a delicate \nbalancing between freedom of travel and the\
    \ requirement for security. A strategy is needed \nfor coping with EHR system\
    \ problems. \nVerification, Validation \nand Certification \nWhen the design is\
    \ complete, verification and validation are performed. Currently, this is \nhow\
    \ things are going. By using a \"design for verification approach,\" it will be\
    \ possible to \ndemonstrate the validity of the verification process on an ever-larger\
    \ scale [10]. It is also \npossible to do verification earlier in the design process\
    \ thanks to a technology known as \nmodel-based generative approaches. Keep in\
    \ mind that run-time components may be \ncreated from medical devices. \nHigh\
    \ Assurance Software \nSome elements of medical equipment, such as hardware (such\
    \ as security locks) and other \nthings, are automated with the help of technology.\
    \ It is commonly accepted that software \ndevelopment is essential to the security\
    \ of MCPS, however this is not enough. \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH\
    \ \nThis paper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs,\
    \ security threats in CPSs, and security \nchallenges in CPSs, have been discussed.\
    \ A contemporary Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) is at its peak in terms of \nengineering,\
    \ making it intricate and multi-scale structures that are versatile. The systems\
    \ are employed in various fields in \nreal-life, and they have significantly attracted\
    \ the attention of researchers and the academia. CPSs have not become \npopular,\
    \ but there are some major segments of the fields, which are not appropriately\
    \ defined or that not sufficiently \nstudied. It necessitates more efforts to\
    \ make CPSs function in real-life. This incorporates a broader range of \ninterdisciplinary\
    \ expertise, as well as tighter integration of important enabling technologies\
    \ and a focus on environmental \nand societal concerns. It is essential for networks\
    \ to have a shared language, abstract structures, modeling techniques, and \n\
    protocols that function together in a coordinated manner. In order for abstraction\
    \ to work properly in CPS testing, \nexecution, design, and conceptualization,\
    \ all of these processes need strong methodologies and theories (also computational\
    \ \nand conceptual abstraction, i.e., that are fundamental for both computer and\
    \ human agents). Computational reasoning has \nto be employed for autonomous control\
    \ systems (for the physical system) and for discrete virtual structure (of the\
    \ physical \nsystem) in order to facilitate the writing, connecting, and building\
    \ of CPSs (with high integration levels). Different \nconcepts, e.g., time-correct\
    \ controls and operations, compositionality, synergy and goal-centric learning,\
    \ among others, \nalso require investigation in future studies.  \n \nReferences\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys

    \ State University \n2023 \n \ni \nAbstract \nAs the digital economy continues\
    \ to grow and data becomes increasingly important, \neffective data governance\
    \ is essential. A data governance framework enables the efficient \nmanagement,\
    \ sharing, and integration of data, resulting in better decision-making, \nincreased\
    \ productivity, and enhanced innovation across industries, including agriculture.\
    \ \nHowever, the agricultural sector in the United States is lagging behind other\
    \ industries in \nthe adoption of effective data governance practices. Agricultural\
    \ data governance presents \na unique set of challenges due to the wide range\
    \ of stakeholders involved and the ever-\nincreasing volume of data generated\
    \ by digital technologies in farming. One key challenge \nto achieving the benefits\
    \ of effective agricultural data governance is the lack of a robust \npolicy framework.\
    \ \nTo address this issue, this doctoral dissertation utilizes a rigorous policy\
    \ analysis \nmethodology to examine the current data governance policy frameworks,\
    \ identify gaps and \nareas for improvement, and propose a comprehensive policy\
    \ framework for agricultural \ndata governance. The proposed policy framework\
    \ is informed by the policy analysis and \ndesigned to be adaptable and scalable\
    \ to meet the changing needs of the digital economy \nand the agriculture sector.\
    \ It addresses the challenges posed by the ever-increasing volume \nof agricultural\
    \ data and aims to enhance the digital transformation of the agriculture sector.\

    \ 144 \n \n1 \nIntroduction \nIn today's digital economy, data governance plays\
    \ an increasingly vital role. A well-\ndesigned data governance framework facilitates\
    \ efficient data management, sharing, and \nintegration, leading to improved decision-making,\
    \ increased productivity, and enhanced \ninnovation across industries, including\
    \ agriculture. However, compared to other industries, \nthe agricultural sector\
    \ in the United States has been slow to adopt effective data governance \npractices.\
    \ This is due to the unique challenges presented by agricultural data governance,\
    \ \nincluding a diverse range of stakeholders and the growing volume of data generated\
    \ by \ndigital farming technologies. \nOne of the primary barriers to realizing\
    \ the benefits of effective data governance in \nagriculture is the lack of a\
    \ robust policy framework. To address this issue, this doctoral \nresearch provides\
    \ a policy analysis aimed at creating a comprehensive policy framework \nto enhance\
    \ agricultural data governance in the United States. The goal of this study is\
    \ to \nidentify opportunities to improve agricultural policies for the digital\
    \ transformation era. \nCurrently, digital technologies in farming range from\
    \ satellite-guided tractors to seed-\nselecting algorithms and crops developed\
    \ with gene-editing techniques (Bunge, 2021, p. \n3). These new technologies are\
    \ anticipated to increase productivity and drive a more \nsustainable and efficient\
    \ agriculture industry. While digital technologies are an important \ncomponent\
    \ of the agricultural sector's digital transformation, relying solely on them\
    \ is not \nsufficient for complete digitalization. \n \n2 \nEvery nozzle, pump,\
    \ valve, tank, and motor are equipped with sensors that can collect \nlarge amounts\
    \ of data as part of their regular operations (Featherstone, 2021, p. 1). For\
    \ \nexample, “…the amount of data generated per day by average farm exceeded 250\
    \ 000 data \npoints in 2015.” (Kosior, 2019a, p. 4) and an increase in agricultural\
    \ data generation is \nexpected “to exceed 2 million data points per day by 2030.”\
    \ (Kosior, 2019, p. 5). Data can \nbe combined from satellite maps, drone images,\
    \ routine soil samples, and weather and \nclimate reports. \nData generated from\
    \ all these technologies play a crucial role. Effective governance of \nthe large\
    \ amounts of agricultural data and recognizing its value, is essential to enhance\
    \ \nagriculture outcomes and maximize the sector's economic benefits. The digital\
    \ \ntransformation of agriculture involves boosting the sector's ability to not\
    \ only produce and \ngather data, but also to exchange and utilize data in new\
    \ and innovative ways. (Jouanjean \net al., 2020, p. 6). Therefore, farmers and\
    \ producers must view data as a potential strategic \nasset for their farms and\
    \ the industry as a whole.  \nIn the United States, there are various challenges\
    \ to the digital transform the agriculture \nsector, and use agricultural data\
    \ in smart agriculture1. For instance, Mr. Creighton’s corn \nfarm in Eleroy,\
    \ Illinois (Bunge, 2021, p, 1) is representative of farms that faces challenges\
    \ \ndue to the rise of digital technologies and the vast amount of data they collect.\
    \ As reported \nin the Wall Street Journal on August 22, 2021, one of the significant\
    \ difficulties that U.S. \n \n1 “The digitalization of agriculture involves the\
    \ development, adoption, and iteration of digital \ntechnologies in the agricultural\
    \ sector; what has been referred to as both digital agriculture (preferred in\
    \ \nAustralia and New Zealand) or smart farming (preferred in the European Union)\
    \ in different spatial \ncontexts.” (Fielke et al. 2020, p.3) \n \n3 \nfarms currently\
    \ face is working with agricultural technology providers (ATPs)2 to govern \n\
    data. \nIn this case, Mr. Creighton signed a contract with provider Indigo Agriculture\
    \ Inc. \nIndigo’s original concept was to “reshape the agriculture industry” (Bunge,\
    \ 2021, p.2) \nusing cutting-edge technology and a data platform to connect farmers\
    \ with buyers and get \nthe best prices in the market. They also marketed special\
    \ microbes to enhance seed \nproductivity, and farmers had the option to sell\
    \ their products at guaranteed premium prices \nthrough their program. Indigo’s\
    \ business strategy was to create a cluster of digital \nagricultural data platforms,\
    \ from seeds, to an online marketplace, and transport logistics. \nHowever, Mr.\
    \ Creighton faced difficulties, such as a large amount of paperwork, short \n\
    response times to his requests and concerns, and payment delays. This led to growing\
    \ \nmistrust of Indigo Inc. by Mr. Creighton.  \nSimilar to Mr. Creighton, many\
    \ farmers in the U.S. are encountering challenges with \nATPs entering the business\
    \ market and focusing on collecting agricultural data. One such \ncompany is Agrian\
    \ Inc., based in California. Agrian Inc. provides farmers with the tools to \n\
    comply with federal and state pesticide and chemical regulations and offers platforms\
    \ for \nharvest, application, and planting maps. Growers utilize these services\
    \ to create fertility \nrecommendations or to aggregate data to address agronomic\
    \ needs based on the maps. \n(Featherstone, 2021, p. 1) However, the ability to\
    \ aggregate agricultural data has raised \n \n2 Agricultural Technology Providers\
    \ (ATPs) could be categorized into nine main categories: farm \nmanagement software,\
    \ precision agriculture and predictive data analytics, sensors, animal data, robotics\
    \ \nand drones, smart irrigation, next gen farms, marketplaces, plant data/analysis.\

    \ \n \n4 \nconcerns among farmers about data ownership, privacy and security as\
    \ well as the flows \nof data sharing. \nAnother challenge faced by U.S. farmers\
    \ is the lack of accessible digital tools for \nrepairing digital farming equipment.\
    \ As noted at a small cattle farm in Cape Girardeau, \nMissouri, (O’Reilly, 2021),\
    \ the farmer, Mr. Hovis struggled to find software tools needed \nto sync a new\
    \ part to his tractor. The cost of acquiring the necessary technology for repairs\
    \ \nwas just as high as the farm itself. To address this issue, Mr. Hovis filed\
    \ a right-to-repair \nbill in January 2021, and many other farmers across the\
    \ United States are also pushing for \n“right to repair” laws that would require\
    \ manufacturers to provide easy access to tools, \nsoftware parts, and documentation.\
    \ This effort is gaining support from state farm bureaus, \nfarmers unions3, and\
    \ lawmakers from both parties in states like Florida, Montana, and \nNebraska\
    \ (O’Reilly, 2021). \nThe challenges faced by farmers like Mr. Creighton and Mr.\
    \ Hovis, highlight the \ndifficulties that U.S. farmers encounter with technology\
    \ and data in the modern agriculture \nindustry. Despite the benefits of technology\
    \ and data in improving farming efficiency, \ngoverning agricultural data remains\
    \ a critical issue that needs to be addressed. The situation \nof Mr. Creighton\
    \ with ATPs and Mr. Hovis with software tools demonstrate the need for \n \n3\
    \ On January 2023, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and John Deere signed\
    \ a \nmemorandum of understanding that guarantees farmers' right to repair their\
    \ own farm equipment (AFBF, \n2023). This agreement was the result of years of\
    \ discussions between the two organizations. The MOU \noutlines a plan to address\
    \ farmers' concerns and John Deere promises to work with farmers and dealers to\
    \ \nresolve any issues that arise, while also committing to bi-annual evaluations\
    \ with the AFBF. The MOU \ngrants farmers access to repair codes, manuals, product\
    \ guides, and the ability to purchase diagnostic tools \ndirectly from John Deere.\
    \ The manufacturer also offers assistance with ordering parts and products. This\
    \ \nagreement could serve as a blueprint for other manufacturers, and AFBF has\
    \ already initiated talks for the \nsame. However, the John Deere - AFBF MOU is\
    \ a non-binding agreement between one equipment \nmanufacturer and one group representing\
    \ farmers in the U.S. (National Farmers Union, 2023). \n \n5 \nfarmers to have\
    \ more control over the technology they use and access to necessary \ninformation\
    \ to repair their equipment. This reflects the ongoing tensions in the agriculture\
    \ \nindustry between the benefits of technology and the challenges of data governance\
    \ and \nmaintenance. \nFigure 1 highlights the history of innovation in the agricultural\
    \ sector and showcases \nthe challenges faced by U.S. farms in adapting to the\
    \ changing methods and technologies \nduring the process of digital transformation.\

    \ ways to make farming more efficient, sustainable, \nand profitable (OECD, 2019a,\
    \ p. 21). The incorporation of digital technologies and data \ncollection in the\
    \ form of smart agriculture allows the sector to advance these efforts and \n\
    overcome some of the challenges faced by farmers and producers. By embracing digital\
    \ \ntransformation, the industry can use data to make better decisions, increase\
    \ productivity, \nreduce waste, and reduce negative environmental impacts. The\
    \ key is to ensure that the \ndata generated is effectively managed and that farmers\
    \ and producers can access and use it \nin ways that benefit both themselves and\
    \ the larger sector. \nThe FAO's Status Report on Digital Technologies in Agriculture\
    \ and Rural Areas states \nthat the growth of the market will be driven by the\
    \ gradual integration of advanced and \ninterconnected digital solutions, along\
    \ with the rise of big data analytics (Trendov, et al. \n2019, p.80). This highlights\
    \ the fact that the implementation of smart or digital agriculture \nnot only\
    \ requires a significant investment in digital tools and technology but also a\
    \ shift in \nthinking5 to address the new challenges brought about by data and\
    \ its usage. \nAdditionally, farmers are concerned about data ownership, privacy,\
    \ and security, which \nhighlights the need for clear and concise policies on\
    \ data sharing and use in the agricultural \nsector. This is especially important\
    \ in the context of the U.S., where there is a growing \nmarket of ATPs that aim\
    \ to aggregate and use farm data. Farmers need to understand the \n \n5 The shift\
    \ to digital agriculture requires not just the use of new technology such as drones,\
    \ sensors, or \nmobile apps, but also an increase in farmers' data literacy. Farmers\
    \ must learn to manage and govern their \ndata to fully realize its potential\
    \ benefits, including reducing risk and improving production efficiency. \nThey\
    \ must go beyond simply following technology recommendations and understand how\
    \ the data \ncollected can benefit their farming practices and the entire agricultural\
    \ value chain. This shift involves a \nchange in traditional farming methods and\
    \ requires an investment in learning and understanding data and \nits use in agriculture.\
    \ \n \n7 \nflow of data and be confident that their data will not be misused or\
    \ exploited. A well-\ndesigned policy framework will help to mitigate these concerns\
    \ and ensure that the benefits \nof smart agriculture and digital technologies\
    \ are effectively leveraged for the benefit of \nfarmers and the overall agricultural\
    \ sector. \n \n \n8 \nChapter 1: Research Question and Methods  \nThe aim of this\
    \ chapter is to identify the existing gaps in research and to investigate the\
    \ \nrole that a policy framework could play in enhancing the digitalization process\
    \ of \nagriculture in the United States. The focus is on how a well-designed policy\
    \ framework \ncould contribute to the sustainable development of modernized farming\
    \ practices through \nthe use of digital technologies. The primary research question\
    \ addressed in this study is:  \nWhat is the most effective policy framework for\
    \ governing agricultural \ndata to promote sustainable farm modernization through\
    \ digital \ntransformation? \nIn this context, the term \"sustainability\" refers\
    \ to not only the economic sustainability \nof farms (i.e., their ability to remain\
    \ profitable and sustainable operations), but also the \nenvironmental and social\
    \ sustainability of the agricultural sector as a whole. Although these \nvarious\
    \ aspects of sustainability require different types of agricultural data, this\
    \ research \nproject assumes that high-quality data is required for each aspect's\
    \ policy-making and \nsocial action. Because this project addresses the primary\
    \ question of how to establish a data \ngovernance system, the question of how\
    \ data can be applied to different aspects of \nsustainability is left to future\
    \ research. Sustainability represents the long-term impact that \nagricultural\
    \ data governance aims to achieve. However, this research focuses on the \npreceding\
    \ outputs of interest, which are the production and sharing of high-quality data\
    \ \nand the subsequent outcome of interest, which is the cost-effective digitization\
    \ of the \nagricultural sector. \nThe primary research focus of this study is\
    \ to examine the general issues related to data \npractices and contractual complexities\
    \ in the agriculture sector at the national level in the \n \n9 \nUnited States.\
    \ The study also looks at cross-sector data governance practices and compares\
    \ \nthem with international approaches. Additionally, the research addresses the\
    \ sub-question \nof what type of policy framework can effectively balance the\
    \ interests of various \nstakeholders while addressing the benefits and risks\
    \ of increased data access in the U.S. \nagricultural sector. \nResearch Gap \n\
    In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the amount of data generated\
    \ \nby agricultural activities in the United States. According to a report by\
    \ the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), the amount of data generated\
    \ by precision agriculture \ntechnologies in the country is expected to grow by\
    \ 20% per year, reaching a total of 4.1 \nmillion terabytes by 2050 (USDA, 2019).\
    \ This represents a massive opportunity for the \nagriculture sector to improve\
    \ its efficiency, productivity, and sustainability, as well as to \ncreate new\
    \ business models and revenue streams. However, to fully realize the potential\
    \ of \nthis data, it is necessary to establish a governance framework that promotes\
    \ data sharing, \nprotects data privacy and security, and addresses the technical\
    \ and legal challenges \nassociated with the use of agricultural data.  \nThis\
    \ study recognizes that there is a lack of consensus in the U.S. regarding the\
    \ \nmechanisms that can ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the flow\
    \ of agricultural \ndata. Currently, there are no legally binding frameworks in\
    \ place to govern the use and \nmanagement of agricultural data, leading to a\
    \ need for a comprehensive policy framework \nto address these issues.  \n \n\
    10 \nResearchers such as Sanderson et al. (2018) and Wiseman (2019) have explored\
    \ the use \nof codes of practice (COPs) as a means of addressing the legislative\
    \ gaps in the regulation \nof agricultural data practices (Sanderson et al., 2018)\
    \ in the U.S. and other countries where \nthey are considered enforceable. However,\
    \ despite the efforts of COPs to promote \nresponsible data practices in the agriculture\
    \ sector, there is a lack of evaluation of \ncompliance with the core principles\
    \ of these codes, which presents a significant challenge. \nNot all agriculture\
    \ service and technology providers, as well as farmers and producers, \nparticipate\
    \ in the collective efforts to implement the codes of agricultural data practices.\
    \ \nAs a result, it is unclear whether these codes have been successful in promoting\
    \ accountable \ndata practices and trust between technology providers, farmers,\
    \ and producers. The \nparticipation rate in these codes and its impact on the\
    \ trust relationships between \nstakeholders is not well understood.  \nAdditionally,\
    \ the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is in the process of \nupdating\
    \ its agricultural data infrastructure systems (Ristino & Hart, 2022). Discussions\
    \ \nare ongoing about the need for the USDA and its agencies to undergo institutional\
    \ changes \nto support the digital transformation of agriculture. Implementing\
    \ such changes would \nrequire a comprehensive understanding of data sharing,\
    \ use, and reuse at a macro-level, \nand would necessitate collaboration from\
    \ all stakeholders involved. \nThe situation presented above highlights the potential\
    \ risks and benefits of policy \ndecisions that could impact the digital transformation\
    \ of the agriculture sector, and the lack \nof comprehensive analysis or proposals\
    \ for a data governance framework specific to this \nsector. While COPs have been\
    \ explored as a means of promoting responsible data practices \n \n11 \nin agriculture,\
    \ the lack of evaluation of compliance and participation rates of stakeholders\
    \ \npose significant challenges. \nAs there is limited literature available on\
    \ a public policy, legal, or regulatory framework \nfor governing agricultural\
    \ data practices, particularly in the United States, this research \naims to fill\
    \ this gap in the literature and in the fields of policy analysis and public policy.\
    \ \nThe goal is to facilitate meaningful changes that encourage and support efficient,\
    \ secure, \nand accurate data sharing across stakeholders in the agriculture sector.\
    \  \nThis research aims to provide a comprehensive policy framework for governing\
    \ \nagricultural data practices by conducting a policy analysis and proposing\
    \ policy \nalternatives that have the potential to significantly improve agricultural\
    \ data practices. The \nfocus is on establishing standards for data usage at the\
    \ macro, meso, and micro levels to \nencourage efficient, secure, and accurate\
    \ data sharing among agriculture sector \nstakeholders. \nA comprehensive policy\
    \ framework for governing agricultural data practices could lead \nto improved\
    \ efficiency, reduced costs and a lower environmental impact in the agriculture\
    \ \nsector. It can serve as a valuable resource for policymakers and stakeholders\
    \ in considering \noptions for improving the governance of agricultural data.\
    \ However, it is important to note \nthat the implementation of a prescriptive\
    \ policy framework (Sanderson et al., 2018, p. 7) \nmay face challenges such high\
    \ costs, and difficulty in reaching agreement among all \ninterested stakeholders,\
    \ including government agencies, agriculture service and technology \nproviders,\
    \ farmers, and producers. Despite these limitations, this research aims to \n\
    contribute to the sector and to public affairs by offering a valuable policy framework\
    \ for \n \n12 \ngoverning agricultural data practices that would be acceptable\
    \ and implementable by all \ninterested parties in the agriculture sector.  \n\
    The complexity of the task is compounded by the need to balance the competing\
    \ \nconcerns of different stakeholders and address the benefits and risks of enhanced\
    \ access to \ndata. The challenge of reaching agreement and implementing a comprehensive\
    \ policy \nframework highlights the need for a collaborative and inclusive process\
    \ that takes into \naccount the perspectives and interests of all stakeholders.\
    \  \nOntology \nAdopting a structuralist analysis approach to govern agricultural\
    \ data means \nacknowledging the power structures that shape incentives and constraints\
    \ for different \nactors within the agricultural sector. This involves recognizing\
    \ that the role of structures \n“[is to] exercise causal powers by providing an\
    \ environment of incentives and prohibitions \nfor various agents within a social\
    \ system.” (Little, 1991, p. 104). This approach seeks to \nensure that the control,\
    \ access, sharing, and use of agricultural data by all stakeholders \nleads to\
    \ a fair and equitable outcome. By examining the various elements and components\
    \ \nof the agricultural data governance process, the goal is to promote a system\
    \ that is \nbeneficial to all parties involved. \nAs stated by Little (1991, p.\
    \ 105) the “incentives and constraints imposed by the social \nstructure will\
    \ have predictable consequences for the choices that individuals will make.” It\
    \ \nis therefore necessary for the state and its institutions to step in and implement\
    \ trustworthy \nsystems to govern agricultural data in the U.S. \n \n13 \nFigure\
    \ 2 illustrates Coleman's Boat (Coleman, 1986, p.1310) and provides a visual \n\
    representation of the relationship between macro and micro foundational connections.\
    \ It \nserves as a structural explanation and provides insight into the intention\
    \ driving this \nresearch6.  \nFigure 2 The Explanatory Cycle \n \nDiagram elaborated\
    \ by the author \nThe social system of agricultural data governance (Ag-DG) is\
    \ institutionalized as a \npolicy framework, with norms for sector participation\
    \ playing a crucial role at the meso \nlevel. Individual decisions to participate\
    \ and share data within the framework are driven by \ntrust, transparency, and\
    \ legitimacy. This leads to a more stable and effective agricultural \nsector,\
    \ resulting in improved products and services. \n \n6 In this research, the epistemological\
    \ approach adopts inductive reasoning to create knowledge by \nobserving, from\
    \ a comparative perspective, particular case studies. Creating knowledge by induction\
    \ might \nbe open-ended and the appearance of new evidence can modify the initial\
    \ conclusion. However, this could \nbe also positive since it gives the possibility\
    \ to feedback policy frameworks to adapt and incorporate \nchanges and new knowledge.\
    \ \n \n14 \nPolicy Science versus Social Science \nPolicy science, as elucidated\
    \ by Goodin et al. (2006), endeavors to supply policy actors \nwith useful information\
    \ for the purpose of providing policy advice. The objective of policy \nstudies\
    \ is action-oriented and aimed at contributing to the improvement of life by offering\
    \ \npolitical actors something that they can put into use (Goodin et al. 2006,\
    \ p. 5). Policy \nscience seeks to address questions regarding what ought to be\
    \ done, as opposed to what it \nis. On the other hand, social science seeks to\
    \ uncover laws and generalizations and provides \npolitical-institutional designs\
    \ as instruments of collective values (Goodin et al. 2006). In \ncontrast, policy\
    \ science focuses on what can be achieved collectively through and within \ninstitutional\
    \ frameworks. \nIn this research, the findings of policy analysis are not intended\
    \ to be general statements \nabout the theme under research, but specific prescriptions\
    \ intended to assist policymakers. \nTherefore, the policy science approach does\
    \ not take a deductive approach but rather an \ninductive one. Policy studies\
    \ stress an aspiration toward relevance7 along with the role of \nvalue premises8\
    \ in policy choice (Goodin et al. 2006)9. This research design does not \n \n\
    7 Policy studies is a multidisciplinary field that investigates the decision-making\
    \ processes involved in \npublic policy. In this context, \"relevance\" refers\
    \ to the importance of ensuring that policy decisions are \nbased on evidence\
    \ and are responsive to the needs and values of society. The idea is that policies\
    \ should be \ngrounded in the best available knowledge and research, and should\
    \ be tailored to the specific needs of the \npeople and communities affected by\
    \ them. \n8 Value premises, on the other hand, refer to the underlying moral and\
    \ ethical principles that shape policy \ndecisions. These may include ideas about\
    \ social justice, individual rights, environmental sustainability, and \nother\
    \ ethical considerations that are important to policymakers and society as a whole.\
    \ \n9 Goodin et al. (2006) argue that policy studies should take both relevance\
    \ and value premises into \naccount when analyzing policy choices. By doing so,\
    \ policymakers can make more informed decisions that \nare grounded in evidence\
    \ and aligned with the values and priorities of society. This approach recognizes\
    \ \nthat policy choices are not purely technical or objective, but are influenced\
    \ by a range of social, cultural, \nand political factors, and by the values and\
    \ beliefs of the people involved in making those choices. \n \n15 \naddress the\
    \ general question of what kind of policy framework will tend to cause \nimprovements\
    \ in agricultural data governance and thus of agricultural outcomes but only \n\
    the context-specific question of what kind of policy framework should be implemented\
    \ as \noptimal for agricultural data governance in the United States. \nIn addition,\
    \ this research seeks to gain an understanding of not only farmers' \nperspectives\
    \ on the value and use of agricultural data, but also the perspectives of other\
    \ \nstakeholders involved in the sector. The objective of conducting policy analysis\
    \ is to assist \ndecision-makers in determining the desired outcomes and the most\
    \ feasible means of \nachieving those goals (Schneider, 1997, p. 9) through the\
    \ implementation of public policy. \nPolicy plays a mediating role in resolving\
    \ conflicts and fostering compromise among \nconflicting interests. It endeavors\
    \ to establish an optimal structure that would provide \nsuitable incentives to\
    \ stakeholders, thus overcoming challenges such as mistrust, lack of \ntransparency,\
    \ and information asymmetry risks.  \nThis study specifically examines the relationship\
    \ between stakeholders such as farmers, \nas data primary contributors, and third-party\
    \ agriculture technology providers, with a focus \non resolving the conflicts\
    \ arising from agricultural data usage. The aim is to create a \nstructure that\
    \ facilitates collaboration and establishes a long-lasting and trustworthy \n\
    relationship between farmers, producers, tech and service providers.  \nResearch\
    \ Design and Methods \nAs stated by Dunn (2018, p. 3), policy analysis is a comprehensive\
    \ and interdisciplinary \nprocess aimed at the production, critical evaluation,\
    \ and dissemination of policy-relevant \nknowledge. The methods of policy analysis\
    \ are designed to address the intricate nature of \n \n16 \nthe policy-making\
    \ process. This study proposes a multi-method strategy (Peters & \nFontaine, 2020,\
    \ p. 14) that aims to understand the problem at hand through the examination \n\
    of tangible and verifiable facts and information. \nThis research utilizes policy\
    \ analysis methods to structure the problem, design policy \noptions, and forecast\
    \ policy proposals. These methods are considered as tools for creating \nand transforming\
    \ knowledge (Dunn, 2018, p. 8). Table 1 presents an overview of the policy \n\
    analysis methods selected for this research. \nTable 1 Methods of Policy Analysis\

    \ and best practices. This chapter discusses the different approaches \ntaken\
    \ in the U.S. and other countries to solve the agricultural data governance problem.\
    \ \nThese existing data governance policies serve as the basis for developing\
    \ three policy \nalternatives. This step includes consolidating the gathered information\
    \ to provide a \ncomprehensive analysis and designing policy options to solve\
    \ the agricultural data \ngovernance problem in the U.S. \nChapter 4: Policy Proposal:\
    \ In this chapter, this research then proceeds to project the \nfeasibility and\
    \ effectiveness of these three policy options in the context of the U.S., and\

    \ The chapter \nthen evaluates the policy options using criteria such as cost-effectiveness,\

    \ policy option.  \nIn conclusion, policy analysis methods serve as effective\
    \ means of evaluating and \nproposing \"potential solutions to practical problems\"\
    \ (Dunn, 2018, p. 3), including those \nrelated to agricultural data governance.\
    \ These methods aid in accurately defining the policy \nproblem. This research\
    \ draws on a comparative policy lesson-drawing approach to identify \nviable options\
    \ for designing the three most appropriate policy alternatives. The evidence \n\
    from comparative cases is used to project the feasibility and effectiveness of\
    \ each model \nin the U.S. context while balancing the competing demands of various\
    \ stakeholders. \n \n19 \nChapter 2: The Policy Problem \nThis chapter will address\
    \ the nature and scope of the agricultural data governance policy \nproblem. It\
    \ will build on the previous chapter by presenting a detailed and well-structured\
    \ \nmodel of the policy problem. To achieve this, this research uses three methods\
    \ of problem \nstructuring. The chapter concludes with a preferred model of the\
    \ policy problem. This \nmodel will serve as the basis for formulating policy\
    \ options in Chapter 3. This chapter also \nincludes the description of the context\
    \ covering agricultural data and the data governance \nframework, which serves\
    \ as background information to structure the problem in the \nagriculture sector\
    \ in the U.S. \nAgricultural Data and Data Governance \n▪ \nAgricultural Data\
    \ \nData can be understood as a representation of factual information in various\
    \ formats, \nincluding numerical, textual, visual, or audio forms (Abraham et\
    \ al. 2019). On many \noccasions, data has been described as a valuable commodity,\
    \ similar to oil, that can \ncontribute to economic growth and development (Benfeldt\
    \ Nielsen, 2017, p. 120). Unlike \noil, however, data is a renewable resource\
    \ that can be continuously used and leveraged for \nmultiple purposes.  \nTo realize\
    \ the full potential of data, it is crucial to understand the contextual information\
    \ \nthat provides value to the data. According to DAMA-DMBOK (2015), context refers\
    \ to \nthe data's representational system. For instance, in the agricultural sector,\
    \ data has the \npotential to drive better decision making, increase farm profitability,\
    \ and promote \n \n20 \nsustainability by aggregating and analyzing various data\
    \ sources, such as seed yields, input \nrates, and product pricing (Séronie, 2020).\
    \ \nAgricultural data classification encompasses a wide range of categories, including\
    \ \nlivestock data, land data, agronomic data, climate data, and equipment data,\
    \ among others. \nIn some cases, this type of data may be linked to personal information\
    \ about farmers. Land \ndata, for example, may include information such as the\
    \ farmer's name, address, and \nfinancial information such as bank loans (Wiseman\
    \ & Sanderson, 2019). It is critical to \ndistinguish between data streams in\
    \ the agri-food chain10, depending on whether they are \nrelated to pre-planting\
    \ or consumption activities. \nOne of the difficulties in determining the origin\
    \ of agricultural data is determining \nwhether it is generated on-farm or off-farm,\
    \ especially when it is generated on-farm \nthrough a third party, such as an\
    \ agriculture technology provider (ATP). This lack of clear \ndistinction may\
    \ lead to confusion regarding the ownership and control of this type of data.\
    \ \nThe classification criteria for agricultural data also include how and why\
    \ the data is \ngenerated (Jouanjean et al., 2020). In this regard, Jouanjean\
    \ et al. (2020) classified how \nagricultural data is generated into three categories:\
    \ process-mediated, machine-generated, \nand human-sourced. Traditional business\
    \ data generated as a result of processes that \nmonitor and record business events\
    \ of interest falls under the purview of process-mediated \n \n10 This distinction\
    \ is important because different types of data may require different levels of\
    \ protection or \nregulation. For example, data related to pre-planting activities,\
    \ such as land data, may be more sensitive \nand require more protection because\
    \ they can be linked to personal information about farmers. On the other \nhand,\
    \ data related to consumption activities, such as nutritional information, may\
    \ require more transparency \nand regulation to ensure food safety and consumer\
    \ protection. Therefore, understanding the different types \nof data in the agri-food\
    \ chain and their associated risks and benefits is crucial for developing effective\
    \ \npolicies and regulations for agricultural data governance. \n \n21 \ndata\
    \ (Jouanjean et al. 2020). Machine-generated data, on the other hand, is generated\
    \ \nautomatically by computer-based digital devices, tools, and applications that\
    \ have grown \nin importance with the rise of precision farming11. Finally, human-sourced\
    \ data refers to \nhuman-created records, such as those found in books, photographs,\
    \ audio, and video \n(Jouanjean et al. 2020). \nThe second criterion for classifying\
    \ agricultural data is based on its primary reason why \n(purpose), which is to\
    \ assist farmers in making informed decisions. For instance, \nagriculture data\
    \ is used by the private sector to develop and support new services and \nactivities,\
    \ while agricultural data is used by public institutions to inform their innovation\
    \ \npolicies and activities (Jouanjean et al. 2020). \nIn the agriculture sector\
    \ of the U.S., data is used in two contexts: public and private big \ndata. On\
    \ the one hand, public-level big data, according to Stubbs (2016), refers to records\
    \ \ncollected, maintained, and analyzed through publicly funded sources and federal\
    \ agencies, \nsuch as farm program participant records and weather data. Private\
    \ big data, on the other \nhand, includes records generated at the production\
    \ level by farmers and agriculture \ntechnology providers, such as yield data,\
    \ soil analysis, irrigation levels, livestock \nmovement, and grazing rates. Both\
    \ public and private big data are useful in agriculture. \nThey provide a more\
    \ accurate picture of agricultural operations, making them a better \ndecision-making\
    \ tool. \n \n11 The increased in data generation that could provide insights for\
    \ making informed-farming decisions, \nneed specialized regulation considerations.\
    \ \n \n22 \nThis study uses the agricultural data taxonomy proposed by Jouanjean\
    \ et al. (2020), \nwhich focuses on what data is generated and how it is collected.\
    \ Jouanjean et al. (2020) \nclassify and categorize agricultural data, dividing\
    \ it into three broad typologies: farm \nbusiness operations and management data,\
    \ farm production process tracking data, and data \ncollected to provide general\
    \ agricultural services. \nThis research incorporates Stubbs' (2016) distinction\
    \ between private and public data, \nwhich relates to the why of data generation.\
    \ This analysis identifies key agricultural data \nthat farmers and other stakeholders\
    \ should be aware of. Table 2 summarizes the various \ntypes of agricultural data,\

    \ documents that establish not only data quality standards \nbut also privacy\
    \ protection requirements. When collecting data, the USDA and its affiliated \n\
    agencies generally prioritize confidentiality, transparency, and public access.\
    \ However, as \nStubbs (2016, p. 5) points out, one of the major challenges for\
    \ public agricultural big data \nis a constrained federal budget, reduced staffing\
    \ levels, and a lag in the adoption of new \ntechnologies. These factors have\
    \ all had an impact on federal agriculture agencies’ ability \nto collect, govern\
    \ and manage data effectively. \nThe collection, sharing, and use of agricultural\
    \ data present various challenges for the \nUSDA, as noted by Ristino and Hart\
    \ (2022, p. 3). These challenges include the absence of \nopen data standards,\
    \ inconsistent system interoperability, misaligned incentives for farmers \nto\
    \ provide data, leadership and governance gaps, and inconsistent legal authority\
    \ and \n \n27 \ninterpretation within the agency. Figure 5 depicts the various\
    \ USDA agencies12 that require \nfarmers to report their data in order to participate\
    \ in programs like soil conservation. \nHowever, the current reporting requirements\
    \ impose a burden on farmers, as they are \nrequired to report their data to multiple\
    \ USDA agencies (Sanderson et al., 2018), and this \nissue has yet to be resolved.\

    \ \n \n29 \nreduced farming risks, are just a few examples. There are also environmental\
    \ benefits \nassociated with this, including improved soil quality and more efficient\
    \ use of water \nresources. The ability to collect, process, and analyze agricultural\
    \ data in real time provides \nadditional benefits as well as new business opportunities.\
    \ \nAccording to Stubbs (2016), the use of these advanced technologies has created\
    \ an ever-\nchanging landscape of information sources and stakeholders. However,\
    \ the complexity of \nthe data collection process, as well as the involvement\
    \ of numerous private players, pose \nsignificant challenges in the private agricultural\
    \ data sector.  \nData standardization, interoperability, accuracy, and privacy\
    \ concerns are just a few of \nthe key challenges. According to Stubbs (2016,\
    \ p. 11), one of the most pressing challenges \nconfronting the private agricultural\
    \ data sector is data privacy, and producers must ensure \nthat their data is\
    \ secure and protected from unauthorized access. Furthermore, data \nstandardization\
    \ is an important issue because it ensures that the data gathered can be \naccurately\
    \ compared and analyzed across multiple sources and stakeholders. \nThe network\
    \ that facilitates communication among the technologies involved is another \n\
    critical aspect of data collection. This network is commonly referred to as the\
    \ \"Internet of \nThings\" (IoT), which refers to a network of interconnected\
    \ objects that communicate with \none another and with computers via the Internet\
    \ (Stubbs, 2016, p.8). This area is subject to \ncontinuous development and evolution\
    \ due to the dynamic nature of the technologies \ninvolved in the data collection\
    \ stage. \nFurthermore, the use of cloud computing to store and process data has\
    \ grown in \npopularity because it provides a cost-effective solution for data\
    \ storage and management \n \n30 \n(Stubbs (2016, p. 8). With the rise of cloud\
    \ computing, producers have gained greater \ncontrol over their data collection,\
    \ management, and analysis. They can also share their data \nwith other farmers\
    \ and agricultural industry stakeholders. However, this presents \nchallenges,\
    \ such as ensuring data security, privacy, and data ownership. The rapidly \n\
    changing landscape of the data collection stage in private agriculture big data\
    \ highlights \nthe importance of a comprehensive and adaptable policy framework\
    \ that ensures \nresponsible data collection and use in the agriculture sector.\

    \ \nImportant stakeholders \nTechnologies for Data Collection  \nEquipment \n\
    Manufacturers \nManufacturers of traditional farm equipment (e.g., \ntractors)\
    \ are well positioned to expand into data \ncollection technologies. In many cases,\
    \ technology is an \nextension of the equipment already in use. \nChemical Companies\
    \ and \nApplicators \nChemical companies are playing an increasing role in the\
    \ \nresearch and development of data collection tools and \nmethods to improve\
    \ application use of nutrients and \npesticides. \nMulti-Use Technologies \nTechnologies\
    \ used by other industries. For example, \nsome farmers in the dairy industry\
    \ are exploring the use \nof radio frequency identification (RFID), commonly \n\
    used in the shipping and transportation industries, to \ntrack movement, production,\
    \ feed, and disease outbreaks \nin herds.  \nAdapted from Stubbs (2016, p.8) \n\
    \ \n31 \nPrivate agricultural big data management encompasses the processes of\
    \ organizing, \nadministering, and governing large amounts of data (Stubbs, 2016,\
    \ p. 9). The goal of data \nmanagement is to ensure high-quality data that is\
    \ easily accessible to end users. This stage \nof the agriculture industry is\
    \ rapidly growing, with an increasing number of actors \nproviding flexible solutions\
    \ for mid-sized and small-scale farmers/producers. These actors \neither collect\
    \ and organize data for a fee or serve as data brokers, trading and selling data\
    \ \n(Stubbs, 2016, p. 9). Table 6 summarizes some of the most common data management\
    \ \npractices and providers. \nTable 6 Data Practices and Providers \nImportant\
    \ stakeholders \nData management practices \nProducers \nProducers are the primary\
    \ data generators in the \nagricultural sector. They have traditionally stored\
    \ their \ndata locally, either on their own computers or on physical \ndata storage\
    \ devices. However, some are now beginning \nto explore cloud-based storage options\
    \ that offer greater \nconvenience and accessibility. Producers are also \nincreasingly\
    \ interested in data analytics and using data to \nimprove their farming practices.\
    \ \nData Collectors \nData collection and management companies offer a \nvariety\
    \ of services to producers, including data collection, \nstorage, and analysis.\
    \ Many of these companies are \naffiliated with other agricultural products such\
    \ as \nequipment, seed, or chemicals. Data collectors often \nprovide value-added\
    \ services such as benchmarking and \npredictive analytics. \n \n32 \nIndependent\
    \ \nAgricultural Data Banks \nThese are private companies that specialize in data\
    \ \nmanagement and analysis for the agricultural sector. They \noffer a range\
    \ of services, including data storage, analysis, \nand reporting. Data banks generally\
    \ operate on a \nsubscription or fee-for-service basis, and their clients \ninclude\
    \ both producers and other agricultural \nstakeholders. \nData Cooperatives \n\
    These are producer-owned organizations that pool \nmembers’ data to create economies\
    \ of scale and generate \nadditional value and negotiating power. Data cooperatives\
    \ \noffer a variety of services, including data storage, \nmanagement, and analysis.\
    \ They also provide members \nwith access to benchmarking data and other industry\
    \ \ninsights. Many data cooperatives anonymize data before \nselling it to interested\
    \ parties in order to protect members’ \nprivacy. \nAdapted from Stubbs (2016,\
    \ p.9) \nThe final stage of the process is the use of private agricultural data.\
    \ In this stage, the \nvalue of the data for producers is realized. Typically,\
    \ data sets are analyzed and packaged \nin a usable and understandable format.\
    \ Stubbs (2016, p.10) distinguishes three types of \nanalytical products: descriptive,\
    \ prescriptive, and predictive data products. Table 7 lists the \nprimary users\
    \ of these data products. \nTable 7 Users of Agricultural Data \nImportant stakeholders\
    \ \nUses/users of private ag data \nFarmers and Ranchers \nProducers who own the\
    \ data can benefit from big data \nproducts that offer improved production such\
    \ as lower \ncosts, increased yields, or reduced inputs. \n \n33 \nRetailers \n\
    Retailers create big data products by analyzing data, \npackaging it into a usable\
    \ and timely product, and selling \nit to the producer. \nIndustry Groups \nNational\
    \ commodity and agricultural industry groups \nprovide guidance on licensing language\
    \ and data \ncontracts, especially related to producer concerns \nregarding privacy,\
    \ security, and ownership. \nEnvironmental Interests \nThe use of private agricultural\
    \ big data can result in \npositive environmental effects such as reduced inputs\
    \ \n(e.g., fertilizer, pesticides, and water) and increased \nefficiencies (e.g.,\
    \ reduced air emissions through reduced \ntillage overlap). \nAdapted from Stubbs\
    \ (2016, p.10) \nConsequently, private corporations are leveraging the use of\
    \ meteorological, soil, and \nfield-based information to assist farmers in determining\
    \ crop yield-limiting conditions and \nmaking production-related decisions. Furthermore,\
    \ certain entities are using cutting-edge \nmicrobiology and technology to improve\
    \ crop robustness and accelerate the growth of \ncarbon markets (Ristino & Hart,\
    \ 2022). Moreover, agricultural machinery manufacturers \nhave embraced new technologies\
    \ and integrated the most recent tractors and harvesters into \ncloud systems,\
    \ allowing for the collection of real-time data from the field for future use.\
    \ \nHowever, it has been noted that the USDA's efforts to collect, integrate,\
    \ and use data to \nimprove farmer outcomes and agricultural program performance\
    \ have been hampered \n \n34 \n(Ristino & Hart, 2022), and that much of the large\
    \ amounts of data collected to address \nvarious agriculture-related missions\
    \ remains unused15 (Ristino & Hart, 2022). \nTo summarize, the use of private\
    \ agricultural data is becoming more common, and the \nbenefits are becoming more\
    \ apparent. Private agricultural data has the potential to \nrevolutionize the\
    \ way farmers make production decisions, from increased yields and lower \ncosts\
    \ to improved soil quality and water availability. However, challenges remain,\
    \ such as \ndata ownership and privacy concerns, high costs of precision tools\
    \ and equipment, and \nmarket competition. Despite these obstacles, private companies\
    \ are using cutting-edge \ntechnologies such as IoT, drones, and sensors to collect,\
    \ manage, and analyze data in order \nto provide solutions to farmers. Furthermore,\
    \ while the USDA's data collection efforts have \nbeen limited, private companies\
    \ are stepping up to fill the void, providing innovative \nsolutions that can\
    \ improve farmer outcomes and performance. Figure 7 shows the \ndistribution of\
    \ agricultural data in the United States and highlights the key players \ninvolved.\
    \ The figure illustrates the absence of governance data infrastructures tools\
    \ or \n \n15 There is no single source of data that provides a comprehensive view\
    \ of how much agricultural data in \nthe U.S. is being used. However, there have\
    \ been various studies and reports that suggest that while there is \na significant\
    \ amount of agricultural data being collected, much of it is not being fully utilized\
    \ or shared. For \nexample, a 2018 report by the USDA found that while the majority\
    \ of farmers were collecting data on their \noperations, many were not using it\
    \ to make management decisions. Similarly, a 2019 survey by the \nAmerican Farm\
    \ Bureau Federation found that while most farmers were using some type of precision\
    \ \nagriculture technology, many were not fully utilizing the data collected by\
    \ these technologies. Overall, \nthese studies suggest that while there is a significant\
    \ amount of agricultural data being collected, there may \nbe untapped potential\
    \ for its use in improving agricultural productivity and sustainability. USDA\

    \ ag data in the U.S. \n \nDiagram elaborated by the author \nIn the context of\
    \ analyzing agricultural data in the United States, it is necessary to \ndescribe\
    \ the data value chain. The term \"value chain\" refers to the steps taken to\
    \ \nincrementally add value and produce a final product or outcome (Brown, 2020,\
    \ p. 4). A \ndata value chain describes the information flow from raw data to\
    \ valuable insights in the \ncontext of big data systems (Cavanillas et al., 2021,\
    \ p. 29). This concept can be used to \norganize data activities and transform\
    \ processes into a series of steps that add value to data. \nThe definition of\
    \ an agricultural data value chain will aid in addressing challenges in \nagricultural\
    \ data governance in the context of agriculture's digital transformation. It entails\
    \ \n \n36 \nmanaging and coordinating data in a continuous flow from data generators\
    \ to decision-\nmakers16, which will aid in agricultural data governance (Miller\
    \ & Mork, 2013, p. 57). \nFigure 8 presents a data value chain adapted for the\
    \ purposes of this research, which \nencompasses six stages that can be grouped\
    \ into phases and potentially divided into sub-\nphases. \nFigure 8 A Data Value\
    \ Chain \n \nAdapted from Kosior (2019) \nThe utilization of a data value chain\
    \ in agriculture plays a crucial role in optimizing the \ntransformation of raw\
    \ data into valuable information. This process of transforming data \ninto smart\
    \ data involves the incremental addition of value at various stages of data input\
    \ \nactivities, data processing and transformation, and finally the generation\
    \ of high-quality \nand accurate data products (Brown, 2020, p.4). Currently,\
    \ the governance of agricultural \ndata value chains in the United States is primarily\
    \ governed by private contracts and \nagreements (Fisher & Streinz, 2021, p. 73),\
    \ which are complex in nature and provide data \nproducers or farmers with limited\
    \ negotiation power. \n \n16 Given this data cycle conceptual framework, in the\
    \ current digital and technological global context, the \neconomic dynamic is\
    \ becoming more data-driven when it comes to make decisions. This is what known\
    \ as \ndata economy. One of the main challenges “the data economy faces today\
    \ is the insufficient level of data \nsharing between public and private actors.”\

    \ \nData governance is defined by DAMA International (2015, p. 67) as the “exercise\
    \ of \nauthority and control (planning, monitoring, and enforcement) over the\
    \ management of \ndata assets.” The concept of governing data refers to the decision-making\
    \ processes \ninvolved in data management, as well as the expected data-related\
    \ behaviors and responses \nof individuals and processes (DAMA 2015, p. 68). Data\
    \ governance thus entails the \ncreation of a systematic decision-making framework\
    \ that outlines the various roles and \nresponsibilities associated with data\
    \ access. The goal is achieving organizational or sectoral \nobjectives such as\
    \ improving operational efficiency, mitigating risks, and gaining market \nadvantages\
    \ (Benfeldt et al., 2020, p. 301). \nFurthermore, data governance is frequently\
    \ described as a comprehensive system that \nincludes fundamental attributes or\
    \ characteristics. According to the Data Governance \nInstitute (DGI), as cited\
    \ in Al-Ruithe et al. (2019, p. 840), data governance is defined by \ndecision\
    \ rights and responsibilities regarding information-related procedures that are\
    \ \ncarried out in accordance with established models that specify who is authorized\
    \ to execute \nspecific actions with specific data, when, under what conditions,\
    \ and using what methods. \nFor the purposes of this doctoral dissertation, data\
    \ governance is defined as a \ncomprehensive system that includes decision-making\
    \ authority and accountability for \nmanaging data assets, with a focus on controlling\
    \ the flow of data by regulating its access, \nusability, quality, and security.\
    \ This definition includes the roles and responsibilities of \nnetwork members,\
    \ rules and processes, principles or standards that facilitate data practice \n\
    \ \n38 \ncoordination, and common goals. In this dissertation, the overarching\
    \ goal of data \ngovernance is to ensure that data is managed effectively as a\
    \ valuable asset. \n▪ \nData Governance Policy Framework \nThe World Bank's World\
    \ Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives (WDR21) \n(World Bank, 2021)\
    \ presents a data governance framework that outlines the legal and \nnormative\
    \ safeguards and enablers required to promote trust and foster the growth of a\
    \ \ndata-driven economy. WDR21 and Chen (2021) define safeguards as “norms and\
    \ legal \nframeworks that aim to protect the rights of individuals and entities\
    \ participating in the data \neconomy by addressing misuse of data or data breaches”\
    \ (Chen, 2021, p. 4). And enablers \nare defined as “norms and laws that facilitate\
    \ the use and reuse of data, such as data \nportability mechanisms and open data\
    \ legislation, (Chen, 2021, p. 4). Figure 9 illustrates \nthese two pillars as\
    \ critical components in creating an efficient data governance \nenvironment and\

    \ collected for \npublic purposes, regardless of the collection instrument or\
    \ the entity that manages the data\" \n(e.g., censuses and home surveys) (Chen,\

    \ 2021 \nIt is important to recognize that data governance is a continuous process\
    \ that involves \npeople17, processes, and technology. The primary goal of data\
    \ governance is to enhance \nthe value of data while minimizing the associated\
    \ costs and risks (Abraham et al., 2019, p. \n424). This highlights the ongoing\
    \ effort required to effectively manage data, as well as the \nimportance of effective\
    \ data governance practices. \n \n17 People is involved in generating, governing,\

    quence=1 \n \n44 \nIntroducing data governance into the agricultural sector can\
    \ help to ensure data quality \nwhile also ensuring its secure and open use. As\
    \ the agricultural sector continues to \ndigitalize its farming practices, agricultural\
    \ data governance becomes more important as it \npromotes desirable and responsible\
    \ agricultural data practices. The sector can ensure that \ndata is managed responsibly\
    \ and that its value is maximized while potential risks are \nminimized by implementing\
    \ effective data governance practices. \nUntil now, contractual agreements have\
    \ primarily governed the management of \nagricultural data. Contractual agreements\
    \ define the conditions under which data can be \ncollected, shared, and used\
    \ by farmers, producers, and digital technology providers. These \nagreements\
    \ define the parameters for data use and the extent to which data can be shared\
    \ \nwith third-party service providers, as well as the consequences of data misuse\
    \ or \nunauthorized access. These contracts, according to Casalini and Gray (2020),\
    \ determine \ndata sharing permissions and data ownership following contract termination.\
    \ According to \nMicheli et al. (2019), power imbalances and power relations can\
    \ have an impact on \ngovernance processes and value creation.  \nThese scholars\
    \ argue that civic society and public bodies play an important role in \ndemocratizing\
    \ data governance and redistributing value through data. This implies that, in\
    \ \naddition to addressing technical aspects of data governance, it is also necessary\
    \ to consider \nthe roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, as well\
    \ as how power dynamics and \ninformation asymmetries between them can affect\
    \ data governance in agriculture. \nAccording to Micheli et al. (2019), agricultural\
    \ data governance requires an examination \nof stakeholders' roles and responsibilities,\
    \ as well as the processes and mechanisms used \n \n45 \nas data strategies to\
    \ access, share, and use data. Thus, effective data governance in \nagriculture\
    \ needs not only addressing software, digital applications, or data platforms,\
    \ but \nalso power dynamics and information asymmetries between farmers and agricultural\
    \ \ntechnology service providers. \nThe Sense of Problem \nIn the United States,\
    \ the governance of agricultural data is currently an unstructured \nproblem,\
    \ meaning that it is a recently explored and discussed issue with various key\
    \ actors \nstill deliberating ideas. The issue of contractual agreements is a\
    \ particular challenge, \nresulting in low trust and tensions between farmers,\
    \ industry professionals, and \nagribusiness (Cue et al., 2021). Furthermore,\
    \ challenges associated with the transition from \nanalog to digital and smart\
    \ farming, as well as the generation of large amounts of \nagricultural data,\
    \ present additional difficulties. \nThe problem situation at hand is the digitalization\
    \ of agriculture18, which involves the \nadoption of innovative digital technologies\
    \ like artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, drones, \nand robotics to optimize\
    \ agricultural production systems, value chains, and food systems. \nHowever,\
    \ the growing reliance on digital tools in agriculture has resulted in disagreements\
    \ \nand tensions between farmers and agriculture technology providers, particularly\
    \ regarding \nagricultural data monetization (Cue et al., 2021, p. 11). This issue\
    \ has yet to be fully \nstructured, as agricultural data governance is a relatively\
    \ new concept being explored and \ndebated by key actors in this field. \n \n\
    18 The adoption, use, and adaptation of digital farming technologies in agriculture\
    \ daily practices.  \n \n46 \nIn the United States, the Code of Practice (COP)\
    \ and its fundamental principles \nrepresent an initial move towards establishing\
    \ reliable systems for the flow of agricultural \ndata that safeguard privacy\
    \ and security. Nonetheless, due to its voluntary and non-binding \nregulatory\
    \ nature, as well as the lack of evidence demonstrating its impact and outcomes\
    \ \nin promoting beneficial data practices for all stakeholders in this sector,\
    \ the it proves \ninsufficient to govern data in the agricultural industry. \n\
    There is a growing concern among farmers regarding the ambiguous use of data that\
    \ \narises from the implementation of digital farming technologies. The various\
    \ stakeholders \ninvolved, including farmers, agriculture tech providers, and\
    \ other agribusinesses, hold \ndifferent perspectives on the value of data and\
    \ its potential benefits. \nFarmers’ associations in the United States, for example,\
    \ have created data cooperative \nplatforms, while agribusinesses provide mobile\
    \ application services for data analysis. The \nAgriculture Network Information\
    \ Collaborative (AgNIC)19 is an example of an institution \ncooperating voluntarily\
    \ in the field of agricultural information and data management. \nAdditionally,\
    \ there are private business companies that deal with the storage and analysis\
    \ \nof agricultural data, including but not limited20 to the Agriculture Data\
    \ Coalition (ADC), \nFarmers Business Network (FBN), Growers Information Services\
    \ Coop. (GiSC), Open Ag \n \n19 AgNIC webpage: agnic.org \n20 Others, such as\
    \ the National Coalition for Food and Agricultural Research (NCFAR) (www.ncfar.org),\
    \ \na nonpartisan, consensus-based, and customer-led coalition or the Agricultural\
    \ Research Data Network \n(ARDN) (https://agmip.github.io/ARDN/). The goal of\
    \ ARDN is to build a distributed network for \nharmonized crop system research\
    \ data and make it available through existing data portals like the USDA's \n\
    Ag Data Commons. It provides researchers with tools and protocols that allow them\
    \ to not only share their \ndata, but also make it interoperable and reusable.\
    \ \n \n47 \nData Alliance, the National Agricultural Producers Data Cooperative\
    \ (NAPDC), and Ag \nTransparent. \nAgricultural data issues have been recognized\
    \ as a public concern in the United States \nand have been incorporated into legislative\
    \ policy-making agendas. Senators Amy \nKlobuchar and John Thune introduced the\
    \ Agricultural Data Act (Ag-Data Act) (115th \nCongress, 2017-2018) as an example\
    \ of how senators began to address agricultural data in \n2018. Senator Klobuchar\
    \ proposed that by using appropriate data collection, review, and \nanalysis methods,\
    \ knowledge of how conservation practices impact farm and ranch \nprofitability,\
    \ such as crop yields, soil health, and other risk-reducing factors, could be\
    \ \nexpanded (Thune et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the Agricultural Data Act Bill\
    \ makes no \nmention of the different types of data practices that exist in agricultural\
    \ data contracts \n(Janzen, 2018b). It is difficult to evaluate or \"determine\
    \ the precise information that will \nbe collected, how the USDA will obtain it,\
    \ and who will have access to, use, or share it\" \n(Janzen, 2018a). \nThe absence\
    \ of legal regulations to govern data sharing and usage in the U.S. \nagricultural\
    \ sector has raised concerns among farmers from specific agricultural industries\
    \ \n(Cue et al., 2021). For example, in response, farmers from the dairy industry,\
    \ are calling \nfor the introduction of legislation, proposing a \"Farmers Bill\
    \ of Rights\" to ensure fair and \ntransparent dairy data governance within an\
    \ ecosystem comprising farmers and industry \ncompanies (Cue et al., 2021, p.\
    \ 6). To support this legislative proposal, Cue et al. (2021) \nconducted a survey\
    \ as part of the Dairy Brain project at the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison\
    \ in 2021. The findings showed that 59% of farmers reported not having signed\
    \ a \ndata sharing agreement in the past five years, while 22% were unsure if\
    \ they had signed \n \n48 \none (unpublished data). Despite this, all farmers\
    \ eventually share their data in some way. \nHence, these concerns are considered\
    \ significant worldwide (Cue et al., 2021, p. 4). \nAccording to Jouanjean et\
    \ al. (2020), farmers are uncertain whether the data collected \nbelongs to them\
    \ or to third parties who provide technological tools. Additionally, Kosior \n\
    (2019a, p. 6) notes that the current network of organizations managing and utilizing\
    \ \nagricultural data operates under an outdated and fragmented regulatory framework.\
    \ The \nabsence of specific legal and regulatory frameworks for smart farming\
    \ data leads to \nmistrust in the farming community and inhibits farmers' willingness\
    \ to share their data. \nPolitical economic factors, such as a lack of a data-sharing\
    \ culture in government and \ninadequate coordination among government entities\
    \ (Cue et al., 2021, p. 11), can further \nhinder the exchange of public sector\
    \ agricultural data. The value of agricultural data that \nhas not been used to\
    \ its full potential is nil. \nIn the World Development Report 2021: Data for\
    \ Better Lives, the World Bank (World \nBank, 2021, p. 190) states that several\
    \ factors have the potential to undermine trust in the \nflow and use of data.\
    \ These include the lack of a legal framework, an inadequate \nimplementation\
    \ of laws, institutions and law enforcement that are weak, or the absence of \n\
    effective ways for parties to enforce their rights (World Bank, 2021, p. 190).\
    \ Additionally, \npractices that provide unfair advantages to certain actors,\
    \ incentives that are skewed or \nunbalanced, and poor or insecure infrastructure\
    \ are also contributing factors. \nIn addition to distrust in agreements with\
    \ ATPs, the OECD (2019a, p. 25) report entitled \n“Digital Opportunities for Better\
    \ Agricultural Policies” notes that farmers frequently lack \nthe necessary tools\
    \ and skills to effectively utilize data for decision-making. This includes \n\
    \ \n49 \ntools for data management and governance, which enable data sharing,\
    \ integration, and \nlinkage across various intelligent systems (OECD, 2019a,\
    \ p. 25). Intelligent systems rely \non big data analytics, cloud computing, machine-to-machine\
    \ communication, and the \nInternet of Things (IoT) (OECD, 2019b, p. 27) to generate\
    \ new and valuable information. \nWithout context, trends, or causal references,\
    \ individual data points are meaningless. The \nOECD report argues that combining\
    \ different types and sources of data can provide \nactionable insights not only\
    \ for farmers but also for regulators and policymakers, \nsignificantly increasing\
    \ the value of the data (OECD, 2019a, p. 26). \nGlobally, several organizations\
    \ are working towards advocating policy solutions for \nenhancing equitable agricultural\
    \ data practices. Some of these key organizations include \nthe Organization for\
    \ Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, \nGlobal Open Data\
    \ for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN), Global Forum on Agricultural \nResearch\
    \ and Innovation (GFAR), and the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience \nInternational\
    \ (CABI), among others. While these organizations emphasize different but \ninterconnected\
    \ facets of agricultural data governance, they promote varied and disjointed \n\
    solutions to the issue. \nWhile digital technologies like drones have shown promise\
    \ in providing efficient \nsolutions for farmers, the potential of the data they\
    \ generate is often underutilized. In an \narticle by Smith Thomas (2022), John\
    \ Church, an associate professor at Thompson Rivers \nUniversity in British Columbia\
    \ and the Regional Innovation Chair in cattle industry \nsustainability, describes\
    \ how drones are useful in monitoring cattle, from checking calving \npastures\
    \ to determining if an animal is sick or has an elevated body temperature. Despite\
    \ \nthese specific uses, it is unclear how the data generated by drones can be\
    \ effectively \n \n50 \ngoverned and utilized to contribute to the sustainability\
    \ of the agricultural sector and its \nsubsectors. \nCABI's Director of Data Policy\
    \ and Practice highlights the importance of addressing the \ninstitutional context\
    \ and the roles of various actors involved in agricultural data \ngovernance,\
    \ including farmers, industry and government statistical organizations, \ntechnology\
    \ businesses, and research institutions. According to the Director, achieving\
    \ real \nchange in agricultural data practices requires an improved data culture\
    \ where trust in data \nis earned and built over time, and where sustainable data\
    \ access is integrated into platforms \nfrom the outset. The Director emphasizes\
    \ the need to address data sharing and mitigate \nrisks during the development\
    \ of interventions, rather than treating them as an afterthought. \nThis approach\
    \ presents an opportunity to promote responsible data practices and to enhance\
    \ \nthe sustainability of the agricultural sector and subsectors. (GFAR Blog,\
    \ 2022, p.3) \nProblem Structuring Methods \nIn the realm of public policy, problem\
    \ structuring is an approach that aims to integrate \nmultiple alternative perspectives\
    \ or views regarding a particular problem situation \n(Rosenhead, 1996). From\
    \ a social stage perspective, structuring a policy problem requires \ntwo distinct\
    \ actions. The first is identifying the problem situation, while the second is\
    \ \nidentifying multiple representations or interpretations of the situation (Hoppe,\
    \ 2018, p. 14) \nfrom the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders. These\
    \ representations must highlight \nthe elements and factors that are contributing\
    \ to the policy problem.  \nThese methods help to identify the characteristics\
    \ of the problem, its type, and the stages \nrequired to structure it. The focus\
    \ is on understanding the problem situation within the \n \n51 \nconditions that\
    \ lead to conflicts or dissatisfaction. According to Dunn (2018, p.69), the \n\
    nature of a policy problem should be defined in terms of needs, values, or opportunities\
    \ for \nimproving or optimizing outcomes. For example, the need to govern agricultural\
    \ data, the \nvalues that underpin the agricultural sector, and the opportunities\
    \ that can be seized to do \nso must be clearly defined as a first step before\
    \ proposing any public policy alternatives. \nIn the case of agricultural data\
    \ governance, farmers are concerned about their contracts \nwith ATPs, lack of\
    \ trust and transparency in accessing, sharing, and using agricultural data, \n\
    as well as doubts about the benefits of using this data (Casalini & Gray, 2020).\
    \ \nAdditionally, the external conditions that contribute to the problem, such\
    \ as power \nasymmetries and data politics among agri-businesses, ATPs, and farmers,\
    \ need to be \ndefined, classified, and evaluated (Dunn, 2018, p.72). Understanding\
    \ the context is \nessential to comprehend the dynamics involved in current agricultural\
    \ data practices. \nWhen approaching the problem of structuring agricultural data\
    \ governance, it is \nessential to assess how stakeholders define the problem.\
    \ The goal is to accurately define \nthe problem in order to identify the appropriate\
    \ solution and avoid what Dunn (2018, p. \n80) refers to as the error of the third\
    \ type21. To this end, there are several methods that can \nbe employed, including\
    \ the problem structuring methods summarized in Table 9. \nTable 9 Characteristics\

    \ \nstakeholders: \nscholars, farmers, \nfarmer-led \nassociations, public, \n\
    and non-profit \nsector organizations \nAdapted from Dunn, 2018 \nThese three\
    \ problem-structuring methods aim to identify the essential elements that \nconstitute\
    \ a problem, including the conditions that lead to stakeholder concerns, mistrust,\
    \ \ndissatisfactions, conflicts, or tensions, as well as external factors. The\
    \ selected problem \nstructuring methods aim to capture diverse perspectives on\
    \ the problem situation to \nfacilitate consensus building on the problem definition.\
    \ Taken together, these methods \noffer a rigorous and comprehensive approach\
    \ to structuring the policy problem of \nagricultural data governance, providing\
    \ valuable insights that enhance the credibility, \ntransferability, and reliability\
    \ of this qualitative research. \nIn order to avoid the error of formulating and\
    \ solving the wrong policy problem (Dunn, \n2018, p.80), this research has selected\
    \ a total of 57 documents for analysis. These \n \n53 \ndocuments include a range\
    \ of sources such as scholarly papers, policy papers, discussion \npapers, industry\
    \ newspapers, research reports from international organizations, and \nwebinars’\
    \ content, all of which are focused on agricultural data practices. By using multiple\
    \ \ntext-data points22, the research benefits from a large number of sources,\
    \ which reduces the \nreliability problem that may arise from a heavy dependence\
    \ on a smaller set of sources. \nMoreover, the larger sample size of 57 text-data\
    \ sources used in this research reduces the \nlikelihood of random error. As a\
    \ result, the possibility of Type III error, which refers to \ndefining the wrong\
    \ problem, is significantly minimized. \nAdditionally, the probability of Type\
    \ II error, which results from structuring the problem \ntoo narrowly, is also\
    \ reduced because the high number of sampled text-data sources tends \nto bring\
    \ forth a greater number of problem elements during analysis. However, the \n\
    possibility of defining the problem too broadly, Type I error, is increased by\
    \ these problem \nstructuring methods. This outcome is due to the only stopping\
    \ rule being the accumulation \nof new problem elements. As such, it is important\
    \ to reassess the scope of the structured \nproblem at the policy formulation\
    \ stage to identify whether any elements are marginal or \nunnecessary. Such elements\
    \ may not contribute to the target problem that solutions seek to \nresolve. \
    \ \n \n22 \"Text-data points\" refer to individual pieces of text-based information\
    \ that are used in research or \nanalysis. By incorporating multiple text-data\
    \ points from a variety of sources, this research is better able to \naccount\
    \ for a range of perspectives and reduce the risk of bias or inaccuracies. \n\
    \ \n54 \n▪ \nContent Analysis \nContent analysis is a widely used method in qualitative\
    \ research for studying various \nphenomena. Its main objective is to uncover\
    \ the implicit meaning of textual data by \nquantifying the significance of written\
    \ language. It examines data present in messages and \ncommunication as opposed\
    \ to observable events or individual characteristics. In this study, \ncontent\
    \ analysis is defined as a “method for investigating social reality, which involves\
    \ \ndeducing the attributes of a non-apparent context [or phenomenon] from the\
    \ characteristics \nof an apparent text” (Krippendorff, 2004, p. 25). \nKrippendorff's\
    \ (2004) definition of content analysis emphasizes the importance of \ncontext\
    \ in analyzing text. By using content analysis to uncover the underlying meaning\
    \ of \ntext, this research can gain a more nuanced understanding of the complex\
    \ policy problem \nof agricultural data governance in the U.S. context. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach allows for \nthe identification of the key elements of the problem,\
    \ which can inform the subsequent use \nof network-based maps and boundary analysis\
    \ to structure the problem and identify \npotential solutions. \nThe process consists\
    \ of several steps to ensure the scientific rigor of the content analysis \nmethod\
    \ in this research. The first step involves defining the research question and\
    \ the scope \nof the analysis. This is followed by selecting the documents that\
    \ will be analyzed from \nvarious sources, including academic literature, policy\
    \ papers, reports, newsletters and \nnewspaper, and webinars’ content. The next\
    \ step involves pre-processing the data to ensure \nthat it was suitable for analysis.\
    \ \n \n55 \nPre-processing the data for this qualitative content analysis involves\
    \ data cleaning23, \ncoding, and categorization based on relevant themes, concepts,\
    \ or categories, which are \ndesigned to organize and analyze the text-data effectively.\
    \ In this research, the qualitative \ncontent analysis involves manual coding,\
    \ which is a widely used method for analyzing \ntextual data. Manual coding entails\
    \ identifying and labeling relevant text segments using \npredetermined categories\
    \ to identify patterns and themes within the selected qualitative \ndata. This\
    \ process helps to uncover key insights and themes and provides a more in-depth\
    \ \nunderstanding of stakeholders’ perspectives. \nFinally, the next step in the\
    \ process involves analyzing the coded data to generate \ninsights and develop\
    \ a problem structure that accurately captured the underlying issues and \nchallenges\
    \ related to agricultural data governance. This process ensures the validity,\
    \ \nreliability, and replicability of the content analysis method and provides\
    \ a clear and \ntransparent framework for conducting the analysis. \nFindings\
    \ from Content Analysis \nThe content analysis conducted in this research was\
    \ delimited to 57 text documents \npublished between October 2020 and May 2022.\
    \ The selection of this time frame was based \non pertinent events related to\
    \ text publications. Specifically, the report titled “Issues around \ndata governance\
    \ in the digital transformation of agriculture: The farmers’ perspective” by \n\
    Jouanjean et al. (2020) published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\
    \ and \nDevelopment, and the report by Ristino and Hart (2022) titled “Modernizing\
    \ Agriculture \n \n23 Data cleaning involves removing irrelevant or extraneous\
    \ information and ensuring that the data is \nconsistent and accurate. This may\
    \ involve checking for inconsistencies, correcting errors, and removing \nduplicates\
    \ \n \n56 \nData Infrastructure to Improve Economic and Ecological Outcomes” published\
    \ by the Data \nFoundation. The literature search query was crafted as follows:\
    \ “agricultural data” or “farm \ndata” or “agricultural data and data governance”\
    \ or “digital technology and agricultural \ndata” or “agricultural data and regulations\
    \ or legal.” Nonetheless, a few documents dated \nfrom 2017, 2018, and 2019 were\
    \ included in the analysis due to their relevance to the \nresearch theme and\
    \ the scarcity of documents addressing the governance of agricultural \ndata.\
    \ The search was conducted based on the criterion that each document addresses\
    \ the \nuse of digital technologies and agricultural data. \nAn initial inventory\
    \ of themes was developed through an inductive thematic analysis of \nthe text\
    \ data set, with the aim of openly codifying text data into interrelated information\
    \ \ncategories (Creswell, 2007). To group codes into a category set, Dey (1993:\
    \ 100) suggests \ninterpreting the data to analyze it. This step requires a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the \ntext to isolate features that may lead to the identification\
    \ of policy problems related to \nagricultural data. \nMoreover, creating categories\
    \ involves grouping related data. The process of grouping \ndata or establishing\
    \ relationships creates categories that are conceptually and empirically \ngrounded.\
    \ That is, categories must be grounded in “relevant empirical [text] material\
    \ and \nrelate to an appropriate analytic context” (Dey, 1993: 102). Table 10\

    \ author \nIn this study, the selected texts were classified based on their sources,\
    \ representing \ndifferent stakeholders in U.S. agriculture. The first classification\
    \ type includes scholars and \ntheir peer-reviewed articles. The second stakeholder\
    \ is the media that covers agriculture \nand digital technologies. The third stakeholder\
    \ is farm association publications and news, \nand the final stakeholder is represented\
    \ by reports and publications from international \norganizations. \n \n59 \n▪\
    \ \nVOS-Viewer Software Analysis  \nThe second method used in this study was the\
    \ VOSviewer software24, which was used \nas a tool to create and visualize maps\
    \ based on network25 data (van Eck & Waltman, 2021, \np. 3). This software utilizes\
    \ text data from reference manager files to create the maps (van \nEck & Waltman,\
    \ 2021, pp. 26–27). The input data for VOSviewer was imported from the \nreference\
    \ repository created in Zotero. The \"network visualization\" option was selected\
    \ \nfrom among the visualization options provided by the software to visualize\
    \ the problem of \nagricultural data. \nTo refine the settings and create the\
    \ map, this research used the objects of interest or \nitems26 (van Eck & Waltman,\
    \ 2021, p. 5) that were identified from the key themes and \nkeywords in the text\
    \ data set. The map includes only the items and links between them, \nrepresenting\
    \ the connections or relations between two or more items. For example, co-\noccurrence\
    \ links were used to represent the number of publications in which certain terms\
    \ \noccur together, based on the keywords identified in each text selected as\
    \ a data source. \nThe software's useful contribution to the policy problem structuring\
    \ process is its ability \nto group each item or keyword into clusters, based\
    \ on their characteristics such as weight \n \n24 VOSviewer “can be used to construct\
    \ networks of scientific publications, scientific journals, \nresearchers, research\
    \ organizations, countries, keywords, or terms. Items in these networks can be\
    \ \nconnected by co-authorship, co-occurrence, citation, bibliographic coupling,\
    \ or co-citation links.” (van Eck \nand Waltman, 2021, p. 3) \n25 A “network is\
    \ a set of items together with the links between the items.” (van Eck and Waltman,\
    \ 2021, \np. 5) \n26 Other types of items to create maps in VOSviewer could be\
    \ for example publications, researchers, or \nterms (tags or key terms). \n \n\
    60 \nand score attributes27. In this case, the weight attributes are the links\
    \ and total link strength \nbetween items based on their co-occurrence28. The\
    \ software then labels the clusters using \ncluster numbers and different colors\
    \ to represent their connections. Figure 11 shows the \ngraphic created by VOSviewer,\
    \ which visualizes the networks constructed based on the \ninput data extracted\
    \ from the text sources reviewed. This serves as a complementary tool \nto the\
    \ categories reflected in the content analysis. \nRelevant factors related to\
    \ agricultural data governance were clearly revealed by \nvisualizing and exploring\
    \ the map created by VOSviewer. As a tool for addressing policy \nproblems, VOSviewer\
    \ effectively identified key themes and keywords related to \nagricultural data\
    \ governance. Through the analysis of the literature sources examined, the \n\
    software discovered a total of 35 co-occurring items or keywords. \n \n27 Both\
    \ attributes are represented by numerical values. For example, “A weight of an\
    \ item should in some \nway indicate the importance of the item. An item with\
    \ a higher weight is regarded as more important than \nan item with a lower weight…\
    \ A score attribute may indicate any numerical property of items.” (van Eck \n\
    and Waltman, 2021, p. 6) \n28 For any item this is “the number of links of an\
    \ item with other items and the total strength of the links \nof an item with\
    \ other items.” (van Eck and Waltman, 2021, p. 6) \n \n61 \nFigure 11 Keywords\
    \ co-occurrence network-based map of agricultural data problem \n \nFigure 11\
    \ displays a co-occurrence network based on high-frequency agricultural data \n\
    keywords found in the selected text data sources. VOSviewer's default colors were\
    \ used to \nindicate the five clusters of agricultural keywords, with lines showing\
    \ the distance between \nthe keywords. The red color represents the smart farming\
    \ cluster, with main connection \nlines to trust and data ownership. The blue\
    \ lines connect the transparency cluster, yellow \nlines present the code of conduct\
    \ cluster, green lines represent the data sharing cluster, and \npurple lines\
    \ depict the agricultural policy cluster. The distance between the keywords on\
    \ \nthe network indicates the level of co-occurrence and their relationship. The\
    \ closer the \ndistance, the higher the co-occurrence and stronger the relationship\
    \ between the keywords. \n \n62 \nIn addition to complementing the content analysis,\
    \ this map provides further insight into \nthe key policy problem factors related\
    \ to agricultural data governance. By clustering related \nkeywords according\
    \ to their co-occurrence and highlighting their connections, the map \nilluminates\
    \ the interrelationships between various themes and sheds light on their relevance\
    \ \nto the overarching policy problem. Thus, the map enhances our understanding\
    \ of the \ncomplex and multifaceted issues involved in governing agricultural\
    \ data. \nOne limitation of using VOSviewer is that it relies solely on text data\
    \ from reference \nmanager files, which may not capture all relevant sources on\
    \ a particular topic. To address \nthis, future studies could consider using multiple\
    \ sources of data, such as social media, \ngovernment reports, or interviews with\
    \ stakeholders, to provide a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of the policy\
    \ problem.  \n▪ \nBoundary Analysis \nBoundary analysis is a method used to define\
    \ the key elements of a policy problem by \nincorporating input from stakeholders\
    \ who have explicit knowledge or experience with the \ntopic (Dunn, 2018). The\
    \ aim of the boundary analysis method in this study is to specify \nand conclude\
    \ the structuring of the policy problem for governing agricultural data based\
    \ \non the key themes identified in the previous content analysis and software\
    \ analysis. The \npurpose of this approach is to estimate \"whether the system\
    \ of individual problem \nformulations … is relatively complete\" (Dunn, 2018,\
    \ p. 89). In other words, the goal is to \nidentify multiple problems that are\
    \ defined in different ways by key stakeholders in the \nagriculture sector. Overall,\
    \ this analysis seeks to establish the boundaries necessary to \nformulate the\
    \ policy problem of governing agricultural data in a comprehensive manner. \n\
    \ \n63 \nDunn's (2018) three-step process for boundary analysis includes saturation\
    \ sampling, \nelicitation of problem representation, and boundary estimation.\
    \ The first step, saturation \nsampling, involves an exhaustive review of biographic\
    \ references in selected documents to \nidentify additional actors or stakeholders\
    \ who discuss agricultural data issues. This process \ncontinues until no new\
    \ references are found, ensuring that a comprehensive list of \nstakeholders is\
    \ identified. The next step, elicitation of problem representation, involves a\
    \ \nsystematic analysis of stakeholder descriptions of the problem. This analysis\
    \ may include \ninterviews, surveys, or other means of gathering information from\
    \ stakeholders. The final \nstep, boundary estimation, involves identifying the\
    \ key elements or boundaries of the \nproblem by analyzing the stakeholder descriptions\
    \ and identifying areas of agreement or \ndisagreement. By following this three-step\
    \ process, boundary analysis can provide a \ncomprehensive and structured approach\
    \ to understanding the policy problem of governing \nagricultural data. \nThe\
    \ content analysis method was used to obtain \"problem representations from \n\
    stakeholders\" (Dunn, 2018, p. 91). Each text data set was revisited to select\
    \ text units that \nexplained how each actor or stakeholder described the issues\
    \ of data governance for farm \ndata. The context for the content under analysis\
    \ was provided by scholars, farm \nassociations, news sites in agriculture, and\
    \ publications from international organizations. \nFinally, the boundary estimation\
    \ process involved summing the cumulative frequency of \nkey agricultural data\
    \ problems from all text-data sources. A brief explanation of the three-\nstep\
    \ process is shown in Figure 12 and boundary estimations is displayed in a pareto\
    \ chart \nin Figure 13. \n \n64 \nFigure 12 Explanation of the boundary analysis\
    \ three-step process \n \nAdapted from Dunn 2018 \nThe first step involved accessing\
    \ written descriptions of the problem by stakeholders in \nthe agricultural sector\
    \ using text data sets collection. From the available documents, the \nsecond\
    \ step involved identifying problem representations within the bounded system\
    \ of \nstakeholders. These are \"ideas, basic paradigms, dominant metaphors, standard\
    \ operating \nprocedures, ... by which [stakeholders] attach meaning to events\"\
    \ (Dunn, 2018, p. 91). The \nthird step, represented by the Pareto chart in Figure\
    \ 12, shows the estimated boundary of \nthe key agricultural data problems that\
    \ were identified through content analysis. The Pareto \nchart primarily organizes\
    \ the count of themes, subthemes, and keywords obtained from the \ncontent analysis.\
    \ The revision of these themes was also compared with the keywords \nvisualized\
    \ in the VOSviewer map. \n• Thorough \nexamination of \nbiographic      \nreferences\

    \ above provided the basis for defining a set of problem \ndimensions. The key\
    \ agricultural data items were classified into four dimensions: data \nsharing,\
    \ data production cycle, data rights and norms, and smart farming. Figure 14 \n\
    provides an overview of the most important dimensions of the policy problem, based\
    \ on \nthe results of the content analysis, VOSviewer software, and boundary analysis.\

    \ relevant dimensions in the agricultural data governance \npolicy problem \n\
    \ \nThe identified dimensions of the agricultural data governance problem emphasize\
    \ the \nimportance of a data governance policy framework that establishes guidelines,\
    \ standards, \nand roles to facilitate data sharing across the agriculture sectors\
    \ in the United States. This \nframework should focus on developing trustworthy\
    \ data-sharing systems and environments \nthrough mechanisms and measures that\
    \ enable agricultural data access and use. To achieve \nthis, the agricultural\
    \ data governance framework should prioritize trust and transparency \nin data\
    \ sharing, enhance mechanisms to increase data availability, and overcome technical\
    \ \nbarriers to data reuse within the sector. Such measures will enhance the value\
    \ and benefits \nthat the agriculture sector can derive from agricultural data,\
    \ transforming it into a smart \nand digitally transformed industry. \nThe use\
    \ of the three methods aimed to identify and map different perspectives on \n\
    agricultural data governance, and structure it as a policy problem through a multi-\n\

    \ However, it is important to note that these methods have a moderate \nlevel\
    \ of replicability, as they rely on general guidelines and specific descriptions\
    \ that may \nbe subject to researcher subjectivity and research context. \nThe\
    \ policy problem of agricultural data governance, as currently structured and\
    \ \nassuming its proper structuring, appears to be a broad but relatively well-organized\
    \ and \nmoderately complex policy problem. To further evaluate the agricultural\
    \ data policy \nproblem, ten wicked problem characteristics developed by Rittel\
    \ and Weber (1973) were \nused to demonstrate the moderately structured nature\
    \ of this problem. These characteristics \nare presented in Table 11. \nTable\

    \ \nSecondary/Functional \nAdapted from Rittel and Weber 1973 \n \n68 \nAccording\
    \ to Mitroff (1974, p. 224 in Dunn, 2018), well-structured problems are those\
    \ \nfor which enough information is available to understand their sources and\
    \ develop feasible \npolicy solutions. While the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem is complex, it is \nmoderately well-defined, with evidence available\
    \ to help settle differences between \nstakeholders. Unlike a value-based problem,\
    \ this policy problem is not solely based on \nconflicting values or preferences,\
    \ but rather on practical challenges related to data sharing \nand management.\
    \ The policy solutions developed in the agriculture sector could be applied \n\
    to other sectors facing similar challenges. \nThe policy problem of agricultural\
    \ data governance is a complex and evolving issue, \nwith multiple stakeholders\
    \ involved in the governance of agricultural data, including \nfarmers, agricultural\
    \ technology providers, tech companies, and agribusiness. As data \nbecomes increasingly\
    \ central to agricultural production, there is a growing need to establish \n\
    guidelines, standards, and roles to facilitate data sharing and use across the\
    \ sector.  \nAdditionally, as the volume of agricultural data continues to increase,\
    \ there is a need for \nmechanisms to ensure data privacy and security, as well\
    \ as to address cybersecurity risks. \nFurthermore, there is a need to overcome\
    \ technical barriers to data reuse and establish \ntrustworthy data-sharing environments\
    \ to increase trust and transparency in the sector. \nOverall, a governance framework\
    \ for agricultural data is essential to maximize the sector's \nbenefits and value,\
    \ transforming it into a smart and digitally transformed industry. \n \n69 \n\
    Chapter 3: Policy Options \nThis chapter employs a comparative case analysis approach\
    \ to propose three distinct \npolicy options for agricultural data governance,\
    \ aimed at addressing the policy problem \nidentified in Chapter 2. The methods\
    \ used for the comparative case analysis include bench-\nmarking and lesson-drawing.\
    \ \nThe policy options, labeled as minimal, moderate, and maximal, are designed\
    \ to offer \ndistinctive solutions to the policy problem. To develop these options,\
    \ this research maps \nthe existing policy frameworks in other jurisdictions and\
    \ explore the potential \ntransferability of legal provisions to the agricultural\
    \ data governance context in the U.S. \nThis approach aims to fill the legal void\
    \ that currently exists in the U.S. agriculture sector \nregarding the governance\
    \ of agricultural data.  \nGeneric Standards \nMost legal regulations and policy\
    \ provisions that govern data are structured around two \nmain components: safeguards\
    \ and enablers. These components include standards for \nprotecting personal and\
    \ non-personal data, as well as ensuring secure mechanisms and \nprocesses for\
    \ the flow of private and public intent data sharing. Examples of these \nregulations\
    \ and policies include the \"Gramm-Leach Bliley\" Act (GLBA) for the financial\
    \ \nservice industry, the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability\
    \ Act (HIPAA) for \nthe healthcare industry, and the California Consumer Privacy\
    \ Act (CCPA). However, in \nthe United States, agricultural data is currently\
    \ governed by contracts and licensing \nagreements controlled by private agricultural\
    \ corporations. This practice creates an \n \n70 \nenvironment where farmers and\
    \ primary producers have limited bargaining power and little \nincentive to share\
    \ their data.  \nThe Global Data Regulation Diagnostic publication from the World\
    \ Bank (Chen, 2021) \npresents a detailed assessment of laws and regulations on\
    \ data governance. Its content \ncovers both safeguards and enablers for data\
    \ governance across 80 countries ranging from \nlow to high-income groups (Chen,\
    \ 2021, p. 1). Figure 15 provides a useful overview of the \ndifferent components\
    \ of a data governance framework29 that can be used to guide the \nanalysis of\
    \ policy options for agricultural data governance in the U.S. \n \n29 A framework\
    \ understood as a structured and well-defined description of the data activities\
    \ upon which \na policy should be built. A policy framework in this research establishes\
    \ a set of criteria for selecting \nfeatures, elements, components, or mechanisms\
    \ from each existing data governance regulation that could \nsolve the agricultural\
    \ data problem in the United States. \n \n71 \nFigure 15 Data Governance Policy\
    \ Framework Components considered for Agricultural \nData \n \nAdapted from Chen,\
    \ 2021 \nSafeguards refer to norms or legal regulations that aim to protect the\
    \ data-related rights \nof market players, while enablers are norms or laws that\
    \ aim to facilitate the use and re-use \nof data (Chen, 2021). Both pillars, safeguards\
    \ and enablers, contain components that foster \ntrust and transparency among\
    \ stakeholders in governing data.  \nBy drawing on the best practices and lessons\
    \ learned from other jurisdictions, this \nresearch aims to develop a set of policy\
    \ options for agricultural data governance in the \nUnited States. These policy\
    \ options will be based on a comparative case analysis of existing \n \n72 \n\
    data governance frameworks30, with a particular focus on the regulatory components\
    \ of the \nCodes of Practice, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Health Insurance\
    \ and \nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the California Consumer Privacy\
    \ Act \n(CCPA), and the EU Data Governance Act. The selection of these laws and\
    \ regulations \nwas based on their relevance to the data governance dimensions,\
    \ which include both \nsafeguards and enablers, and their potential to address\
    \ some of the challenges in the \nagricultural sector.  \nThe Codes of Practice\
    \ provide principles and guidelines to promote responsible data \npractices. The\
    \ GLBA and HIPAA have frameworks for safeguarding personal data, which \nare important\
    \ considerations in the agricultural sector where personal data such as financial\
    \ \ninformation, bank loans and credit scores, and land ownership information\
    \ may be \ncollected from farmers. The CCPA has provisions for regulating the\
    \ use of non-personal \ndata, which are relevant for the agricultural sector where\
    \ both types of data (personal and \nnon-personal31) are generated and shared.\
    \ \nOne of the key challenges in agricultural data governance is balancing the\
    \ need for \nprivacy and data protection with the benefits of data sharing and\
    \ collaboration. On the one \nhand, farmers and other primary producers need to\
    \ be able to trust that their data will be \nkept confidential and used only for\
    \ agreed-upon purposes. On the other hand, data sharing \ncan lead to important\
    \ insights and innovations that can benefit the entire agricultural sector. \n\
    \ \n30 These frameworks include a mix of safeguards and enablers, such as data\
    \ protection regulations, data \nsharing agreements, and technical standards for\
    \ data interoperability. However, there is no one-size-fits-all \nsolution to\
    \ data governance, and policymakers must carefully consider the unique context\
    \ of their own \njurisdiction when developing data governance policies. \n31 Non-personal\
    \ data in the agriculture sector are agronomic data, such as soil type, crop type,\
    \ planting \ndensity, fertilization, and pesticide usage. \n \n73 \nFinding a\
    \ good balance between these competing interests is a difficult but necessary\
    \ task \nfor this study. \nCodes of Practice \nThis section analyzes four Codes\
    \ of Practice (COPs), also known as Codes of Conduct. \nCOPs are industry-led\
    \ self-regulatory frameworks for agricultural data practices. These \nCOPs aim\
    \ to promote good agricultural data practices among farmers, producers, and \n\
    agribusiness companies or ATPs. They comprise voluntary sets of rules based on\
    \ principles \n(Sanderson et al., 2018) and are intended to shape the behavior\
    \ of business or community \norganizations, and are enforced by the industry or\
    \ sector itself (Sanderson, 2019, p.6). \nThese codes address issues such as data\
    \ ownership providing definitions and best practices \nfor the management of agricultural\
    \ data. While adherence to these COPs is voluntary, they \noffer a framework for\
    \ stakeholders in the agriculture sector to work together and promote \nresponsible,\
    \ responsive, and transparent data contracting practices. \nCurrently, there are\
    \ only four codes available: the U.S. Farm Bureau Privacy and \nSecurity Principles\
    \ for Farm Data, the EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing \nby Contractual\
    \ Agreement, the New Zealand Farm Data Code of Practice, and the \nAustralian\
    \ Farm Data Code. These codes are relatively new, with the U.S. and New \nZealand\
    \ pioneering the launch of their codes of agricultural data practices in 2014,\
    \ \nsupported by private agriculture industry associations and businesses, and\
    \ in some cases, \nwith governmental assistance. \n \n74 \nWhile COPs represent\
    \ an initial collaborative effort to promote awareness about the \nvalue of agricultural\
    \ data among farmers, producers, and ATPs, they are relatively new32, \nnon-binding,\
    \ and their impact, effects, and consequences in terms of effectively governing\
    \ \nagricultural data between farmers and ATPs, as well as agribusiness companies,\
    \ remain \nunknown. According to Sanderson et al. (2018, p. 15), given the voluntary\
    \ nature of the \nfour existing COPs, there are additional challenges at the macro\
    \ structural-institutional \nlevel. These include the appropriation of an agile\
    \ agricultural data normative framework33, \nthe extension and implementation\
    \ of COPs, issues around trademark-based logos created \nfrom these codes, and\
    \ the assessment of the effects or consequences of existing COPs.  \nThe question\
    \ of whether self-policing by farm associations and agribusiness groups is \n\
    sufficient or whether additional oversight is necessary is complex. On the one\
    \ hand, \nallowing industry stakeholders to regulate themselves can be more efficient\
    \ and responsive \nto sector-specific issues, but on the other hand, it can also\
    \ lead to conflicts of interest and \na lack of accountability. \nIn this scenario,\
    \ the COPs are not mandatory and lack legal enforceability, thus the \nparties\
    \ engaged in data contracts have complete discretion over their adherence. Therefore,\
    \ \nthere is a possibility that certain parties may not adhere to the principles\
    \ outlined in the \ncodes, or that various stakeholders may interpret and implement\
    \ them inconsistently. \nThese four COPs have three general goals. First, to raise\
    \ awareness among farmers and \nproducers about the importance of agricultural\
    \ data. Second, to empower them to use data \n \n32 Most of them have been in\
    \ force since 2014. \n33 Sanders et al (2018) understand as an agile ag-data normative\
    \ framework as the set of rules, norms or \nprinciples regulating or norming the\
    \ agricultural data practices. \n \n75 \nto build a profitable future. And third,\
    \ to encourage agribusiness companies and ATPs to \nadopt more responsible, responsive,\
    \ and transparent data contracting practices. These \ncodes serve as the foundation\
    \ for resolving sector concerns related to agricultural data \ngovernance, including\
    \ issues around data ownership. \nThese COPs propose a collective action approach\
    \ to empower farmers and primary \nproducers to pursue transparent transactions\
    \ or practices of agricultural data through \ncontractual agreements. They are\
    \ based on definition of core principles and best practices \nfor agricultural\
    \ data, involving all stakeholders willing to comply, from farmers and \nproducers\
    \ to agribusiness and technology providers. According to Sanderson et al. (2018,\
    \ \np. 2), the purpose of agricultural codes of practice is \"inextricably linked\
    \ to consent, \ndisclosure, transparency, and ultimately, the building of trust.\"\
    \  \nOther contributions from all of these COPs include the specification of terms\
    \ and \ndefinitions. For example, the EU-COD defines what a data originator34\
    \ is, what their rights \nare, and data pseudonymization35. In the case of the\
    \ Australian Agricultural Data Rules, it \ncovers the concepts of data governance,\
    \ management, and implementation. It includes a \ncapacity and capability-building\
    \ component to educate farmers, as well as a risk, \nregulation, and compliance\
    \ component to ensure cybersecurity. \nAll of the principles embodied in these\

    \ exclusive right to license access to \nthe data and control its downstream to\
    \ use or re-use” (EU-CoD, 2018) \n35 Data pseudonymization is the “procedure in\
    \ which the most revealing fields within a data record are \nreplaced by one or\
    \ more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms.” (EU-CoD, 2018). Its main purpose\
    \ is to \n“render the data record less identifiable and therefore lower the risks\
    \ involved in its use” \n \n76 \ncodes of practice are based on consensus and\
    \ agreements among interested farm \nassociations, agribusiness companies, and\
    \ other agricultural industry organizations. The \nrole of the government in promoting\
    \ credibility and legitimacy in the principles promoted \nby COPs, as well as\
    \ monitoring compliance with them, is important. Governments can \nserve as a\
    \ third-party enforcer of compliance with the principles and act as a mediator\
    \ in \ncases of disputes. \n▪ \nNew Zealand Farm Data Code of Practice \nThe Farm\
    \ Data Code of Practice Version 1.1 was launched in New Zealand in 201436 \nafter\
    \ extensive consultation and planning across the agriculture sector. This code\
    \ provides \nguidelines for effective data sharing in the country's agriculture\
    \ industry and is adhered to \nby organizations such as Dairy NZ, the Red Meat\
    \ Profit Partnership, and the Ministry of \nPrimary Industries to ensure that\
    \ farmers' information is handled appropriately. The code \noffers recommended\
    \ standards and requirements for collecting, storing, and sharing \nagricultural\
    \ data and is owned and operated by Farm Data Accreditation Ltd (FDAL), an \n\
    independent company whose shareholders include the industry representative \n\
    organizations that created and mandated the code. \nThe Farm Data Code of Practice\
    \ in New Zealand regulates organizations that collect, \nstore, and share primary\
    \ agriculture data, with a focus on implementing practices that \nprovide primary\
    \ producers37  with confidence regarding their data security. Registered \n \n\
    36 According to the New Zealand Code of Practice, in “April 2015, ownership of\
    \ the Farm Data Code of \nPractice was transferred to an independent company,\
    \ Farm Data Accreditation Limited.” More information \navailable at:   \n37 “Primary\
    \ producers” is the term used to refer to farmers in the New Zealand COP. \n \n\
    77 \norganizations have agreed to disclose their practices and policies related\
    \ to data rights, \nprocessing, sharing, storage, and security (FDAL, 2016) to\
    \ increase data sharing securely \nwithin the sector and promote innovation in\
    \ services and products.  \nFDAL, an independent company, oversees the Code and\
    \ provides administrative and \noperation services to agriculture companies with\
    \ an annual license, certificate, and \npermission to use the trademark. FDAL\
    \ also has an executive board that receives \ncomplaints about noncompliance with\
    \ the principles, and determines whether agricultural \ncompanies' logos should\
    \ be renewed on an annual basis, making it a safeguard for farmers \nand agribusiness.\
    \ The distinctive roles and responsibilities of FDAL are what distinguish \nthis\
    \ code from the others, and will be considered for the purposes of this research.\
    \ \n▪ \nEuropean Union Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing \nby Contractual\
    \ Agreement \nIn the European Union38, a coalition of European farm associations39\
    \ from the EU agri-\nfood chain launched the Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data\
    \ Sharing by Contractual \nAgreement in 2018. Prior to these Code, agricultural\
    \ data was collected, stored, and used \n \n38 See Kosior, K. 2019 “From Analogue\
    \ to Digital Agriculture. Policy and Regulatory Framework for \nAgricultural Data\

    (FEFAC), and European Seed Association (ESA).  \n \n \n78 \nby public institutions\
    \ (Kosior, 2019b), but the rapid development and implementation of \nfarming technologies\
    \ that generate large amounts of data highlighted the need for the Code \nof Conduct.\
    \ \nThis COP was developed with the input of various stakeholders from the agri-food\
    \ value \nchain, including farmers, agri-businesses, and public institutions.\
    \ This collaborative \napproach helped ensure that the guidelines are practical,\
    \ effective, and widely accepted. \nInitially, nine agro-associations40 developed\
    \ the guidelines for processing and sharing \nagricultural data in the EU Code.\
    \ The Code of Conduct was created to promote access to \naccurate agricultural\
    \ data, which is a crucial step \"to develop digital farming enabling \nfarmers\
    \ to produce more using fewer resources\" (Koerhuis, 2018, p.1). It provides guidance\
    \ \non the use of agricultural data, particularly on the rights to access and\
    \ use the data. It \nincludes a checklist as well as key guidelines for operators\
    \ to follow. Janzen (2018) and \nKoerhuis (2018) suggest that granting access\
    \ to agricultural data will facilitate and \naccelerate data-driven business models\
    \ in this sector. \nThis COP fosters a dialogue among all stakeholders in the\
    \ agri-food value chain \n(Wiseman et al., 2019, p. 7) to encourage fair and transparent\
    \ contractual agreement rules \nfor data sharing. Unlike the codes in the United\
    \ States and New Zealand, the European \nUnion's Code of Conduct provides specific\
    \ definitions to govern contracts between farmers \nand agri-business, preventing\
    \ contractual agreements from being misinterpreted.  \n \n40 Since 2018, the government\
    \ has partnered with industry associations such as Copa-Cogeca40, European \n\
    Agricultural Machinery (CEMA), Fertilizers Europe, the European Confederation\
    \ of Agricultural, Rural \nand Forestry Contractors (CEETTAR), European Council\
    \ of Young Farmers (CEJA), European Crop \nProtection Association (ECPA), European\
    \ Forum of Farm Animal Breeders (EFFAB), European Feed \nManufacturers' Federation\
    \ (FEFAC), and European Space Agency (ESA). \n \n79 \nThe Code of Conduct establishes\
    \ guidelines focusing on the rights and obligations \nassociated with the use\
    \ and sharing of agricultural data. It uses a \"compliance tool\" \n(Wiseman et\
    \ al. 2019, p.9) which is a contract checklist for agricultural data, to ensure\
    \ a \ntrustworthy environment to construct data-driven business models that benefit\
    \ all \nstakeholders involved in using a product or service that collects or uses\
    \ agricultural data. \nAccording to van der Burg et al. (2021, p. 6), the EU COP's\
    \ key features are its five \nprinciples: data ownership, data access, control\
    \ and portability, data protection and \ntransparency, privacy and security, and\
    \ intellectual property rights. \nOne additional point to consider regarding the\
    \ EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural \nData Sharing is the important role that\
    \ data standardization plays in its implementation. \nStandardization is critical\
    \ for ensuring data compatibility and interoperability between \ndifferent stakeholders\
    \ in the agricultural sector, as well as for improving the quality of the \ndata\
    \ itself. The EU Code of Conduct specifically encourages the use of existing standards\
    \ \nfor data exchange and storage, such as the ISO 1178341 standard for agricultural\
    \ technology \nand the AgGateway ADAPT framework42. This emphasis on standardization\
    \ helps to \n \n41 ISO 11783, also known as the Tractor Implement Management System\

    \ protocol for electronic control units (ECUs) used in agricultural machinery,\
    \ \nallowing them to exchange data and communicate with one another. The standard\
    \ covers a wide range of \nfunctions, including the exchange of data between tractors\

    \ Data Rules: Enabling Best Practices  \nThe Agricultural Data Rules were developed\
    \ in Australia and published in February \n2020 with the support of the National\
    \ Farmers’ Federation and the Australian Government \nDepartment of Agriculture,\
    \ Water and the Environment. This code was developed as part \nof the \"Growing\
    \ a digital future for Australian Agriculture\" program, and originated from \n\
    the ‘Accelerating precision agriculture to decision agriculture: Enabling digital\
    \ agriculture \nin Australia’ (P2D) project which evaluated the desired state\
    \ of digital agriculture in the \ncountry (Wiseman, 2019). \nThe National Farmers'\
    \ Federation partnered with a range of stakeholders, including \nfarmers, industry\
    \ bodies, government agencies, and technology providers. These \npartnerships\
    \ were critical in ensuring that the code was tailored to the needs of Australian\
    \ \nfarmers and industry participants, while also providing a framework for collaboration\
    \ and \ninnovation in the sector. \n \nsoftware applications used in agriculture.\
    \ The ADAPT framework provides a set of standard application \nprogramming interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that can be used to integrate different agricultural software systems,\
    \ such as \nfarm management systems, precision agriculture tools, and machinery\
    \ control systems. The framework is \ndesigned to be flexible and scalable, allowing\
    \ it to adapt to different types of data and workflows used in \nagriculture.\
    \ The ADAPT framework enables users to access data from different sources and\
    \ use it to inform \ndecision-making, improving the efficiency and profitability\
    \ of agricultural operations. Information \navailable at: AGGateway. (2021). AGGateway\

    \ \n \n81 \nThe main objective of the Agricultural Data Rules is to not only develop\
    \ a data rules \nframework, but also to include an action plan that will create\
    \ an enabling environment for \ndigital innovation in Australian agricultural\
    \ industries (Wiseman & Sanderson, 2020, p. 3). \nThis code incorporates definitions\
    \ and principles from both the EU and New Zealand \nCOPs, making it a more robust\
    \ and comprehensive code for addressing the agricultural \ndata problem in Australia.\
    \ \nTo facilitate agricultural innovation through data-driven decision-making\
    \ and a reliable \nflow of agricultural data, the Australian Agricultural Data\
    \ Rules are structured around three \nkey pillars: people, responsibilities, and\
    \ structures. The roles of individuals handling \nagricultural data are essential\
    \ to the success of the code, and the \"capacity and capability\" \nand \"risk,\
    \ regulation, and compliance\" components address this issue. The former covers\
    \ \ncommunication, education, and training, while the latter addresses risk assessment,\
    \ \ncybersecurity, complaints, breach, and reporting (Wiseman & Sanderson, 2020,\
    \ p. 6).  \nThe code outlines six key principles for agricultural data management,\
    \ including \ngovernance, transparency, privacy, security, accessibility, and\
    \ usability. It provides \nguidelines for responsible data sharing, such as obtaining\
    \ consent from data owners, \nensuring data quality and accuracy, and protecting\
    \ sensitive information. By including \nthese principles and guidelines, the code\
    \ provides a comprehensive framework for the \nmanagement and sharing of agricultural\
    \ data in Australia.  \nWhile the code provides a valuable framework for data\
    \ governance and responsible data \nsharing, it may require significant resources\
    \ and investment to implement effectively. \nAdditionally, there may be challenges\
    \ in ensuring compliance with the code's guidelines, \n \n82 \nparticularly for\
    \ small-scale farmers and other stakeholders who may have limited resources \n\
    or technical capabilities. \n▪ \nThe U.S. Privacy and Security Principles for\
    \ Farm Data \nIn 2014, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), commodity groups,\
    \ farm \norganizations, and ATPs jointly formulated the \"Privacy and Security\
    \ Principles for Farm \nData\"43, also known as the Core Principles, which is\
    \ the most extensive code in the U.S. \nTwo years later, in 2016, AFBF, along\
    \ with other organizations and agribusiness \ncompanies, established the Ag-Data\
    \ Transparency Evaluator Inc44, a non-profit \norganization that developed the\
    \ Ag-Data Transparent logo or seal of approval45. This logo \nrecognizes compliance\
    \ with the Core Principles for agricultural data. However, no \nscholarly literature\
    \ or other documents are available that demonstrate or describe the \nverification\
    \ processes for Core Principles compliance. \nThe goal of the U.S. Core Principles\
    \ is to encourage as many agribusiness and \nagricultural tech companies46 as\
    \ possible to commit47 to including them in their contracts \nand agreements with\
    \ farmers. According to the information available on Ag-Data \n \n43 The Core\
    \ Principles are available at: https://www.agdatatransparent.com/principles \n\
    44 It is a non-profit organization providing the certification process based on\
    \ the Core Principles at a cost \ndepending on the size of the organization, whether\
    \ it is a startup, standard or large. More information \navailable at: https://www.agdatatransparent.com/about\
    \ and at: \nhttps://www.agdatatransparent.com/principles. \n45 An official logo\
    \ acting as a certificate of voluntary commitment to comply with the core principles\
    \ of \nagricultural data practices. \n46 According to the AFBF web page information,\
    \ over 37 organizations –agribusiness technology \nproviders (ATP) contracting\
    \ with farmers– have agreed to follow these Core Principles. \n47 Guarantee to\
    \ incorporate the Core Principles into ag-data contracts mainly based on a sign\
    \ of good \nfaith, since the ag data principles are non-binding guidelines. \n\
    \ \n83 \nTransparent, over 37 organizations (Certified Companies Ag Data Transparent,\
    \ 2022) in \nthe United States have agreed to follow the Core Principles and have\
    \ obtained the Ag Data \nTransparent certification as proof of compliance. This\
    \ certification process is based on the \n13 \"core principles,\" (Core Principles\
    \ Ag Data Transparent, 2022)48 and companies or \nATPs must answer 11 questions49\
    \ about how they collect, use, share, and protect farmers' \nagricultural data.\
    \ These answers are reviewed and approved by an independent third-party \nadministrator\
    \ (Certified Companies Ag Data Transparent, 2022), and when approved, \nADT issues\
    \ the certification seal. \nThe ADT seal or logo serves as an assurance to farmers\
    \ that organizations can be trusted \nto handle their agricultural data in contracts.\
    \ According to Todd Janzen, the ADT \nadministrator, the seal \"is helping provide\
    \ transparency, simplicity, and trust for farmers \nand their tech providers.\"\
    \ While the \"core principles\" for agricultural data are essential, the \ncertification\
    \ process demonstrates how they can be put into practice.  \nThe Core Principles\
    \ require agribusinesses to be open and transparent about their data \ncollection\
    \ and usage practices. Companies are expected to disclose the types of data they\
    \ \ncollect, how it is collected, and how it is used. They are also required to\
    \ be transparent \nabout the third parties with whom they share data and the purposes\
    \ for which they share it. \nIn addition to transparency, the U.S. Core Principles\
    \ emphasize the importance of \nsecurity in agricultural data practices. The principles\
    \ recognize that agricultural data is \nsensitive and valuable information that\
    \ requires protection. The Core Principles require \n \n48 Information available\

    \ \n \n84 \nagribusinesses to implement reasonable security measures to protect\
    \ agricultural data from \nunauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The principles\
    \ also require companies to provide \nfarmers with information about their security\
    \ practices, including how they secure data, \nwhat security measures they have\
    \ in place, and how they respond to security incidents. \nOverall, the U.S. Core\
    \ Principles for Farm Data represent an important step towards \nestablishing\
    \ responsible data practices in the agriculture sector. By emphasizing the \n\
    importance of data control, transparency, and security, the Core Principles provide\
    \ a \nframework for agribusinesses and farmers to work together in a more responsible\
    \ and \ntrustworthy manner. The principles are not legally binding, but they provide\
    \ a valuable set \nof guidelines that can help ensure that agricultural data is\
    \ managed in a responsible and \nethical manner. \nIn summary, the common objective\
    \ of these codes is to create trusting environments and \nrelationships for sharing\
    \ and using agricultural data between farmers, producers, and \nservice, machinery,\
    \ and digital tech agribusiness providers based on contract agreements. \nNonetheless,\
    \ adherence to all agricultural data practices codes is entirely voluntary, as\
    \ they \nare non-binding guidelines for parties who agree to work together based\
    \ on data contracts. \nFigure 16 provides a visual comparison of these codes,\
    \ illustrating the gradual contribution \nof each code to the agricultural data\
    \ practices of the four countries. \n \n85 \nFigure 16 Comparison of existing\
    \ COPs \n \nAdapted from GODAN50 (2022) \nFigure 16 shows an incremental comparison\
    \ of the four COPs analyzed in this section. \nEach of these COPs includes comparable\
    \ guidelines and principles to enhance agricultural \ndata practices in their\
    \ respective countries. The Australian COP, released in 2020, \nintegrates numerous\
    \ definitions and principles from the preceding codes, while also \nemphasizing\
    \ the significance of enhancing capacity and capabilities within the agricultural\
    \ \nsector to effectively collect, manage, and utilize agricultural data. This\
    \ includes providing \ntraining and education to farmers and other stakeholders\
    \ on data collection and analysis \n \n50 GODAN toolkit: “Code of Conduct Constructor”\

    \ as well as investing in the necessary infrastructure and technology to enable\
    \ \neffective data sharing and collaboration. \nCOPs are voluntary and principle-based\
    \ guidelines for the self-regulation of agricultural \ndata practices. While they\
    \ are not legally enforceable, they have the potential to drive \nsignificant\
    \ industry-wide shifts in data practices. These COPs provide foundational \ncomponents\
    \ for governing agricultural data, engaging stakeholders, fostering trust and\
    \ \ntransparency, and creating innovative pathways to extract value from agricultural\
    \ data. \nHowever, there is currently no conclusive evidence that these COPs are\
    \ effective tools for \nsupporting agricultural data practices in any of the countries\
    \ where they are in force.  \nCOPs can be a starting point for policy frameworks,\
    \ as they encourage discussions and \ncollaboration to find solutions that meet\
    \ the needs and interests of all involved parties. The \nGlobal Open Data for\
    \ Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN), the Technical Centre for \nAgriculture and\
    \ Rural Cooperation (CTA), and the Global Forum on Agricultural Research \nand\
    \ Innovation (GFAR) have jointly launched a toolkit that enables stakeholders\
    \ to develop \nand simulate their own agricultural codes of conduct.  \nThe Agricultural\
    \ Codes of Conduct Toolkit is the result of a consultative process \ninvolving\
    \ the GODAN/CTA Sub-Group on Data Codes of Conduct, as part of a planned \nglobal\
    \ collective action on Empowering Farmers through Equitable Data Sharing. The\
    \ \ntoolkit aims to enable stakeholders to better understand the needs and concerns\
    \ of all actors \ninvolved in the agricultural data value chain, thus strengthening\
    \ trust across the industry. \nIt features 17 clauses that users can access and\
    \ select from depending on their relevance. \nWhile these clauses are not exhaustive\
    \ and do not replace a robust institutional framework, \n \n87 \nthey can be useful\
    \ in guiding decision-making and operationalizing ethical practices for \nthe\
    \ flow of agricultural data.  \nThe online platform can play a critical role in\
    \ creating a dialogue among stakeholders \nand finding solutions that address\
    \ the needs and interests of all parties involved. In the \nwords of Andre Laperriere,\
    \ Executive Director of GODAN, “Codes of conduct help \ninclude smallholder farmers\
    \ in decision making, policy design, and enhancement of \nprivacy protection and\
    \ trust, as well as providing considerable economic and health \nbenefits.” \n\
    U.S. Data Cooperatives  \nThere are several companies in the U.S. that offer data\
    \ services and solutions to the \nagriculture sector, including collaborative\
    \ agribusiness models such as data cooperatives51 \nand data pools. Six major\
    \ organizations in the United States serve as intermediaries in \nagricultural\
    \ data management. These organizations include the Ag Data Coalition (ADC), \n\
    the Grower Information Services Cooperative (GiSC), the Farmers Business Network\
    \ \n(FBN), and the most recent federally funded initiative of the United States\
    \ Department of \nAgriculture, the National Agricultural Producers Data Cooperative\

    Organization Description \ninformation source, this network guarantees transparency\
    \ and fairness \nas values when dealing with ag data. \nNAPDC \nIt is defined\
    \ as a project. The overall goal of this project is to develop a \nblueprint for\
    \ a national data framework and cooperative where \nproducers, universities, and\
    \ not-for-profit entities can store and share \ndata and develop powerful tools\
    \ that enable producers to maximize \ntheir production and profitability. The\
    \ NAPDC will develop a \nblueprint for a national agricultural producers’ data\
    \ framework; engage \nand support diverse participation including all types of\
    \ agricultural \nresearch institutions, producers, and representatives of a relevant\
    \ data \nproducer and end-user organizations; and communicate and \ndisseminate\
    \ findings of all activities through publications, peer-\nreviewed articles, and\
    \ presentations to scientific and producer groups. \nThese companies function\
    \ as independent data aggregation platforms that share \nagronomic precision data\
    \ with a common goal of creating a secure system for processing \nagricultural\
    \ data efficiently. They offer centralized locations for managing all agricultural\
    \ \ndata. For instance, GiSC offers the AgHub tool, which collects and securely\
    \ stores all \nagricultural data from digital technologies such as tractors, sprayers,\
    \ sensors, and drones.  \nThese cooperatives emphasize a farmer-first approach\
    \ and claim to be an \"independent, \nunbiased, and objective farmer-driven information\
    \ source,\" as stated on the FBN53 website. \nOthers, like Open Ag Data Alliance,\
    \ create \"a secure data ecosystem that enables data \nsecurity, privacy, and\
    \ interoperability for the entire agriculture industry\"54 through open \nsoftware\
    \ available to farmers. These six data cooperatives mentioned are only examples\

    \ intermediaries are emerging as key \nplayers in the agriculture sector. These\
    \ organizations offer secure and centralized platforms \nto manage agricultural\
    \ data, provide oversight and transparency over the use of data \nentrusted to\
    \ them. Moving forward, the continued growth and success of these data \ncooperatives\
    \ will depend on their ability to maintain trust among all stakeholders, \nparticularly\
    \ farmers, and to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological landscape\
    \ in \nthe agriculture sector. \nU.S. National and State-Level Laws and Regulations\
    \ \nThe policy landscape and legal framework regulating agricultural data governance\
    \ in \nthe United States reveals challenges and uncertainties. Although there\
    \ are regulatory bill \ninitiatives, none of them aim to set industry-specific\
    \ norms for data flow, sharing, privacy, \nand security. Modernization and innovation\
    \ of agricultural data infrastructure at the public \ninstitutional level, such\
    \ as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is still pending. \nThe Agriculture\
    \ Improvement Act (P.L. 115-334), also known as the “2018 Farm bill,” \nwas signed\
    \ into law in December 2018 and will remain in effect until 2023 (McMinimy et\
    \ \nal., 2019). This Act was part of the U.S. Congress's periodic agricultural\
    \ policy revisions \nthat largely extended “agricultural commodity support programs\
    \ along existing lines while \nmodifying them in various ways” (McMinimy et al.,\
    \ 2019, p.1). The major changes focused \non reallocating funding across agriculture\
    \ and food programs. \n \n91 \nThe farm Bill 2018 responds to a periodic regulatory\
    \ revision that addresses a wide \nrange of agricultural and food-related issues;\
    \ for instance, issues related to “agricultural \nconservation, credit, rural\
    \ development, domestic nutrition assistance, trade and \ninternational food aid,\
    \ organic agriculture, forestry…” (McMinimy et al.,2019, p. 1) among \nothers.\
    \ One of the new Farm Bill 2018 provisions is the extension of support for urban\
    \ \nagricultural programs as well as the creation of new and specific authorities\
    \ (Janzen, 2018). \nHowever, the modifications in the law did not address the\
    \ issue of agricultural data \ngovernance, including standards, safeguards and\
    \ enabler mechanisms, or processes to \nmanage it in a way that farmers could\
    \ easily access information they reported themselves \nvia a single platform.\
    \ \nDespite these challenges, the USDA has made progress in recent years. For\
    \ example, \nthe 2014 Farm Bill mandated the Acreage Crop Reporting Streamlining\
    \ Initiative (ACRSI), \naimed at reducing the burden of data submission for farmers\
    \ and preventing duplication of \ndata received in various department programs\
    \ (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 7). ACRSI has \nestablished a standardized framework\
    \ for farmers to report acreage data to the USDA. The \ninstitutional role of\
    \ USDA is to develop and publish reporting standards for the framework \nas part\
    \ of the initiative. \nAccording to Ristino & Hart (2022, p.7), ACRSI data is\
    \ shared electronically and \nsecurely between farmers and relevant program areas.\
    \ ACRSI demonstrates the benefits \nand value of creating data standards that\
    \ facilitate more efficient, secure, and accurate data \nsharing across the USDA\
    \ (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 7). However, the disconnect between \nUSDA agencies\
    \ promotes institutional silos, making the integration, sharing, and use of \n\
    agricultural data even more difficult. \n \n92 \nIn 2018, the USDA established\
    \ a Chief Data Officer (CDO) and assistant Data Officers \nin each mission to\
    \ improve data governance practices within the agency. This institutional \nmodification\
    \ resulted in the creation of the Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset\
    \ \n(EDAPT). EDAPT connects data from 150 sources, both internal and external,\
    \ to provide \na comprehensive collection of administrative data and a standardized\
    \ set of centrally \navailable data analytics tools. The department-wide dashboard\
    \ created a more data-focused \nculture, building technical and leadership capacity\
    \ and inspiring other CDOs to develop \nsimilar platforms within their agencies\
    \ (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 7). \nThe USDA's development of the Data Strategy\
    \ for 2021-2023 represents a recent effort \nto tackle the challenges of governing\
    \ agricultural data within the agency. The Strategy's \nfirst goal is focused\
    \ on Data Governance and Leadership. In line with this, the USDA \nreleased the\
    \ USDA Data Act Governance and POC Charter in 2019. The Act seeks to \nenhance\
    \ data quality within the agency by establishing governance processes, protocols,\
    \ \nroles and responsibilities, and rules for accessing, controlling, and sharing\
    \ data within the \nagency's structural organization. The USDA's growing awareness\
    \ of data issues and its \ncritical institutional role in promoting the benefits\
    \ of effective use of agricultural data \nhighlights the importance of continuing\
    \ efforts to modernize and enhance data governance \nin the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nIn 2018, Senators Amy Klobuchar and John Thune introduced the Agricultural\
    \ Data Act \n(Ag-Data Act, 115th Congress, 2017-2018), a bipartisan bill aimed\
    \ at streamlining the \ncollection and sharing of agricultural data for the benefit\
    \ of U.S. agriculture producers. The \nprimary goal of the bill was to increase\
    \ knowledge about how conservation practices \nimpact farm and ranch profitability\
    \ and soil health by collecting, reviewing, and analyzing \n \n93 \ndata. The\
    \ bill intended to make USDA data available to researchers and land grant \nuniversities\
    \ to encourage the study of conservation practices and their effects on farm \n\
    profitability and soil health (Janzen, 2018a). \nAccording to Janzen (2018a),\
    \ the purpose of this bill is to streamline agricultural data \ncollection within\
    \ the USDA and make it available for research purposes to land grant \nuniversities\
    \ and other organizations. \nAt the state level, Minnesota's legal regulations\
    \ identify the various types of agricultural \ndata in the public sector. However,\
    \ they do not provide a description of the rules, norms, \nor processes to access,\
    \ share, and use such public data. In 2020, Chapter 13 outlined the \nGovernment\
    \ Data practices, and Section 13.643 and 13.6435 specifically deal with \nAgricultural\
    \ Data types. Table 13 below provides a detailed description of the content of\

    \ 4 of Section 13.6435, \"agricultural applications; protection of trade \nsecrets,\"\
    \ is a significant step towards addressing legal issues and disputes related to\
    \ ag data. \nHowever, Ellixson & Griffin (2016, p.2) point out that as of 2016,\
    \ there were no laws \ncovering the ownership of agricultural data or the consequences\
    \ of misusing that data. \n \n95 \nThe agricultural sector's national and public\
    \ data infrastructure is essential for providing \ncritical agricultural insights,\
    \ improving the effectiveness of farm bill programs, and \noffering better value\
    \ to farmers and taxpayers (Ristino & Hart, 2022). To address these \nissues,\
    \ the AGree Initiative, Three Canyon Farms, Data Foundation, University of Missouri\
    \ \nCenter for Regenerative Agriculture, and the Meridian Institute collaborated\
    \ on the \nwebinar, \"Models for Modernizing Agriculture Data Infrastructure:\
    \ Lessons Learned from \nData Innovation in Other Sectors\" on June 9, 2022. They\
    \ discussed the recently published \nreport, \"Modernizing Agriculture Data Infrastructure\
    \ to Improve Economic and Ecological \nOutcomes,\" which outlines four practical\
    \ options for modernizing the USDA's data \ninfrastructure to adapt, innovate,\
    \ and ensure food security in the future (Ristino & Hart, \n2022). Figure 17 illustrates\
    \ these four models. \nFigure 17 Four Models to Modernize the USDA Agricultural\
    \ Data Infrastructure \nAdapted from (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 3) \nThe current\
    \ USDA data infrastructure is struggling to assist farmers in addressing \nchallenges,\
    \ such as the extreme weather events that caused the Midwest floods in 2019, \n\
    disruptions in global supply chains like those experienced in 2021, and the rising\
    \ prices of \nfertilizers (Ristino & Hart, 2022). Adopting one of the four proposed\
    \ models could help \n \n96 \nimprove the low institutional performance of the\
    \ USDA in assisting agriculture digital \ntransformation.  \nA centralized model\
    \ for data infrastructure, operated within the USDA, could provide \nreliable\
    \ data standards and build trustworthy systems for farmers and other stakeholders.\
    \ \nHowever, Ristino and Hart (2022, p. 3) argue that due to the USDA’s limited\
    \ infrastructure \ncapacity and heavy inter-institutional regulations, this model\
    \ may be impractical.  \nThe second model proposes centralizing the data infrastructure\
    \ under a public-private \npartnership. This model combines the appeal of enabling\
    \ government authorities for data \nprotection and resources with the flexibility\
    \ of the private sector, including its ability to \nprotect proprietary information.\
    \  \nA third model involves designing a data linkage hub. Ristino & Hart (2022)\
    \ state that \nongoing discussions are underway to determine the benefits of this\
    \ model. It would provide \na highly secure environment for integrating data with\
    \ some usage restrictions. \nThe final model proposes a contractual approach,\
    \ which is sensitive and requires \ncoordination and negotiations with farmers\
    \ regarding the economic contractual rates \n(Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 14). This\
    \ approach requires clear incentives to compensate \npartners or data providers\
    \ for data exchange and transactions. \nWhile not prescriptive, these four models\
    \ offer potential solutions to the challenges \nfacing the USDA agency's data\
    \ practices. In a webinar featuring speakers such as Robert \nBlair, president\
    \ of Three Canyon Farms, it was noted that farmers have a distrust of data \n\
    reporting and that the USDA is falling behind in terms of data practices in the\
    \ information \nage (Atwood et al., 2022). Blair emphasized the need for the USDA\
    \ to modernize its \n \n97 \ninfrastructure to collect and promote data flow among\
    \ farmers and other USDA agencies. \nAgriculture stakeholders recognize the importance\
    \ of using data to improve food safety \nand security at a macro level. \nThe\
    \ four proposed models for modernizing the USDA's data infrastructure system offer\
    \ \nan opportunity to build trust and collaboration between farmers and other\
    \ stakeholders in \nthe agriculture sector, as well as unlock economic opportunities\
    \ by leveraging data value. \nFor example, better information about farms' productivity\
    \ and risk can help address \ndynamic weather and economic challenges (Ristino\
    \ & Hart, 2022, p. 4) and researchers \ncould use data to understand how different\
    \ farming practices affect productivity and \nenvironmental outcomes, which can\
    \ enable ecosystem markets. \nHowever, while these models address the issue at\
    \ the meso-institutional level, governing \nagricultural data at the macro sector\
    \ level remains a challenge. Private agribusiness firms \nare already using data\
    \ to make production decisions and promote carbon markets, and \nagricultural\
    \ machinery manufacturers are connecting equipment to the cloud for real-time\
    \ \ndata collection. Meanwhile, the USDA's data infrastructure has stalled, hindering\
    \ its ability \nto support farmers and enhance program performance. \nLesson Drawing\
    \ and Benchmarking \nThis section summarizes the main lessons, best practices,\
    \ and benchmarks drawn from \nthe examination of existing regulatory frameworks\
    \ for data governance in the U.S., other \ncountries, other sectors, and Europe.\
    \ Lesson-drawing is a process that requires more than \njust highlighting successful\
    \ examples of current programs or processes addressing similar \n \n98 \nproblems\
    \ elsewhere. As Rose (1991, p. 19) notes, it also requires examination of under\
    \ \nwhat conditions and to what extent a current program or process would work\
    \ elsewhere. \nOne lesson to draw from the codes of practice is the importance\
    \ of agricultural data \ndefinitions. While the U.S. code of practice does not\
    \ explicitly describe the types of data \ncovered by the set of principles, the\
    \ codes from New Zealand and the European Union do \nso to varying degrees. The\
    \ EU COP provides a comprehensive list of definitions that \naccurately describe\
    \ the scope of all three codes55 (van der Burg et al., 2021), including the \n\
    importance of data originators56 having control over their data. \nOne of the\
    \ strengths of codes of practice (COPs) is that they are principle-based and \n\
    reflect what the industry considers good practice in agricultural data management\
    \ \n(Wiseman et al., 2019, p. 11). Instead of prescribing specific processes or\
    \ actions, COPs \nfocus on the desired outcomes of data practices. This approach\
    \ emphasizes consent, \ndisclosure, and transparency in data practices through\
    \ contractual agreements rather than \ndictating how agribusinesses should manage\
    \ their data. \nAnother lesson learned from examining the COPs, is the importance\
    \ of the Australian \nData Rules, which provide an action-oriented program for\
    \ capacity building, training, and \nrisk management. Figure 18 summarizes these\
    \ regulatory lessons drawn from the COPs, \nwhich are concise and relevant to\
    \ the proposed data governance framework. \n \n55 EU code definition of agricultural\
    \ data: “data related to agricultural production, including farm data and \nall\
    \ types of data generated within the farming processes”  \n56 Data originator:\
    \ “the person or entity with the exclusive right to license data access and control\
    \ its \ndownstream use and re-use.” Definition from the EU Code of Conduct (p.6).\
    \ \n \n99 \nFigure 18 Agricultural Data Governance Policy Framework: regulatory\
    \ dimensions and \nattributes to design the policy options \n \nAdapted from Chen,\
    \ 2021 \nFurthermore, benchmarking allows for the comparison and measurement of\
    \ standards \nand strategies that can foster trust and transparency. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley\
    \ Act \n(GLBA)57 is a significant example not only because it established data\
    \ handling standards, \nbut also because it expanded consumer rights. Customers\
    \ now have the right to access their \n“nonpublic personal information (NPI)58”\
    \ at any time, increasing transparency between \nconsumers and financial institutions.\
    \ This increase in transparency has given consumers \n \n57 Gramm-Leach-Bliley\
    \ Act, Pub. L. No. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (1999). \n58 Nonpublic personal information\
    \ refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual and \n\
    is not available to the public. Examples of NPI include a person's name, address,\
    \ social security number, \ncredit card number, and financial account information.\
    \ GLBA requires financial institutions to disclose \ntheir policies for collecting,\
    \ sharing, and protecting NPI, and to give customers the right to opt out of \n\
    having their NPI shared with third parties. \n \n100 \nthe ability to control\
    \ how their data is handled and to opt out of sharing information with \nthird\
    \ parties. \nSimilarly, the U.S. HIPAA59 regulation sets rules and standards governing\
    \ the privacy \nand security of personal health data in the country. By establishing\
    \ compliance and security \nrules, HIPAA ensures a reliable flow of health and\
    \ personal data. For instance, it defines \nthe roles and responsibilities of\
    \ institutions providing healthcare and health insurance \ncompanies to protect\
    \ patients' personal information. \nTo encourage innovation, best practices for\
    \ agricultural data management should \nprioritize implementing data governance\
    \ strategies such as defining roles and \nresponsibilities for decisions involving\
    \ agricultural data, promoting data sharing, building \ntrust in data collection,\
    \ use, and sharing, and ensuring adequate safeguards against the risks \nassociated\
    \ with data misuse. \nIn the US, data cooperatives have emerged to address the\
    \ lack of proper management \nand utilization of the data collected, as well as\
    \ the absence of a standardized comprehensive \nsecurity system for the flow of\
    \ agricultural data. While these cooperatives offer a variety \nof digital solutions,\
    \ an agricultural data governance framework should aim to simplify data \nexchange\
    \ between companies, farmers, and the public sector. It should provide a \ncomprehensive\
    \ solution to the vulnerability of agricultural data to breaches and cyber-\n\
    attacks. \n \n59 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,\
    \ Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 \n(1996). \n \n101 \nPolicy Options Design\
    \ \nThis research proposes three policy alternatives or options60 as potential\
    \ solutions to \naddress the policy problem of agricultural data governance in\
    \ the U.S. A well-designed \npolicy should have clear, specific, and consistent\
    \ goals, with links to the targeted behavior \nof the population, and ultimately\
    \ the desired outcomes (Schneider, 1997, p. 35). The policy \nalternatives proposed\
    \ in this research are tailored to the data governance pillars, which \ninclude\
    \ safeguards and enablers, as per the legal data governance framework presented\
    \ by \nWDR21 (World Bank, 2021), that encompass various types of data and stakeholders.\
    \ \nFigure 19 illustrates the policy design components considered in the formulation\
    \ of the \npolicy alternatives. \nFigure 19 Components of Policy Design \n \n\
    Adapted from (Schneider, 1997) \nTools and rules are procedural aspects of policy\
    \ design that specify who is responsible \nfor what, where, and when (Schneider,\
    \ 1997, p. 97) in order to achieve certain benefits, \nsuch as capacity-building\
    \ or providing incentives for action. Rationales and assumptions \nare explanations\
    \ or reasons for the design decisions made, such as the choice of target \npopulation,\
    \ tools, rules, and goals (Schneider, 1997, p. 99). The rationale connects the\

    \ that produces specific consequences \nor effects (Stone, 2012, p. 225). The\
    \ policy alternatives were developed based on a comparative analysis of \nexisting\
    \ data governance frameworks described in this chapter. \n \n102 \npolicy elements\
    \ to the context, making explicit claims that the design is responsive to the\
    \ \nproblem and will have a positive impact. Assumptions are the underlying logic\
    \ that \nconnects the selected elements together. Policy goals and problems to\
    \ be solved are \nintentional aspects of policy design. These are expressed in\
    \ objective and technical terms, \nbut they represent desired outcomes. They can\
    \ be broadly defined and framed in terms of \npublic interest or narrowly defined\
    \ and framed to affect only specific groups (Schneider, \n1997). \nDesigning a\
    \ data governance policy framework involves establishing guidance norms \nand\
    \ rules, data quality standards, defining roles and responsibilities for compliance\
    \ and \nsecurity, and promoting capacity building, particularly among farmers.\
    \ The overall \nobjective is to develop a policy that governs the flow of agricultural\
    \ data while promoting \ntrust and transparency among all stakeholders. \nAn agricultural\
    \ data policy should be drafted as \"principle-based and technologically \nneutral\
    \ laws and regulations... [to] help them remain relevant as technologies evolve\
    \ and \nreduce compliance burdens” (World Bank, 2021, p. 191), which means creating\
    \ an \nadaptable policy. A data governance policy framework requires government\
    \ agencies in \nthe agriculture sector to act not only as regulators but also\
    \ as investors in good data \npractices that can generate value from agricultural\
    \ data. \nAn expert judgement from the international institution, OECD, and its\
    \ report \"Digital \nOpportunities for Better Agricultural Policies\" (OECD, 2019),\
    \ states that governments \nshould take the lead in improving access to agricultural\
    \ data. One key role of the \ngovernment in micro/farm level agricultural data\
    \ is to enable the ability to link datasets \n \n103 \nwhile preserving confidentiality\
    \ as necessary (Sanderson et al., 2018). The \nrecommendations of OECD (2019)\
    \ have been synthesized in Table 14. \nTable 14 Government role and what they\
    \ should do \nPublic \norganizations/institutions \nFunctions/roles (what needs\

    \ of data \nquality for data from alternative sources and \nplanning. \nAdapted\
    \ from OECD (2019) “Digital Opportunities for Better Agricultural Policies” \n\
    The data governance framework includes safeguards to protect personal data and\
    \ \nbalance the interests of data reuse and non-personal data. Enablers promote\
    \ mechanisms \nfor data sharing and incentivize both the public and private sector\
    \ to use and reuse data. \nThe framework also defines roles and responsibilities\
    \ for creating an environment that \nfosters education on digital technologies\
    \ and their implementation. The intended outcome \nis to create robust and adaptable\
    \ data governance regulations that include safeguards to \nprevent the misuse\
    \ of data, as well as enablers that facilitate access to and use of data. \nFigure\
    \ 20 captures the components of the data governance framework for each policy\
    \ \noption in this research. In order to integrate the role of institutions, the\
    \ \"roles and \nresponsibilities\" pillar is an additional component of each policy\
    \ option data governance \nframework. Outcomes are added to the policy options\
    \ design to serve as an analysis \ncriterion for each of them. \n \n105 \nFigure\
    \ 20 Components of policy design for agricultural data governance policy options\
    \ \n \nSafeguards are an essential component of a data governance policy framework,\
    \ as they \nprovide mechanisms and processes to create a secure environment for\
    \ accessing and using \npersonal and non-personal data. They support individuals'\
    \ agency to control their data, \nensuring their data rights to give consent to\
    \ the use of personal data (World Bank, 2021, p. \n191), such as farmers' addresses\
    \ and identification numbers, or third-party access to non-\npersonal data, such\
    \ as crop production. The goal of these norms is to ensure data security \nand\
    \ promote trustworthiness. \nThe inclusion of safeguards in the policy options\
    \ design is crucial due to the concern of \npower asymmetries arising from a data\
    \ control approach, rather than a data ownership \nperspective. Therefore, safeguards\
    \ are established in the form of substantive rights, such \nas preventing unauthorized\
    \ disclosure or unfair use of personal and non-personal data, and \nprocedural\
    \ rights that promote transparency and accountability, such as the right to receive\
    \ \nnotice, object to data usage, and access, correct, or erase data (World Bank,\
    \ 2021, p. 194). \n \n106 \nEnabling norms and rules for the good practice of\
    \ data use and reuse are a fundamental \npillar of a data governance framework.\
    \ Enablers are primarily analyzed based on the \ndomain of the data, i.e., whether\
    \ the data are generated or controlled by the public or private \nsector, or both\
    \ (World Bank, 2021, p. 199). \nInstitutions play a critical role in implementing\
    \ regulations. They have distinct values, \nnorms, and operating procedures that\
    \ define their culture (Schneider, 1997, p. 76). The \nUSDA is the federal agency\
    \ responsible for the agriculture sector, and it has the potential \nto modernize\
    \ its structure to support sector data governance and promote a data-driven \n\
    culture within the sector. \nIncorporating justice as a central standard in policy\
    \ design can create an institutional \ndata-driven and digital technology culture\
    \ that serves the interests and principles of \ndistributive justice (Schneider,\
    \ 1997, p. 64). To achieve desired outcomes, policy design \nshould target specific\
    \ populations (Schneider, 1997, p. 35). The goal of an agricultural data \ngovernance\
    \ policy framework is to create strong and resilient policy options that can adapt\
    \ \nto the rapid and ongoing evolution of IR 4.0 technologies such as AI, IoT,\
    \ and ICTs. Such \na framework should also be able to deal with multi-stakeholder\
    \ conflicts over the medium-\nto-long term (Howlett, 2019, p. 28). \nTo achieve\
    \ both robustness and resilience in policy design, Howlett (2019, p. 30) \nsuggests\
    \ the need to design and adopt policies that feature agility and flexibility in\
    \ their \ncomponents and processes. Therefore, institutions' role in policy design\
    \ is to determine the \nnecessary robustness and resilience to respond to the\
    \ need for a mutually influencing co-\nevolution of technology and regulatory\
    \ frameworks. \n \n107 \nAfter considering all these factors in proposing an agricultural\
    \ data governance \nframework, this research presents three policy options: minimalist,\
    \ moderate, and \nmaximalist. Table 15 summarizes these three policy alternatives,\
    \ including the rules, \nnorms, degree of intervention by institutions, goals,\
    \ the expected problems to be solved, \nand desired outcomes. \nTable 15 Three\

    \ \nRedistributive \n(ideological \nand class \nconflict) \nAdapted from Stone\
    \ (2012) and Birkland (2011) \nThese three policy options represent three policy\
    \ levels. The first level, the minimalist \npolicy option, it is a data governance\
    \ solution that emerge from the COPs created by the \nagriculture sector farm-led\
    \ associations. A second level, the moderate policy option, it is a \ndata governance\
    \ solution that sets out rules for all private and public parties to follow \n\
    regarding data use. And finally, a third level, a maximalist policy option, it\
    \ is a data \ngovernance solution integrating data governance level 1 and 2 and\
    \ considering the rights \non and of data at the national level, i.e., a data\
    \ governance act for agricultural data. \n▪ \nOption 1: Minimalist \nThe purpose\
    \ of the minimalist policy approach is to address the issue of mistrust in \n\
    current agricultural data practices through contractual agreements between farmers\
    \ and \nproviders. This option is minimal in its scope as it aims to transform\
    \ the voluntary nature \nof the U.S. Code of Practice (COP) and involve agriculture\
    \ institutions and agencies in \n \n109 \nimplementing processes and mechanisms\
    \ to oversee and evaluate Agriculture Tech \nProviders (ATPs) and other agribusinesses\
    \ that carry a data transparent logo. The goal is \nto ensure that ATPs adhere\
    \ to ethical data practices and provide transparency in their data \nsharing agreements\
    \ with farmers. \nIntended goal: to shift the agricultural sector's mindset towards\
    \ agricultural data \ngovernance, grounded in the U.S. core principles for data\
    \ practices. \nThe goal of the minimalist policy approach is to shift the agricultural\
    \ sector's mindset \ntowards agricultural data governance by transforming the\
    \ voluntary self-regulated set of \nguidelines and principles in the U.S. COP\
    \ into a legal normative data framework that \ngoverns decision-making on agricultural\
    \ data sharing. Government agriculture agencies \nwould play an intervening role\
    \ in supervising the process for obtaining a data transparent \nlogo, seal, or\
    \ trademark and establishing a standardized agreement model specific to the \n\
    agricultural sector in the U.S. In essence, the goal is to achieve a more meaningful\
    \ model \nof consent for using and reusing agricultural data between the private\
    \ and public sectors \nand farmers in the modern digital age. \nEnabling trustworthy\
    \ data operations is crucial for promoting transparent agricultural \ndata practices\
    \ based on the U.S. Code of Practice and the Core Principles. \nThis requires\
    \ implementing technical and organizational measures to ensure data \nintegrity,\
    \ security, and privacy, such as data encryption, access controls, and audit trails.\
    \ \nMoreover, it involves fostering a culture of transparency and accountability\
    \ in data \noperations, which includes informing data subjects about data collection\
    \ and processing \nactivities, obtaining their consent when necessary, and providing\
    \ them with access to their \ndata and the means to correct or delete it. By enabling\
    \ such data operations, the agricultural \n \n110 \nsector can enhance trust among\
    \ stakeholders and promote the responsible use and reuse of \nagricultural data.\
    \ \nA good starting point is to make the U.S. COP's \"core principles\" legally\
    \ binding, as \nthey have been defined and agreed upon by farmers61 to improve\
    \ agricultural data \ngovernance practices. These core principles set rules and\
    \ standards for data sharing, use, \nand reuse, and can help determine the roles\
    \ and responsibilities of the USDA and its \nsubagencies, as well as establish\
    \ a standardized classification of agricultural data types for \nuse in contractual\
    \ agreements. To encourage compliance, the USDA can supervise the \nprocess of\
    \ obtaining a trademark or logo from ATPs and agri-businesses committed to \n\
    promoting transparent data practices. Regulations and institutional interventions\
    \ can also \nhelp foster trust and encourage compliance behaviors, as unified\
    \ data classification is a key \nenabler of data reuse (World Bank, 2021, p. 202).\
    \ \nEnablers to data interoperability & integration for making attractive incentives\
    \ for \npublic and private intent data sharing  \nData interoperability and integration\
    \ can enable the seamless exchange of data between \ndifferent systems, applications,\
    \ and stakeholders in the agricultural sector. This can be \nachieved by adopting\
    \ standard data formats, APIs, and protocols for data sharing, use, and \nreuse.\
    \ Several enablers can promote data interoperability and integration: \n- \nOpen\
    \ data standards: Open data standards can enable data to be shared and \nintegrated\
    \ across different platforms, applications, and stakeholders. Standards \n \n\
    61 Farmers who are part of or participate through the American Farm Bureau Federation\
    \ (AFBF) \n \n111 \nsuch as the AgGateway ADAPT framework can facilitate interoperability\
    \ among \nprecision agriculture devices and software systems. \n- \nIncentives\
    \ for data sharing: Public and private sector actors can be incentivized to \n\
    share and integrate data through financial, social, and technical means. For \n\
    instance, government subsidies, tax credits, or grants can encourage data sharing\
    \ \namong farmers, while social recognition, reputation, or peer pressure can\
    \ motivate \nprivate sector actors to share data. \n- \nData intermediaries: Data\
    \ intermediaries can act as trusted third parties to \nfacilitate data sharing\
    \ and integration among different stakeholders. \nIntermediaries such as farm\
    \ management software providers or agricultural \ncooperatives can aggregate and\
    \ harmonize data from different sources, ensuring \ndata quality, security, and\
    \ privacy. \n- \nData analytics: Advanced analytics tools such as AI, machine\
    \ learning, and \npredictive modeling can help integrate and derive insights from\
    \ disparate data \nsources, enabling better decision-making and value creation\
    \ for all stakeholders \ninvolved. \nThe overall goal of a data governance framework\
    \ in the agriculture sector is to \nincentivize trustworthy mechanisms for data\
    \ sharing, both public and private. In addition \nto legally recognizing core\
    \ principles, agriculture agencies need to modernize and create \ngovernment data\
    \ exchange platforms to ensure data interoperability. This will create \nopportunities\
    \ to open certain types of public intent data for exchange and create incentives\
    \ \nwhile removing barriers to voluntary data sharing involving private sector\
    \ actors such as \nATPs and data cooperatives. The value of agricultural data\
    \ can benefit multiple \n \n112 \nstakeholders, and guidelines or standard contractual\
    \ provisions should be formulated to \ngovern the fairness of terms of use. \n\
    Roles and responsibilities for data quality and compliance for shaping the agriculture\
    \ \ndata economy to continue in the path of the digital transformation \nTo ensure\
    \ the development of a thriving agricultural data economy, roles and \nresponsibilities\
    \ for data quality and compliance must be clearly defined and implemented. \n\
    This requires a concerted effort from both the public and private sectors. Government\
    \ \nagencies, such as the USDA, can play a key role in developing and enforcing\
    \ data \nstandards. This includes establishing mechanisms to monitor and ensure\
    \ compliance with \nthe current U.S. COP62 principles and guidelines. \nPrivate\
    \ sector entities, such as ATPs and data cooperatives, have a responsibility to\
    \ \nuphold these standards and ensure that the data they collect and share is\
    \ of high quality and \nmeets established guidelines. This includes implementing\
    \ data quality control measures, \nsuch as data validation and verification processes,\
    \ to ensure that the data is accurate and \nreliable. \nTo increase transparency\
    \ and trust between farmers, ATPs, and other third parties, a \nmodel of adaptable\
    \ contractual agreements overseen by agriculture agencies should be \ndeveloped.\
    \ Rules are necessary to enforce compliance with contractual agreements, and \n\
    public agencies can assist in policing and enforcing them effectively. One of\
    \ the specific \nroles of these institutions could be to monitor and evaluate\
    \ trademark usage and provide \n \n62 The goal of legally and bindingly regulating\
    \ the current U.S. COP is to reduce the \"digital divide\" \nbetween those who\
    \ have knowledge (i.e., ag. tech service providers) and those who do not, through\
    \ the \nimplementation of transparent and fair data sharing practices. \n \n113\
    \ \ncontinuous feedback loops to promote sector engagement, learning, and improvement.\
    \ It is \nessential to set roles and responsibilities within agriculture agencies\
    \ at the federal and state \nlevels to govern data governance in the U.S. effectively.\
    \ Overall, clear roles and \nresponsibilities are essential for shaping the agriculture\
    \ data economy in a way that fosters \ninnovation, growth, and sustainability.\
    \ \n▪ \nOption 2: Moderate \nA moderate policy option aims to address the agricultural\
    \ data governance problem in \nthe U.S. by proposing the development of trustworthy\
    \ systems. This involves not only \noverseeing the COP and evaluating ATPs and\
    \ agri-businesses carrying a data transparent \nlogo but also creating public\
    \ institutional capacity to introduce safeguards and enablers that \nensure data\
    \ rights and facilitate cross-border sector data sharing, while also ensuring\
    \ \ncompliance with regulatory requirements. \nIntended goal: To create a data\
    \ governance trustworthy and transparent environment \nby regulating agricultural\
    \ data rights and obligations of parties involved in data \npractices and transactions\
    \ \nThe intended goal of a moderate policy option is to establish a transparent\
    \ and \ntrustworthy data governance system for the agricultural sector by defining\
    \ the data security \nresponsibilities of parties involved in transactions through\
    \ contractual agreements. The \nUSDA should have an effective and independent\
    \ role in ensuring data security, including \nregistering data intermediary companies.\
    \ Data intermediaries can facilitate safe data \nsharing and use, promoting equitable\
    \ access to data and its value (World Bank, 2021, p. \n265). The agency can monitor\
    \ the implementation of data rights, including privacy and \n \n114 \nsecurity,\
    \ and handle complaints about legal violations. This role could increase trust\
    \ in data \npractices among agricultural stakeholders.  \nSafeguards for appropriated\
    \ data security conditions for cross-sector border exchange \nof agricultural\
    \ data  \nAppropriate data security conditions are essential for promoting cross-border\
    \ exchange \nof agricultural data. One of the safeguards that can be established\
    \ are agricultural-specific \ndata privacy and security rules and regulations.\
    \ The USDA could work with stakeholders \nto develop such rules and regulations\
    \ that take into account the unique aspects of \nagricultural data, such as farm\
    \ location and practices, and ensure that data is handled \nappropriately. \n\
    Furthermore, the USDA could require data intermediaries and ATPs to undergo regular\
    \ \nsecurity audits and assessments to ensure that they are complying with data\
    \ security \nregulations and standards. The agency could also establish penalties\
    \ for non-compliance to \ndeter ATPs and intermediaries from engaging in risky\
    \ data practices. \nIn addition, the USDA could promote the use of data encryption\
    \ and other security \nmeasures to protect data during transmission and storage.\
    \ This could be accomplished \nthrough the creation of guidelines and recommendations\
    \ for farmers and other stakeholders \non how to securely transmit and store agricultural\
    \ data. \nTo promote cross-border data exchange, it is important to consider the\
    \ impact on the \ncountry's competitiveness and international trade opportunities.\
    \ In order to ensure \nappropriate data security conditions for cross-sector data\
    \ flows, it may be necessary to \nadopt provisions criminalizing unauthorized\
    \ or illegal access to infrastructure, systems, and \n \n115 \ndata. Government\
    \ agencies in the agriculture sector should also consider implementing \nregulatory\
    \ approaches that ensure adequacy and accountability, including specific \nconditions\
    \ that permit data transfer, mutual agreements, and schemes to require, permit,\
    \ or \nlimit cross-border data transfers. \nATPs and other third parties providing\
    \ services cannot engage in data exchange without \na trustworthy system or environment.\
    \ Trust in the data sharing system depends on people's \nconfidence that others\
    \ will follow the rules and agreements, and that there is an authority \nenforcing\
    \ those rules and agreements. In the agriculture sector, in order to build trust\
    \ in the \ndata sharing system, privacy and security should be guaranteed, as\
    \ well as benefits for all \nparties involved. \nEnabling data operations for\
    \ data cooperatives and data integration for an \nAgricultural Data Governance\
    \ and Accreditation Board (a data governance body) \nTo enable data operations\
    \ for data cooperatives, it is necessary to establish data \ngovernance and accreditation\
    \ boards that can provide guidance on data management \npractices, promote interoperability,\
    \ and foster data sharing within the agricultural sector. \nSuch boards can also\
    \ provide technical and policy support to data cooperatives, helping \nthem to\
    \ develop and maintain data management systems that are consistent with industry\
    \ \nstandards and best practices. \nThe integration of data from various sources\
    \ is essential for achieving the full potential \nof data cooperatives. Data integration\
    \ involves the process of combining data from \ndifferent sources to create a\
    \ unified view of the data. This can be done using a variety of \ntools and techniques,\
    \ including data warehousing, data mining, and data modeling. \n \n116 \nAn Agricultural\
    \ Data Governance and Accreditation Board can help facilitate data \nintegration\
    \ by establishing data standards, providing guidance on data quality, and \npromoting\
    \ best practices for data management. The board can also serve as a central point\
    \ \nof contact for data sharing and collaboration among stakeholders in the agricultural\
    \ sector. \nA data governance board could be created or organized within the USDA\
    \ federal \nagency. This board would function as a steering committee, responsible\
    \ for overseeing the \ncollection, transfer, storage, and analysis of agricultural\
    \ data. ATPs, data intermediary \ncompanies, and data cooperatives would be required\
    \ to register with the board and \ncontribute to generating knowledge and advice,\
    \ as well as providing a feedback loop to \nfarmers and policymakers. This would\
    \ ensure that the board has a broad perspective on the \nindustry and can make\
    \ informed decisions about data governance. Additionally, the board \nwould be\
    \ responsible for establishing and enforcing standards for data quality, security,\
    \ \nand privacy. It would also be tasked with developing guidelines for data sharing\
    \ \nagreements and monitoring compliance with those agreements. This would create\
    \ a more \ncohesive and trustworthy data ecosystem for the agriculture sector,\
    \ increasing transparency \nand promoting collaboration between stakeholders.\
    \  \nTo ensure that private sector stakeholders act in the best interests of data\
    \ originators \nsuch as farmers and producers, the USDA Data Governance and Accreditation\
    \ Board could \nprovide guidance and oversight. These stakeholders could advise\
    \ data originators on the \npossible uses of their data and the terms and conditions\
    \ for such uses. Additionally, USDA \nagencies and data intermediary organizations\
    \ could collaborate to build capacity on data \ngovernance issues and provide\
    \ training on the importance of agricultural data and its \n \n117 \npotential\
    \ economic impact. An open-share data platform could also be developed to \nfacilitate\
    \ data sharing and collaboration between stakeholders in the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nOverall, the establishment of data governance and accreditation boards can\
    \ help ensure \nthat data cooperatives operate in a trustworthy and transparent\
    \ environment, with clear \nrules and responsibilities for data management and\
    \ sharing. This, in turn, can promote \ninnovation, facilitate data-driven decision-making,\
    \ and drive growth in the agricultural \nsector. \nRoles and responsibilities\
    \ of government agencies in strengthening technical data \ncapacity, communications,\
    \ and compliance as well as data literacy, to enable e-\ncommunication and e-transactions\
    \ \nThe government agencies have a critical role in strengthening technical data\
    \ capacity \nand data literacy to facilitate e-communication and e-transactions\
    \ in the agriculture sector. \nThis includes providing technical assistance to\
    \ farmers, ATPs, and other stakeholders in \nimplementing data governance best\
    \ practices, such as secure data sharing and compliance \nwith data privacy regulations.\
    \ \nThe government agencies also need to strengthen their own technical capacity\
    \ to oversee \nand enforce data governance policies and regulations. This can\
    \ involve the development of \nnew technologies or systems for monitoring and\
    \ auditing data practices, as well as the \nrecruitment of skilled personnel to\
    \ oversee data governance operations. \nIn addition, the government agencies should\
    \ play a role in promoting communication \nand collaboration among stakeholders\
    \ in the agriculture sector. This includes facilitating \n \n118 \nthe exchange\
    \ of best practices and promoting the adoption of data governance standards \n\
    across different sectors and regions. \nThe role of an agricultural data governance\
    \ and accreditation board is to evaluate and \naccredit ATPs and companies based\
    \ on their compliance with the core principles of the \nU.S. COP. In addition,\
    \ the board will establish a fee schedule for accreditations and \nrenewals and\
    \ will receive a complete checklist from organizations seeking accreditation.\
    \ \nFurthermore, the board will receive and address complaints from farmers and\
    \ primary \nproducers, as well as complying organizations, and will review all\
    \ cases of noncompliance \nand recommend corrective action. To sum up, the roles\
    \ and responsibilities of government \nagencies in improving technical data capacity,\
    \ communications, and compliance are \ncritical for ensuring the safe, secure,\
    \ and responsible use of agricultural data. \nThis moderate policy option aims\
    \ to promote a multi-stakeholder, purpose-driven \napproach to data management\
    \ and governance. The goal is to enable institutions to adapt \nto the rapidly\
    \ evolving digital data ecosystem while enhancing their legitimacy, \ntransparency,\
    \ and accountability. \n▪ \nOption 3: Maximalist \nThe maximalist policy option\
    \ seeks to fully embrace digitization in agriculture by \nestablishing a comprehensive\
    \ regulatory framework for data security, integration, and \ninteroperability.\
    \ This would involve developing national data governance standards, \nestablishing\
    \ clear rules and guidelines for data sharing, and incentivizing compliance with\
    \ \nthese rules through various means, such as tax breaks and subsidies. The goal\
    \ of this policy \n \n119 \noption is to create a secure and dynamic digital economy\
    \ that facilitates agricultural data \naccess, sharing, use, and re-use while\
    \ protecting data privacy and security. \nIntended goal: Integrate agricultural\
    \ data rights governing sharing and ownership, as \nwell as privacy and security\
    \ rights, while regulating data intermediaries and creating \nincentives for reusing\
    \ public administrative agricultural data. \nA comprehensive data governance framework\
    \ must be established to integrate \nagricultural data rights governing sharing\
    \ and ownership, as well as privacy and security \nrights, while regulating data\
    \ intermediaries and creating incentives for reusing public \nadministrative agricultural\
    \ data. This framework should include the following components: \n- \nClear definitions\
    \ of data rights, including ownership, control, and sharing rights, \nas well\
    \ as privacy and security rights. \n- \nRegulations for data intermediaries, including\
    \ data cooperatives and ATPs, that \nensure compliance with data privacy and security\
    \ regulations and that protect \nfarmers' and producers' data rights. \n- \nIncentives\
    \ for reusing public administrative agricultural data to increase the \nefficiency\
    \ and effectiveness of agricultural practices. \n- \nA mechanism for resolving\
    \ disputes related to data ownership and access, \nincluding the creation of a\
    \ data governance body that oversees the implementation \nof data governance policies\
    \ and ensures compliance. \n \n120 \nCreating an institutional environment as\
    \ a foundation for an ecosystem hub63 for \nagricultural data sharing involves\
    \ bringing together all relevant stakeholders and \nestablishing clear rules and\
    \ regulations governing agricultural data practices. This may \ninclude creating\
    \ incentives for data sharing, establishing data privacy and security \nprotocols,\
    \ and setting up a governance framework for data intermediaries. The ecosystem\
    \ \nhub can serve as a central point for sharing data and knowledge, facilitating\
    \ collaboration, \nand fostering innovation in the agricultural sector. By promoting\
    \ greater transparency and \naccountability, the ecosystem hub can help build\
    \ trust among stakeholders and encourage \ngreater participation in data sharing\
    \ efforts. \nAgricultural data governance framework based on data rights could\
    \ indeed provide a \nlegal framework that protects data originators' rights and\
    \ promotes trust in data sharing. \nThis can increase the amount of data made\
    \ available for re-use and encourage data altruism \nacross the agriculture sector\
    \ in the U.S. A robust data governance framework can also \nfoster institutional\
    \ intermediation services, promoting sustainable data-based economic \ntransactions\
    \ benefiting the agriculture sector.  \nIn general, the goal of this approach\
    \ is to ensure that all stakeholders in the agricultural \nsector are protected\
    \ by a robust data governance framework that promotes transparency, \naccountability,\
    \ and trust in the data sharing process. \nSafeguards for data security for agricultural\
    \ data as non-personal data and data \noriginators' data rights protection \n\
    \ \n63 Ecosystem Hub is defined as a network of institutions or organizations\
    \ providing services, and more \nimportantly, maintaining overall connectivity\
    \ as hubs to improve elder care services. \n \n121 \nTo ensure data security and\
    \ protect data originators' data rights in the agriculture sector, \nthe following\
    \ safeguards can be put in place: \n- \nData anonymization and aggregation: non-personal\
    \ data in agriculture can be \nmade anonymous by aggregating data into statistical\
    \ models. This ensures that \ndata is not associated with any individual, and\
    \ thus, privacy is protected. \n- \nData access controls: Access to sensitive\
    \ data should be restricted to only \nauthorized individuals, organizations, and\
    \ data intermediaries. This can be done \nthrough password protection, data encryption,\
    \ or other access control \nmechanisms. \n- \nRegular security audits: Regular\
    \ security audits can be conducted to ensure that \ndata is secure and that data\
    \ originators' data rights are being protected. This can \nhelp identify any potential\
    \ vulnerabilities or breaches in the data system and allow \nfor prompt action\
    \ to be taken to address them. \nThe regulatory environment should strike a balance\
    \ between protecting data originators' \nrights and incentivizing innovation and\
    \ data sharing in the agriculture sector. By providing \nnecessary protections\
    \ for data security and privacy, and establishing backup and recovery \nsystems,\
    \ farmers and primary producers can feel more confident in participating in data\
    \ \nsharing and economic activities without fear of exploitation. \nEnablers to\
    \ increase data integration, interoperability, and operations to access \ninformation\
    \ and to create incentives by removing barriers to voluntary data sharing \nand\
    \ facilitate a smart digital agriculture in the U.S. \n \n122 \nEnabling data\
    \ integration, interoperability, and operations, and creating incentives \nrequires\
    \ the removal of barriers to voluntary data sharing and the facilitation of a\
    \ smart \ndigital agriculture ecosystem in the U.S. This can be achieved by investing\
    \ in modern \ninfrastructure, promoting the adoption of common data standards\
    \ and protocols, fostering \nthe development of data intermediaries and data cooperatives,\
    \ and promoting transparency \nand trust in data sharing among stakeholders. In\
    \ addition, creating incentives, such as \nproviding tax credits or funding opportunities,\
    \ can encourage voluntary data sharing and \nthe adoption of digital technologies,\
    \ which can lead to more efficient and sustainable \nagriculture practices. \n\
    Rights to/on Data as a force for public good \nData is a non-rivalrous good, meaning\
    \ its use by one party does not diminish its use by \nanother. To ensure fair\
    \ use of agricultural data, organizations holding the ADT logo \naccreditation\
    \ and following the U.S. COP \"core principles\" should inform farmers and \n\
    primary producers about the rights they assert in relation to the data, as well\
    \ as the rights \nthe producers have regarding the data. It is also essential\
    \ to disclose the terms under which \nagricultural data is made available to authorized\
    \ third parties or those acting on behalf of \nthe primary producers. \nThe concept\
    \ of data rights as a force for public good refers to the idea that data, \nespecially\
    \ agricultural data, should be viewed as a valuable resource that can benefit\
    \ \nsociety as a whole. This means that data originators (i.e., farmers and primary\
    \ producers) \nshould have the right to control how their data is collected, used,\
    \ and shared, and that the \npublic should have access to certain categories of\
    \ data that can be used to improve \nagricultural practices, support research,\
    \ and inform public policy. By recognizing data as a \n \n123 \npublic good, institutions\
    \ and agencies in the agriculture sector can create a regulatory \nenvironment\
    \ that encourages data sharing and innovation while also protecting data privacy\
    \ \nand security. Ultimately, this approach can help to promote sustainable agriculture\
    \ and \neconomic growth while ensuring that data is used for the greater good\
    \ of society. \nCreating a data governance framework entail putting regulations,\
    \ procedures, and norms \nin place at the macro institutional level. According\

    \ These are additional components \nincluded in this research's data governance\

    \ specify and define the types of data, such as public and private \nintent agricultural\
    \ data, that can be shared, used, and reused. \n \n \n126 \nChapter 4: Policy\
    \ Proposal \nThe objective of this chapter is to use methods of policy forecasting\
    \ to generate a policy \nproposal from the three options presented in Chapter\
    \ 3. These methods will be used to \ndetermine which of the three policy models,\
    \ either individually or in combination, is most \nlikely to advance the goals\
    \ of agricultural data governance, and whether any of them should \nbe rejected\
    \ based on their predicted effects. The results will be used in the Conclusion\
    \ to \nsuggest next steps and further research needs. \nForecasting in policy\
    \ analysis refers to a “set of procedures for creating information \nabout future\
    \ states of society based on present or prior information” (Dunn, 2018, p. 119)\
    \ \nrelated to a particular policy issue or problem. The goal is to generate information\
    \ about \nfuture societal states regarding a specific policy issue based on present\
    \ information. Table \n17 presents a description of the forecasting methods that\

    \ \nAdapted from Dunn, 2018 \nThis research uses projection, prediction, and expert\
    \ judgment (or conjecture) as \nforecasting methods to estimate the potential\
    \ outcomes of the three policy options for \nagricultural data governance. These\
    \ methods aim to provide insight into the expected or \nestimated policy outcomes\
    \ of a framework for agricultural data governance. \nAs stated in the beginning\
    \ of this project, the policy output of agricultural data \ngovernance is the\
    \ production and sharing of high-quality data, and the resulting outcome \nis\
    \ a cost-effective digitization of the agricultural sector. The ultimate objective\
    \ is to \nestablish a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable\
    \ agricultural sector. As \n \n128 \nthis research assumes a direct connection\
    \ from outputs to outcome to impact, the policy \nforecasting here is limited\
    \ to outputs. \nIn the case of the agricultural data problem in the U.S., forecasting\
    \ policy options can \nlead to the development of an agricultural data governance\
    \ framework that meets the \nexpectations of all stakeholders while improving\
    \ efficiency and sustainability in \nagriculture. By forecasting the contents\
    \ of the three new policy options, this research aims \nto determine the most\
    \ plausible option for the future of the agriculture sector in the U.S. \nFigure\
    \ 21 illustrates the structure of the forecasting process. \nFigure 21 Forecasting\
    \ process structure \n \nProjection \nDue to the lack of a comprehensive national\
    \ inventory of data governance regulatory \npractices in the U.S., early projections\
    \ of the three policy options proposed in this study \nare challenging. However,\
    \ the current and rapid development of what scholars refer to as \n \n129 \nthe\
    \ \"data economy\" (Chen, 2021, p. 29) justifies the need for flexible policies\
    \ that can \nfacilitate the growth of various data-driven products, services,\
    \ and business models. \nCOPs represent an initial sector-specific effort to address\
    \ emerging concerns \nsurrounding agricultural data practices. In the U.S., the\
    \ COPs, also known as \"core \nprinciples,\" have been adopted by large farmer-led\
    \ organizations and associations such as \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation\
    \ (AFBF). However, only 37 agriculture tech \nproviders64 have undergone the certification\
    \ process of the Ag Data Transparent Evaluator \n(ADT) and agreed to incorporate\
    \ the \"core principles\" into their contracts and agreements \nwith farmers (Janzen,\
    \ 202165). \nThis COP or \"core principles\" in the U.S. represent a mid-stream,\
    \ non-binding form of \nagricultural data regulation due to the voluntary commitment\
    \ of agriculture tech providers \nto data transparency with farmers and the lack\
    \ of an assessment or evaluation process for \ntheir compliance.  \nA minimal\
    \ policy option for agricultural data governance provides the minimal enablers\
    \ \nfor data sharing, compelling agriculture tech providers to adhere to the \"\
    core principles\" \nwhen collecting, storing, and transferring farmers' agricultural\
    \ data. In this minimalist \npolicy option, state agriculture public entities\
    \ such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nhave a minimal role contribution.\
    \ This agency serves as an enabler in verifying compliance \nwith the \"core principles\"\
    \ and auditing companies with the ADT seal and their agricultural \ndata contracts\
    \ and agreements. \n \n64 Figure 6 depicts more than 100 technology firms that\
    \ are digitally transforming farming practices. \n65 Information available at:\
    \ https://www.agdatatransparent.com/about \n \n130 \nMany U.S. companies that\
    \ collect agricultural data have yet to commit to the \nagricultural data \"core\
    \ principles\" (Janzen, 202166). However, adopting a minimal policy \noption based\
    \ on the existing COP could be rapidly embraced and effectively implemented, \n\
    given the established principles and certification process recognized by large\
    \ farmer-led \nassociations. With clear role definitions and public institution\
    \ support, the number of \ncompanies participating and signing on to the \"core\
    \ principles\" and achieving Ag Data \nTransparent certification could significantly\
    \ increase in the short term. \nMoving forward, a moderate data governance policy\
    \ option could include not only \nintroducing safeguards for agricultural data\
    \ sharing but also enabling the flow and reuse of \nnon-personal public administrative\
    \ agricultural data. While this represents a new policy \ncontext and content,\
    \ forecasting its success is difficult. \nA maximalist data governance policy\
    \ would include both safeguards and enablers, \nprotecting data rights and facilitating\
    \ the use and re-use of public administrative \nagricultural data while ensuring\
    \ its safe flow among stakeholders. This policy would \npromote a trustworthy\
    \ agricultural data system by increasing awareness of the value of \nagricultural\
    \ data and encouraging participation in the ag sector data economy. However, \n\
    like the moderate policy alternative, projecting the effectiveness of this policy\
    \ prediction \nis challenging. \nThese three policy options are currently conceptual\
    \ and projecting their effectiveness is \ndifficult and insufficient. However,\
    \ based on a comparative macro analysis of the literature \nand the Global Data\
    \ Regulation diagnostic, which assesses data governance laws and \n \n66 Information\
    \ available at: https://www.agdatatransparent.com/about \n \n131 \nregulations\
    \ across 80 countries, it is accurate to project that a normative legal framework\
    \ \nfor agricultural data governance would be an important addition to the future\
    \ of the \nagricultural data economy in the U.S. \nPrediction \nForeseeing the\
    \ future impact of a data governance policy framework for the agriculture \nsector\
    \ in the United States involves considering the potential positive and negative\
    \ \nfeedback loops. These will be evaluated by institutions and stakeholders who\
    \ are subject \nto the enforcement of these regulations and norms. The predictive\
    \ approach relies on a set \nof causal assumptions about how a particular policy\
    \ may be implemented and what its \noutcomes will be. As a result, forecasting\
    \ the three policy options involves predicting not \nonly their feasibility but\
    \ also their impact on the agriculture sector. \nTo theorize and predict the feasibility\
    \ of the three agricultural data governance policy \noptions, this research section\
    \ draws on the notion of a collective action problem. This \napproach presents\
    \ a theoretical perspective that compares existing literature on collective \n\
    action to explain data governance as a current issue within the data economy.\
    \ The aim is \nto attempt a prediction that explains the reasons for adopting\
    \ a minimalist, moderate, or \nmaximalist policy alternative. \nThe Coleman Boat\
    \ model provides a predictive framework that outlines how certain \nfactors can\
    \ lead to specific outcomes through various mechanisms. In the context of \nagricultural\
    \ data governance, the Coleman Boat model represents the relationship between\
    \ \nthe macro and micro aspects of the social system. At the macro level, agricultural\
    \ data \ngovernance is institutionalized as a policy framework that sets the norms\
    \ for sector \n \n132 \nparticipation. The meso level is crucial in determining\
    \ whether individuals participate in \nand share data within the framework, as\
    \ their decisions are influenced by factors such as \ntrust, transparency, and\
    \ legitimacy. \nIntegrating Benfeldt et al.'s (2020) collective action theory\
    \ approach to data governance \ninto the model can offer a more comprehensive\
    \ insight into the meso and micro processes \nthat influence participation in\
    \ Ag-DG. This perspective highlights the challenges of \nmobilizing an organization\
    \ to adopt a data governance framework. It emphasizes the \nimportance of understanding\
    \ the internal dynamics of the system or organization, which \nincludes comprehending\
    \ the motivations and behaviors of individual actors. \nBenfeldt et al.'s (2020)\
    \ approach identifies six constituent challenges that must be \naddressed to successfully\
    \ adopt data governance within public organizations, including \nperceiving value,\
    \ enabling collaboration, fostering capabilities, data overview, local \npractices,\
    \ and political ambience (Benfeldt et al., 2020, 308). These challenges are \n\
    interrelated and form a \"problem triangle,\" as illustrated in Figure 22, which\
    \ is adapted to \nthe agricultural data governance policy problem. \n \n133 \n\
    Figure 22 Data Governance Collective Action Problem in Public Organizations \n\
    \ \nThe problem triangle describes the difficulties faced by actors with diverse\
    \ and possibly \nconflicting interests, who struggle to find common ground and\
    \ collaborate towards a shared \nobjective. By integrating Benfeldt's ideas into\
    \ the Coleman Boat model, we can gain a \nbetter understanding of how these challenges\
    \ affect individual and organizational \nparticipation in agricultural data governance.\
    \ \nAt the micro level, the challenge of recognizing the value of sharing data\
    \ may influence \nthe decisions of individual stakeholders to participate in Ag-DG.\
    \ Additionally, the \nchallenge of enabling collaboration may impact the effectiveness\
    \ of the framework as a \nwhole, as it influences how well stakeholders work together.\
    \ \nTo overcome these challenges, it is necessary to foster capabilities, provide\
    \ an overview \nof the available data, align local practices, and create a conducive\
    \ political environment. \nThis integrated framework provides a more comprehensive\
    \ explanation of the mechanisms \nthat lead to successful agricultural data governance.\
    \ \n \n134 \nBenfeldt et al. (2020, p.309) explain: \nPerceiving value of data\
    \ governance is challenging because actors in a \ncollective tend to ascribe different\
    \ meanings to the purpose or outcome \nof the collective action. Enabling collaboration\
    \ between functions on \ndata governance is complicated because actors tend to\
    \ take actions that \nprotect their individual interests at the expense of achieving\
    \ a greater \njoint outcome. Fostering capabilities for governing data is difficult\
    \ \nbecause doing so requires effectively managing heterogeneous resources \n\
    contributed by different actors to the common \"good\" produced in a \ncollective.\
    \ (Benfeldt et al., 2020, p. 309) \nAdopting a data governance framework is assumed\
    \ to be beneficial because it involves \nimplementing processes and principles\
    \ that are supposed to be enterprise-wide.” (Benfeldt \net al., 2020, p. 306).\
    \ Therefore, from a collective action theoretical perspective, agricultural \n\
    data has the potential to become a collective good based on the willingness and\
    \ capabilities \nof users to take advantage of it. \nIn addition, within the context\
    \ of the digital data economy, Kerber & Frank (2017) \npropose a framework that\
    \ identifies the main causes of potential market failure problems \nin data trading\
    \ within the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These market failure \nproblems\
    \ include information asymmetries about data quality and source, a lack of demand\
    \ \nfor data due to a lack of awareness of its value, a lack of interoperability\
    \ and \nstandardization, pricing problems, and strategic reasons for data holders\
    \ not to share, trade, \nor give access to data. \nIn the current agricultural\
    \ data landscape, private companies have demonstrated the \nvalue of collecting\
    \ and utilizing agricultural data. However, the U.S. Department of \n \n135 \n\
    Agriculture (USDA) has lagged behind in terms of data collection, integration,\
    \ and \nutilization. For instance, the USDA collects vast amounts of data to support\
    \ a diverse range \nof agricultural programs. Nevertheless, the lack of clear\
    \ collaboration across agencies has \nhindered data utilization. As a result,\
    \ there are numerous disconnected data silos within the \nUSDA that, at times,\
    \ require employees to make manual data calls to gather essential \ninformation\
    \ for analysis (Ristino & Hart, 2022, p. 5). Consequently, data-driven decision-\n\
    making practices are challenging to implement. \nExpert judgment or Conjecture\
    \ \nThe conjecture approach relies on expert judgments, which are valuable because\
    \ they \nconcentrate on predictions of future trends and implicit knowledge of\
    \ the probable \ntriumphs or failures of various policy options, instead of past\
    \ data or formal models. One \ncritical aspect of this approach is making conjectures\
    \ about the future state of technology \nand data. Moreover, it is important to\
    \ note that expert judgment or conjecture can be a \nvaluable tool in policy analysis\
    \ and the development of agricultural data governance \npolicies. While past data\
    \ and formal models are useful, expert judgment can provide \ninsights into future\
    \ trends and the potential success or failure of policy options. However, \nit\
    \ is essential to ensure that expert judgments are based on sound reasoning and\
    \ evidence, \nrather than personal bias or unsupported assumptions. \nFor instance,\
    \ the \"Data for Better Lives\" World Bank report argues that to use data for\
    \ \ndevelopment purposes, a legal framework for data governance is necessary,\
    \ which should \ninclude both safeguards and enablers (World Bank, 2021, p. 190).\
    \ Safeguards are legal \nframeworks and norms that ensure trust in data governance\
    \ and management by limiting \n \n136 \nharm from data misuse and breaches affecting\
    \ data security and integrity. Enablers refer to \npolicies, laws, regulations,\
    \ and standards that enable the use, reuse, and sharing of data \nwithin and between\
    \ stakeholder groups by promoting openness, interoperability, and \nportability.\
    \ \nIn Industry Revolution 4.0, a data governance framework approach is necessary\
    \ to \ntransform data into a strategic asset for organizations and sectors. In\
    \ the agriculture sector, \nscholars such as Jouanjean et al. (2020) and Wiseman\
    \ et al. (2019) agree that starting with \nsector-specific solutions is key to\
    \ solving data governance problems. \nFor example, Wiseman et al. (2019) examined\
    \ three of the four existing codes of \nconduct (COPs) on agricultural data, except\
    \ for the most recent one from Australia, and \nmade recommendations. The authors\
    \ suggested a farmer-centered COP on agricultural data \nas it would facilitate\
    \ broad adoption and have a greater impact. However, it is crucial to \nensure\
    \ the legitimacy of the code and those who administer and accredit compliance.\
    \ \nAdopting minimal normative regulation where farmers’ associations and agriculture\
    \ public \norganizations play a role could ensure proper implementation and enforcement\
    \ of an \nagricultural data governance policy. \nSanderson and Wiseman (2018)\
    \ stress the importance of developing a tailored data \ngovernance framework specific\
    \ to the agriculture sector, due to the distinct categories of \nagricultural\
    \ data. The use of voluntary-private membership contractual models, such as \n\
    COPs, is recommended by Wiseman et al. (2019) to ensure data sharing and gain\
    \ farmers' \ntrust. However, since COPs are governed through private data contractual\
    \ agreements, they \nmay be more suitable for agribusinesses and companies working\
    \ with farmers and using \n \n137 \ntheir data, rather than farmers-led organizations/associations.\
    \ Nevertheless, to ensure \nproper implementation and enforcement of COPs and\
    \ the credibility of farmers in their \nself-regulation, scholars argue that governments\
    \ must also play a role in agricultural data \nmanagement and practice (Wiseman\
    \ et al. 2019, p.13). This highlights the need for \nnormative regulation for\
    \ agricultural data governance that represents smallholder farmers, \nnot just\
    \ through associations but also directly. \nThe rapidly evolving IoT technology\
    \ requires regulatory efforts to be open to new \ninnovations in order to solve\
    \ data governance problems. Therefore, a legal framework for \ndata governance,\
    \ whether minimalist, moderate, or maximalist, should limit private parties' \n\
    freedom to produce, create, and use data in new ways only as necessary to address\
    \ market \nfailure problems, such as lack of rights on data, competition problems,\
    \ information \nproblems, and transaction cost problems (Kerber & Frank, 2017,\
    \ p. 17) and achieve other \nnormative societal objectives. \nA Two-Stage Model\
    \ for Agricultural Data Governance Policy Framework \nThis section also includes\
    \ a two-step feasibility analysis. In the first step, each policy \noption is\
    \ analyzed based on the identified policy problem components to determine the\
    \ \nfactors that could define the effects or consequences of the chosen policy's\
    \ success or \nfailure. The second step attempts to predict which policy option\
    \ would be feasible from a \npolicy process selection perspective. This step addresses\
    \ major issues influencing the \npolicy process, including incidents, ideas, interests,\
    \ institutions, inter-unit diffusion, and \nindustrialization. These elements\
    \ are crucial in the policy history process and require \nanswering a set of minimum\
    \ questions as part of the feasibility analysis to identify any \n \n138 \noutstanding\
    \ issues or concerns with each policy alternative. Figure 23 illustrates the two-\n\
    step process used to analyze each policy option and predict which one could be\
    \ feasibly \nadvocated for not only in terms of solving the agricultural data\
    \ governance policy problem \nbut also in terms of feasibility for adoption. \

    \ assigned to each \ndimension for each policy option. The specific values assigned\
    \ to each factor in each \ndimension for each policy option are detailed in the\
    \ annexes. Using the total sum of each \npolicy option for each dimension in the\

    \ \n145 \nof feasibility for implementing each policy option. The total sum was\
    \ a value of 10, \nrepresenting the sum of each dimension's possible value. \n\
    Tables 19 and 22 show that the Minimalist policy option receives high ratings\
    \ in the \nincidents and institutions dimensions but low ratings in the interests\
    \ and ideas, inter-unit \ndiffusion, and industrialization dimensions. The Minimalist\
    \ policy option appears to \nprioritize addressing the dimension of trust between\
    \ farmers and agricultural technology \nproviders in data sharing, with a high\
    \ level of feasibility in terms of incidents, institutions, \nand policy adoption\
    \ time and budget. However, it shows low feasibility in addressing the \ndimension\
    \ of data privacy and confidentiality norms and rights, and only moderate \nfeasibility\
    \ in the dimension of oversight, accountability, and transparency in data \nproduction\
    \ cycle. Concerning policy process feasibility, the Minimalist option has a \n\
    moderate percentage of policy feasibility, indicating that it may encounter some\
    \ challenges \nin terms of interest and ideas and inter-unit diffusion. \nBased\
    \ on the information provided in the two tables, it is important to note that\
    \ policy \noptions for agricultural data governance should be carefully considered\
    \ in terms of their \nfeasibility and ability to address the dimensions of the\
    \ problem. The Minimalist policy \noption may be effective in addressing the issue\
    \ of trust between farmers and agricultural \ntechnology providers in data sharing,\
    \ but may face challenges in terms of data privacy and \nconfidentiality norms\
    \ and rights, as well as oversight, accountability, and transparency in \nthe\
    \ data production cycle. It is also important to consider the level of policy\
    \ process \nfeasibility, which includes incidents, interests and ideas, institutions,\
    \ inter-unit diffusion, \nand industrialization. By carefully examining and selecting\
    \ the appropriate policy option, \n \n146 \npolicymakers can ensure that the agricultural\
    \ sector benefits from the use of data while also \nprotecting the rights and\
    \ interests of farmers and other stakeholders involved in the process. \nThe Moderate\
    \ policy option outperformed both the Minimalist and Maximalist options \nin both\
    \ dimensions. It achieved an 80% feasibility rate in the Policy Process Feasibility\
    \ \nDimension and an 83% problem response rate in the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem \ndimensions, making it the most viable option for addressing the issue.\
    \ \nThe Moderate option excelled in all four dimensions of the agricultural data\
    \ governance \nproblem, including trust between farmers and agricultural technology\
    \ providers in data \nsharing, data privacy and confidentiality norms and rights,\
    \ oversight, accountability, and \ntransparency in the data production cycle,\
    \ and digital transformation in the smart farming \nsector. It also received a\
    \ high score in the industrialization dimension of the Policy Process \nFeasibility\
    \ table, indicating that it is the most advantageous option for the sector's \n\
    advancement in the digital transformation era. \nThe Moderate policy option is\
    \ expected to have a significant impact on the agricultural \ndata governance\
    \ problem while remaining feasible for implementation. Therefore, it is the \n\
    most practical policy option for addressing the agricultural data governance problem.\
    \ \nDespite scoring high in all four dimensions of the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem, \nthe Moderate option may face obstacles in terms of adoption time\
    \ and budget, as rated as \nmedium in the Policy Options table. Furthermore, traditional\
    \ farmers may resist or pose \nbarriers to the option's implementation, despite\
    \ its high score in the industrialization \ndimension. It is therefore essential\
    \ to discuss these potential challenges to gain a more \n \n147 \ncomprehensive\
    \ understanding of the feasibility and potential impact of the Moderate policy\
    \ \noption. \nBased on the analysis so far, we can rule out the Maximalist option\
    \ because it received \nthe lowest score in all dimensions of the public policy\
    \ adoption process. The Maximalist \noption scored poorly in the effectiveness\
    \ dimension because it would likely face significant \nopposition from key stakeholders,\
    \ such as farmers, who may be unwilling to share their \ndata. In addition, the\
    \ Maximalist option's approach to data governance may not effectively \naddress\
    \ the problems associated with agricultural data governance. The Maximalist option\
    \ \nalso received a low score in the feasibility dimension because it would be\
    \ difficult to \nimplement given the current resource and capacity constraints.\
    \ It would require significant \nfunding and coordination between various institutions\
    \ and stakeholders, which may not be \nfeasible in the short term. Furthermore,\
    \ the Maximalist option may not be sustainable over \nthe long term as it may\
    \ face challenges in maintaining political and stakeholder support. \nTherefore,\
    \ based on the evidence gathered, it is unlikely that the Maximalist option would\
    \ \nbe the optimal policy for governing agricultural data. \nIn this research,\
    \ the policy problem of agricultural data governance has been analyzed, \nand\
    \ four main dimensions have been identified: data sharing, the data production\
    \ cycle, \ndata rights and norms, and smart farming. Based on these dimensions,\
    \ three policy options \nhave been developed to propose a policy framework that\
    \ addresses each dimension of the \nagricultural data policy problem. The proposed\
    \ policy options range from minimal to \nmaximalist government approaches, with\
    \ each option providing data safeguards, enablers, \nroles, and responsibilities\
    \ for governing agricultural data. After forecasting the outcomes \nof these three\
    \ policy options, it has been concluded that the minimalist and moderate \n \n\
    148 \napproaches are the most feasible options within the policy process, as they\
    \ not only solve \nthe agricultural data governance problem but also account for\
    \ new innovations and \ntechnological developments. In contrast, the maximalist\
    \ option fails to provide a realistic \nand feasible policy solution. Therefore,\
    \ the proposed two-stage model for agricultural data \ngovernance policy recommends\
    \ the adoption of the minimalist or moderate approach, \ndepending on the specific\
    \ needs and characteristics of each agricultural sector in the US. \n▪ \nPrescription:\
    \ The Final Step in Agricultural Data Governance \nPolicy Analysis  \nThe final\
    \ step in the policy analysis process is to propose a policy option that is most\
    \ \nlikely to resolve the governance issues of agricultural data in the United\
    \ States. This step \nis called prescription, and it focuses on policy choice\
    \ by considering the reasons for \nselecting a particular option. In other words,\
    \ it provides a means of selecting one policy \noption from among several possible\
    \ outcomes (Dunn, 2018, p. 190). In the remainder of \nthis chapter, this research\
    \ will examine which of the two feasible policy options, minimalist \nor moderate,\
    \ should be recommended based on the outcomes previously determined in the \n\
    agriculture sector. \nConsidering the trade-offs associated with collective action,\
    \ both the minimalist and \nmoderate policy alternatives are likely to achieve\
    \ the policy goal67 of balancing equity and \n \n67 Policy goal: “A desired outcome\
    \ of a policy; these goals can be explicitly stated or implicit in the \npolicy\
    \ and other factors found in its legislative history” (Birkland, 2016, p. 236)\
    \ \n \n149 \nefficiency68 among the proposed agricultural data governance policy\
    \ options. These policy \nalternatives aim to address the lack of data standardization,\
    \ access, sharing, and use, not \nonly to enhance agricultural practices and productivity,\
    \ but also to improve crop yields, \nnutritional quality, and promote sustainable\
    \ agriculture overall. \nThe minimalist policy option aims to implement and practice\
    \ data governance principles \nbased on the United States COP Core Principles\
    \ effectively. Its purpose is to monitor \ncompliance with the Core Principles\
    \ in contractual agreements to enable a trusted data-\nsharing system across the\
    \ U.S. agriculture sector. On the other hand, the moderate policy \nalternative\
    \ for agricultural data governance not only aims to implement and practice data\
    \ \ngovernance Core Principles but also assigns roles and responsibilities for\
    \ data access and \nsharing. It also emphasizes the use of data value and promotes\
    \ sector collaboration. \nHowever, achieving a well-balanced solution between\
    \ the interests of various \nstakeholders can be a complex task. Therefore, proposing\
    \ a specific policy option requires \nan evaluation to determine the best approach.\
    \ In governing agricultural data, the aim is to \nmaximize the benefits of sharing\
    \ and using such data in relation to the costs of not currently \nutilizing large\
    \ amounts of unshared agricultural data due to stakeholders' distrust. \nSharing\
    \ and using agricultural data can significantly improve agricultural productivity\
    \ \nand risk management, including adaptation or mitigation of the effects of\
    \ climate change \n(OECD, 2019). Data-driven decisions could also enhance international\
    \ market access and \nopen up new digital trade opportunities, which would benefit\
    \ agricultural productivity, \n \n68 Efficiency: “Gaining the most output for\
    \ a given level of input… [it] is often thought of as getting the \nsame output\
    \ for less of a particular input, or getting more of something for a constant\
    \ input.” (Birkland, \n2016, p. 233). \n \n150 \nprofitability, food security,\
    \ and the overall digitalization of the agricultural sector, leading \nto data-ization.\
    \ \nTo summarize, proposing a policy option for governing agricultural data in\
    \ the United \nStates necessitates careful consideration of the trade-offs associated\
    \ with collective action, \nas well as an in-depth assessment of the costs and\
    \ benefits of the available policy \nalternatives. Prescription, the final step\
    \ in the policy analysis process, focuses on selecting \nthe best policy option\
    \ based on its potential outcomes.  \nIn this case, the minimalist and moderate\
    \ policy alternatives are the most feasible \nalternatives for achieving the policy\
    \ goal of balancing equity and efficiency in agricultural \ndata governance. The\
    \ minimalist policy option seeks to monitor compliance with COP \nprinciples,\
    \ whereas the moderate policy option assigns roles and responsibilities for data\
    \ \naccess and sharing while emphasizing data value and encouraging sector collaboration.\
    \ \nCost-effective analysis and costs and benefits analysis will be used to determine\
    \ the best \napproach for governing agricultural data and maximizing the benefits\
    \ of sharing and using \nsuch data in relation to the costs for the agriculture\
    \ sector in the U.S. \nCost Effective Analysis  \nCost-effectiveness analysis\
    \ (CEA) is a useful method that enables a comparison of \npolicy options not only\
    \ based on their effectiveness (benefits) measured in units of public \ngoods\
    \ or services but also on the costs associated with achieving different levels\
    \ of benefits \nthat may be more effective at a lower cost (Dunn, 2018, p. 217).\
    \ Therefore, the CEA \nmethod can be employed to examine and compare the benefits\
    \ that the minimalist policy \noption for agricultural data governance offers\
    \ in comparison to the moderate policy option \n \n151 \nand the status quo, which\
    \ is doing nothing at all. Through this evaluation process, it will \nbe possible\
    \ to determine the most cost-effective and beneficial policy option for the \n\
    agricultural sector. \nThree criteria are commonly used in CEA. The first is the\
    \ adequacy analysis, which \nexamines whether a policy option can meet minimal\
    \ standards of benefit at some maximal \ncost level. The second criterion, cost\
    \ minimization, evaluates whether a policy option has \nthe lowest costs for some\
    \ minimally acceptable level of benefits. Finally, the third criterion, \nbenefit\
    \ maximization, assesses whether a policy option provides the greatest benefits\
    \ for \nsome maximally acceptable level of costs. Applying these criteria will\
    \ enable us to identify \nthe most cost-effective policy option for governing\
    \ agricultural data in the U.S. \nThe cost effectiveness of agricultural data\
    \ governance policy framework will depend on \nseveral factors: \n- \nThe volume\
    \ and complexity of the data: The more data that needs to be collected, \nstored,\
    \ and managed, the more costly it may be to implement effective \ngovernance policy.\
    \ \n- \nThe level of risk associated with the data: If the data is sensitive or\
    \ valuable, more \nstringent security measures may be required, which may increase\
    \ the cost. \n- \nThe level of collaboration required: If multiple stakeholders\
    \ are involved in the \ndata collection and use, it may be more costly to coordinate\
    \ their efforts and \nensure that everyone is following the same data governance\
    \ guidelines and \nstandards. \n \n152 \n- \nThe availability of funding: The\
    \ availability of funding can play a significant role \nin the cost effectiveness\
    \ of agricultural data governance policy framework. If \nsufficient resources\
    \ are available, more robust governance measures may be \nimplemented. \nAn effective\
    \ agricultural data governance policy should ultimately balance the costs of \n\
    implementing governance measures with the benefits of ensuring that data is collected,\
    \ \nstored, and used in a way that benefits all stakeholders. This balance is\
    \ crucial to ensure \nthat the policy is sustainable and provides value to the\
    \ agricultural sector. \nThe comparison between the two policy options (minimalist\
    \ and moderate) showed that \nwhile policy option II (moderate) may achieve higher\
    \ overall benefit maximization by \nallocating more funds, policy option I (minimalist)\
    \ achieves the minimum standard of \nbenefits of data governance at the lowest\
    \ cost, making it the most effective choice. The \nCEA method did not identify\
    \ any potential problems or unintended consequences of either \npolicy implementation.\
    \ Implementing a design and strategy to improve data governance \nand its consumption\
    \ is a challenging task. Therefore, Policy Option I will be pursued as it \nwill\
    \ serve as the foundation for Policy Option II. This approach provides a significant\
    \ \nbenefit and is the most efficient way to implement an agricultural data governance\
    \ policy \nsolution. Table 23 presents a comparison of the results of the cost-effectiveness\
    \ analysis. \n \n153 \nTable 23 Cost Effectiveness Analysis \nPolicy \nBenefit\

    \ and Benefits  \nIn this section, the forecasted effects of the minimal and moderate\
    \ policies are compared \nto a \"status quo\" situation, which represents the\
    \ measures or values of benefits and costs if \nthe policy vacuum scenario for\
    \ agricultural data governance persists. Maintaining the status \nquo of agricultural\
    \ data practices is also considered as one of the possible options. \nTo begin\
    \ this process of evaluating policy options for agricultural data governance,\
    \ it is \nnecessary to identify and categorize the costs and benefits associated\
    \ with each option. This \nanalysis should consider both direct and indirect costs\
    \ and benefits that are relevant to the \npolicy options being considered. Additionally,\
    \ the importance of each factor should be \nranked to help determine the relative\
    \ weight of each element in selecting among the \noptions. \nTo clarify, estimated\
    \ direct benefits are primary outcomes of a policy option that directly \naddress\
    \ the structured policy problem dimensions for the targeted population. On the\
    \ other \nhand, estimated indirect benefits are secondary outcomes that are associated\
    \ with less \nvalued benefits than the flow (access, sharing, and using) of agricultural\
    \ data governance, \nbut still contribute to solving the agricultural data governance\
    \ problem on a smaller scale. \n \n154 \nDirect estimated benefits refer to the\
    \ benefits that can be directly attributed to the \nimplementation of a policy\
    \ option. In the case of agricultural data governance, these \nbenefits would\
    \ focus on improving access, sharing, and the use of agricultural data. \nExamples\
    \ of these benefits could include the development of data-sharing standards, \n\
    incentivizing farmers, producers to share data, and building a data-sharing infrastructure\
    \ \nwithin agricultural research. The literature review was an effective source\
    \ for projecting \nthese direct estimated benefits. \nPotential indirect benefits\
    \ of facilitating data-sharing standards, safeguards, and \nenablers in agriculture\
    \ include increased collaboration between domain researchers and \ndata scientists,\
    \ as well as the development of a data-sharing infrastructure within \nagricultural\
    \ research. This can lead to increased research investment, and the recovery of\
    \ \nunpublished data, which can further support innovation and knowledge creation\
    \ in the \nfield. These indirect benefits may not be immediately apparent, but\
    \ can have a significant \nimpact on the overall success of agricultural research\
    \ and development efforts (Brouder et \nal., 2019, p. 2). \nTable 24 Estimated\

    \ open databases). \n \nThe digital economy has emerged alongside the flow of\
    \ data, creating the potential for \nsignificant innovation and benefits for users\
    \ (Howell, 2022, p.1). Data has two distinct \ncharacteristics that set it apart\
    \ from other goods: it is non-competing and displays network \neffects. This means\
    \ that a single piece of data has the capacity to provide multiple benefits \n\
    to multiple applications, and when combined with additional information, its value\
    \ \nincreases. To fully realize the potential of data, reliable data-sharing solutions\
    \ must be \ndeveloped, and this is where data governance comes into play. By ensuring\
    \ proper data \ngovernance, we can unlock the benefits of data while mitigating\
    \ risks and promoting ethical \npractices. \n \n157 \nThese potential benefits\
    \ can be observed in the wine industry, where having a \ntrustworthy system for\
    \ contractual agreements in place to access, share, and use data can \nplay a\
    \ significant role in sustaining a vibrant transatlantic trade relationship between\
    \ the \nEU and US wine sectors. This sector is a vital driving force in many rural\
    \ economies and \na significant number of medium and small businesses. Implementing\
    \ a data governance \nframework will incentivize government agencies to intervene\
    \ by collecting, linking, and \nanalyzing data to support the economic vitality\
    \ and diversity of the wine sectors. For \ninstance, this can involve working\
    \ on tariffs on wine to achieve a 'zero for zero' wine trade \nenvironment (Featherstone,\
    \ 2021). However, the US wine industry has recently faced \nchallenges due to\
    \ President Donald J. Trump's administration's imposition of a 25% tariff \non\
    \ French, Spanish, German, and English wines in October 2019, which led to a drop\
    \ of \nnearly $500 million in the value of French wine exports to the US in 202069.\
    \ \nDirect estimated benefits are essential in evaluating the significance of\
    \ collaborating \nwith provider users who have access to data and information\
    \ on pests and diseases to \ndevelop research on a single platform. An example\
    \ to consider is the PlantwisePlus \nKnowledge Bank70 and the CABI Digital Library\

    \ tools, among other \nadvantages. \nAnother example of how data governance solutions\
    \ can incentivize partnerships \nbetween public agencies and private companies\
    \ is the Agmatix initiative72. Agmatix is a \nstartup ag-tech company that has\
    \ developed a single engine to digitize research data, \nenabling agro-professionals\
    \ to increase crop yields and quality while minimizing \nenvironmental impact.\
    \ By employing machine learning and artificial intelligence, Agmatix \ncreates\
    \ statistically and scientifically stronger models and decision support systems,\
    \ which \ncan aid in the mainstream adoption of big data in agronomy to increase\
    \ global yields. The \nAgmatix platform facilitates the development of statistical\
    \ agricultural models, which can \nhelp reduce food waste and support global food\
    \ security in light of population growth. \nAgriculture science can be better\
    \ translated into practice through the implementation of \na data governance framework\
    \ for the sector. Such a framework can help provide policy \nmakers with access\
    \ to less fragmented, partial, and biased evidence, allowing for more \ninformed\
    \ decision-making. Additionally, according to PwC, IoT-enabled Agricultural \n\
    (IoTAg) monitoring is the fastest-growing technology segment in smart, connected\
    \ \nagriculture, with an expected market value of $4.5 billion by 2025 (Columbus,\
    \ 2021). \nThe estimated benefits highlighted above illustrate the value of implementing\
    \ an \nagricultural data governance policy. Establishing data safeguards and enablers\
    \ through \npolicy measures will facilitate the advancement of data sharing. Incorporating\

    \ the two public policy options. Estimated direct costs represent the minimum\
    \ \namount required for each policy option to achieve the desired benefits and\
    \ outcomes. \nAlthough these costs are typically expressed in monetary terms to\
    \ gauge the advantages \nand disadvantages of a given policy option, it is impractical\
    \ to provide precise monetary \nestimates for each cost category in this research\
    \ on solving agricultural data governance \nissues in the U.S. This is due to\
    \ the fact that agricultural costs are constantly fluctuating, \nand data accuracy\
    \ can be inconsistent. Nevertheless, the estimated costs provided are \nsupported\

    \ of data generated each day will reach 463 \nexabytes (Bonner, 2022), highlighting\
    \ the growing importance of developing sustainable \n \n161 \ndata management\
    \ processes. Some studies have attempted to quantify the cost of poor data \n\
    quality. For example, according to a 2016 report by IBM (Redman, 2016), poor-quality\
    \ \ndata73 costs businesses $3.1 trillion annually in the United States alone.\
    \ Sakpal (2021) \nestimated that poor data quality costs organizations an average\
    \ of $15 million per year. \nMoreover, a study by Experian in 2020 found that\
    \ inaccurate data cost businesses an \naverage of 12% of their annual revenue.\
    \ These numbers are only estimates and may not be \napplicable to all organizations,\
    \ but they give a general sense of the significant financial \nimpact of poor\
    \ data quality. In addition to revenue impacts, poor-quality data or a lack of\
    \ \ndata can lead to flawed decision-making and assessments over time (Bonner,\
    \ 2022). Access \nand shareability are crucial for data to be useful. \nEvaluating\
    \ risk costs is important when determining which policy option has a lower \n\
    risk of harm. However, estimating potential consequences and external factors\
    \ that may \naffect outcomes is challenging (Aven, 2014, p. 20). Probabilities\
    \ are conditional (if...then) \nand based on prior knowledge about the event,\
    \ such as scientific knowledge, data, \nassumptions, perceptions, and beliefs\
    \ (Aven, 2014, p.23). Therefore, probability-based risk \nassessment costs for\
    \ an agricultural data policy framework are primarily informed by \nprevious knowledge\
    \ of agricultural data issues. For instance, in the US agriculture sector, \n\
    data access and use by others continue to be dependent on individual contractual\
    \ \nagreements, aided by one-time trial-and-error data transfer solutions (Cragin\
    \ et al. 2010). \nA significant barrier remains the lack of funding for synthesis\
    \ research using aggregated \n \n73 Poor quality data can include inaccurate information,\
    \ incomplete data, non-formatted information, \nirrelevant content, or even duplicate\
    \ data. \n \n162 \ndata. Concerns about data privacy, security, and intellectual\
    \ property also prevent emerging \ndata-sharing efforts, particularly those involving\
    \ public-private partnerships. \nTo assess risk, it's important to measure or\
    \ calculate expected values or costs, which are \nknown as risk metrics. These\
    \ can provide valuable information about the level of risk in a \nspecific situation.\
    \ For example, in the United States, the infrastructure deficit poses a risk \n\
    to agriculture's ability to comply with \"open access\" policies. When assessing\
    \ risk at the \nmacro policy and governance levels, it's important to consider\
    \ not only the likelihood of a \nrisky event occurring and causing harm, but also\
    \ the unknown consequences and the \npotential human reactions, behaviors, and\
    \ attitudes towards it. \nThe public's expectations for accessing and using agricultural\
    \ science to make informed \ndecisions span a wide range of land management, from\
    \ understanding food's nutritional \nvalue for diet modification to vastly improving\
    \ precision technology application for \nprofitable crop and animal production\
    \ and environmental protection (Brouder et al., 2019, \np. 3). As such, risk is\
    \ a function of the implementation of public policy. It is important to \nevaluate\
    \ the likelihood of potential risks and their associated costs if policy option\
    \ one or \ntwo is implemented. \nUncertainties around funding could raise concerns\
    \ about the feasibility of functional, \nhybrid business data models that could\
    \ complement existing public financing data models \nthrough short-term research\
    \ grants or national funding (Brouder et al., 2019, p. 13). The \ncost of the\
    \ envisioned data infrastructure is largely unknown, but undoubtedly, significant\
    \ \ninvestment will be required. Data stewardship, as opposed to simple storage,\
    \ involves \n \n163 \nadditional workflows and human resources (Bourne, Lorsch,\
    \ and Green 2015), which \nfurther exacerbates cost concerns and uncertainty.\
    \ \nThe costs of modernizing agriculture data infrastructure (Ristino & Hart,\
    \ 2022) and \nrestructuring the USDA to oversee COP principles in contractual\
    \ agreements are estimated \nto be directly associated with the minimalist policy\
    \ option I. Modernizing the USDA will \nprovide a foundation for the moderate\
    \ policy option II, which aims to oversee agriculture \ndata intermediaries and\
    \ their processing, storage, analysis, and provision of other data \nservices\
    \ to farmers and producers. Estimated remaining costs in USDA modernization, \n\
    such as the formation of an agricultural data governance board for policy option\
    \ II to \npromote secure and safe agricultural data flow between data intermediaries,\
    \ farmers, and \nproducers, are lower. By modernizing USDA agencies, the agricultural\
    \ sector will witness \nincreased innovation, implementation of digital technologies\
    \ and tools, food security, \nsustainability, and a digitally transformed sector.\
    \ \nFindings \nThe analysis presented dismisses the status quo as an unrealistic\
    \ alternative, as it fails \nto provide any benefits while increasing costs and\
    \ risks associated with the loss of data \nliteracy and informed decision-making.\
    \ Policy option I is the best scenario, given the \ngovernment's allocation of\
    \ funds in the agricultural sector, as it offers the greatest benefit \nfor cost.\
    \ The cost and benefits analysis supports its implementation, as it will enhance\
    \ the \nstewardship and ownership of agricultural data, providing stakeholders\
    \ with a better \nunderstanding of the implications of ongoing technological innovations\
    \ in the sector. \nHowever, budget constraints may limit the scope of this option.\
    \ \n \n164 \nPolicy option II builds upon the foundation of policy option I and\
    \ can potentially provide \nadditional benefits. However, it may not necessarily\
    \ result in reduced costs compared to \npolicy option I. A more comprehensive\
    \ analysis that takes into account potential entry \nbarriers and the potential\
    \ for diminishing returns on investment may be necessary to fully \nunderstand\
    \ the economic impact of policy option II. Currently, both Cost-Effective \nAnalysis\
    \ and Costs and Benefits do not provide a clear picture of this impact. Policy\
    \ option \nI appears to be the most viable scenario in terms of costs and benefits.\
    \  \nThe CBA further supports this conclusion, as it confirms that maximizing\
    \ efficiency \nand minimizing costs will be critical to the successful implementation\
    \ of data governance \nin the agricultural sector. By adopting a comprehensive\
    \ approach to data stewardship and \nownership, farmers and producers can minimize\
    \ risks while maximizing outputs, all while \nmaintaining accurate records for\
    \ regulatory compliance. \nIn summary, the evidence suggests that policy option\
    \ I provides the best balance of \nbenefits and costs for the agricultural sector,\
    \ with policy option II serving as a logical \nextension of policy option I. By\
    \ adopting a forward-thinking approach to data governance \nand management, the\
    \ government can lay the groundwork for a sustainable and secure \nagricultural\
    \ future, while farmers and producers can enjoy the benefits of increased data\
    \ \nliteracy and informed decision-making. \n \n \n165 \nConclusion \nIn the era\
    \ of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, data is no longer just a byproduct of \n\
    agricultural activities; it has become a valuable commodity in its own right.\
    \ As the \nagriculture sector undergoes digital transformation, there is a growing\
    \ need for a \ncomprehensive data governance policy framework that can facilitate\
    \ the secure and \nefficient management of agricultural data.  \nThe analysis\
    \ of the agricultural data governance policy problem and the three policy \noptions\
    \ presented in this dissertation highlight the need for modernizing the agricultural\
    \ \ndata infrastructure in the U.S. agriculture sector. The core of this research\
    \ lies in identifying \na significant policy problem, specifically the lack of\
    \ a comprehensive agricultural data \ngovernance policy. Through this research,\
    \ the aim was to ask the appropriate questions to \naddress this issue from a\
    \ policy perspective, and propose potential solutions that can be \neffective\
    \ in facilitating the digital transformation of the agriculture sector.  \nThe\
    \ objective of an agricultural data governance policy framework is to promote\
    \ data \nsharing and reuse in the sector while protecting personal data and privacy.\
    \ A policy \nframework for cross-sector data sharing can establish clear rules,\
    \ such as obtaining consent \nand safeguarding personal data, promoting responsible\
    \ data sharing. This framework \nencourages innovation and competition while ensuring\
    \ that data is used for the greater good \nof agriculture in the U.S.  \nThis\
    \ research recommends implementing policy options to establish a secure and safe\
    \ \nflow of agricultural data between data intermediaries, farmers, and producers.\
    \ This \ninitiative will serve as a foundation for sector innovation, increase\
    \ the implementation of \n \n166 \ndigital technologies and tools, and promote\
    \ food security, sustainability, and a digitally \ntransformed sector. \nIn addition,\
    \ providing guidelines and objectives for agricultural data governance and \n\
    management will empower farmers and producers to make informed decisions based\
    \ on \ndata analysis, resulting in increased productivity and economic growth.\
    \ In summary, \nmodernizing agricultural data infrastructure and potentially implementing\
    \ policy options I \nand II are crucial for sustaining and growing the agricultural\
    \ sector. These policies will \nimprove data stewardship and ownership, enhance\
    \ sector innovation and efficiency, and \nadvance food security, sustainability,\
    \ and the digital transformation of the sector. \nOne of the key contributions\
    \ of this doctoral research is the proposal of a two-step \npolicy, which represents\
    \ an innovative approach to addressing the challenges posed by the \nFourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution and the digital transformation of the economy in the \nagriculture\
    \ policy subsystem. This policy recommendation represents an attempt at policy\
    \ \ninnovation that has the potential to facilitate the adoption of new technologies\
    \ and promote \nsustainable agriculture practices. By proposing this new approach,\
    \ this research is offering \nvaluable insights into how policymakers can adapt\
    \ to the changing technological landscape \nand ensure that the agricultural sector\
    \ is well-positioned to thrive in the future. \nMoving forward, the next recommended\
    \ step would be to conduct a stakeholder \nassessment in the agricultural sector\
    \ to identify opportunities and challenges related to \nimplementing an agricultural\
    \ data governance policy. This assessment will allow for a \nbetter understanding\
    \ of the needs and concerns of stakeholders, including farmers, \nproducers, and\
    \ data intermediaries. Based on the findings of the assessment, a collaborative\
    \ \n \n167 \nprocess can be initiated to engage stakeholders in discussions and\
    \ agreements of \ncooperation to facilitate the implementation of an agricultural\
    \ data governance policy. This \nwill require a multidisciplinary approach, involving\
    \ policymakers, industry leaders, and \nacademia to ensure that the policy is\
    \ effective, beneficial, and aligned with the digital \ntransformation of the\
    \ agriculture sector. \nBy highlighting the importance of a data-driven approach\
    \ to agriculture and the potential \nbenefits of using data as an additional product\
    \ in this sector, this study hopes to contribute \nto the ongoing conversation\
    \ surrounding agricultural data governance and encourage \nfurther research and\
    \ policy development in this area. This research underscores the need \nfor policymakers\
    \ and stakeholders to prioritize modernizing the agricultural sector and \ndeveloping\
    \ a robust data governance policy framework to ensure the future of food security\
    \ \nand economic development. \nIn conclusion, it is necessary to implement an\
    \ agricultural data governance policy that \npromote responsible data use, foster\
    \ transparency and trust, and facilitate innovation and \ngrowth in the sector.\

    Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in
    critical infrastructures, necessitates strict security and

    privacy standards. Owing to data proliferation, Cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely
    on computing platforms for the provision of services

    and resources. The futuristic “Beyond 5G” (B5G) enabled critical IoT infrastructures
    cannot run on centralized systems due to their

    security vulnerabilities that compromise the basic Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability
    (CIA) triad. Blockchain technology (BCT) is

    emerging as a key enabler in addressing IoT’s security challenges, and it is compliant
    with the Fog-IoT architecture. The Ethereum

    platform has ushered an unprecedented development in BCT by facilitating application
    development. Blockchain (BC) connects the

    users’ chain identity to the transactions associated with their tokenized digital
    assets and confers the ability to audit the system. The

    history of canonical transactions is recorded in an immutable fashion facilitating
    data tracking and deterrence of data repudiation. A

    Consensus mechanism (CM) governs the state transitions and the node behavior in
    building trust relationships between various entities

    in the absence of a central authority. Through Smart Contracts(SCs), distributed
    and trustworthy access control can be achieved for

    IoT systems besides enhancing automation. We argue that BCT adoption is inevitable
    in securing futuristic B5G enabled IoT critical

    infrastructures for ensuring flexible and fine-grained access control, authentication,
    communication, and data security. Various challenges

    are associated with their adoption, such as the rising cost of Ethereum and constraints
    in the IoT environment. To facilitate BC solutions

    for IoT security, the functionality of BCT must be complemented with other technologies
    such as Machine Learning (ML), Edge

    Computing (EC), and InterPlanetary Filesystem(IPFS).

    1. INTRODUCTION

    The industry is rapidly evolving into a holistic network

    of intelligent systems capable of making data-driven deci-

    sions. Many technologies have aided this transition, with

    IoT being at the core. IoT connects devices and couples

    them to the internet forming a CPS. IoT is at the center

    of intelligent applications in and outside the industry. IoT

    offers the remote control and monitoring of equipment

    and catalyzes data-driven automated decision and action-

    taking capabilities, resulting in increased system efficiency

    and throughput while lowering costs. IoT is causing a

    major upward shift in the revenue pool, and its growth

    can be assessed by the increase in the number of practical

    applications across regions.

    IoT enables a pervasive interconnection of virtual and

    physical objects for accelerated data sharing and collection.

    Sensing capabilities are embedded in intelligent devices

    such as smartphones, laptops, and fitness monitors, while

    intelligence is built into traditional sensors for extensive

    data monitoring. As per the Ericson report, by 2050, there

    will be 24 billion interconnected IoT devices [1]. The data

    streams are generated continuously with volumes reaching

    exabytes; thus, the data is referred to as IoT Big data. At

    present, Cloud Computing and Fog Computing are the most

    popular provisions to handle the high-end computing and

    storage demands of IoT big data [2].

    IoT aims to create intelligent, unified, fully distributed,

    secure, and cost-efficient systems. Reliable storage, data

    awareness, ease of access, scalability, and channel security

    are important parameters while adopting a wireless system.

    IoT systems come with inbuilt security measures that can

    be bypassed due to their intrinsic traits.Various factors are

    responsible for hindering the pace of IoT security. These

    include:

    1)

    Any end- end encryption technique employed to

    provide data security in networks is challenging to

    be embedded in IoT networks due to the constrained

    nature of the devices.

    2)

    IoT devices are lodged in uncontrollable, heteroge-

    neous, complex, open, untrustworthy environments,

    which magnify the attack space.

    3)

    Lack of standard architecture, a common address-

    ing scheme limits the integration and replication of

    security measures from other IoT systems.

    4)

    IoT is an ever-growing field, and the security features

    of constrained devices are not evolving at the same

    pace as the system itself.

    5)

    The adoption of computing platforms forces frequent

    transfer of data. Implementing robust cryptographic

    algorithms is expensive and increases the overall cost

    of the system.

    6)

    IoT systems communicate across different domains

    and require fine-grained Access control(AC) mecha-

    nisms for collaboration.

    Cloud and Fog platforms are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and

    fail to meet the demand for flexible cross-domain interop-

    erability across multiple systems with distributed resources.

    The Data Management (DM) systems are centralized and

    prone to hackers who can manipulate the database, thereby

    compromising data integrity. The overreliance on a central-

    ized database causes the “Single point failure” problem. The

    monetary transactions require the intermediation of a third

    party, which incurs verification costs and increases privacy

    concerns. These centralized architectures are prone to secu-

    rity threats that disorder the regular operation of systems.

    These include Denial of Services(DoS), Distributed Denial

    of Services(DDoS), Ransomware attacks, Eavesdropping,

    Side-channel attacks, Spoofing, Routing attacks, Man in the

    middle attack, SQL injection, and Phishing [3].

    With the advancement in B5G technology, IoT is set to

    transform the existing digital landscape, but its inadequate

    security features have limited its adoption. B5G mobile

    communication technologies aim to provide high-speed

    transmission network support and enormous access points

    to maximize IoT capabilities [4]. The security measures of

    such applications need enhanced security and efficient DM.

    BCT is emerging as a promising paradigm for bringing

    disruptions in IoT security and is highly compliant with

    the Fog-like system of architecture [5].

    BCT has created a paradigm shift by enabling trusted and

    anonymous transactions. BCT establishes trust between the

    communicating nodes, and the decision-making is based

    on CMs suitable in distributed environments. Owing to its

    unique propensities– Immutability, Transparency, Traceabil-

    ity, Resilience, and Encryption, the adoption of BCT is

    suitable for the realization of futuristic peer-peer, trustless

    applications. BCT supports tokenized assets, and the nodes

    in the network interact automatically without the interven-

    tion of any central authority. This increases the privacy of

    the network and eliminates the management cost.

    BCT is creating major reforms in IoT management and se-

    curity. The IoT transactions are encrypted and secured using

    digital signatures and cryptographic keys. BCT eliminates

    the security threats with a distributed CM and provides a

    Figure 1. Centralized Vs. BC-based IoT

    true system state upon which every legitimate user agrees.

    With the integration of BCT, IoT applications are becoming

    decentralized, transactions are trusted and anonymous, and

    cross-domain interaction is enhanced. The system security

    is increased through ownership records, encrypted trans-

    actions, distributed storage, consensus, and authentication

    mechanisms. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between a

    centralized and BC-based IoT system.

    There are multiple challenges concerning the BC integrated

    IoT systems, such as network complexity, limited band-

    width, computation capabilities, data diversity, scalability,

    and throughput. Conventional CMs consume huge amounts

    of resources to slow down the access rate of new blocks and

    protect the BC network from attacks, which is too expensive

    for resource-limited IoT devices. Further, the capacity of a

    new block is limited, and transactions per second (TPS)

    are usually limited to 20 to 30 TPS in Ethereum, rendering

    the system unable to respond to the influx of transactions

    [6]. With tradeoffs between adversity tolerance, latency,

    and energy consumption, research on IoT suitable CMs is

    growing.

    BC itself suffers from security and privacy issues. Imple-

    menting longer chains is challenging, and the SCs can prove

    to be a double-edged sword. The cost of Ethereum is rising

    continuously, making the storage and transactions expen-

    sive for large-scale adoption. The underlying technologies

    powering BCT consume high power and are not suitable for

    IoT. BCT can revolutionize IoT, but enabling technologies

    such as IPFS, ML and EC must be integrated with BC to

    outweigh its current limitations.

    IPFS is a distributed file system that can resolve BC

    –IoT big data problems. Instead of storing the data on

    the chain, IPFS hashes identifying the files are kept in

    the BC. The hash on the BC assures that the file has not

    been tampered with. File hashes can be used to link files

    to their owners and access rights.Solving complex puzzles

    such as Proof of work consumes a significant amount of

    CPU time and energy, making it unsuitable for resource-

    constrained IoT nodes. EC enables edge devices to carry out

    data resource incentive transactions and can be leveraged for

    performing consensus. Information hidden in IoT big data

    can be harnessed by feeding them to ML models, producing

    more generalized results on big data.The integrity of the

    data can be maintained by feeding trustworthy data to ML

    through BC. Conversely, more security can be imparted into

    BC through ML.

    BCT is regarded as a promising technology for IoT because

    it provides significant solutions for decentralized networks

    that address trust and security concerns. Although BC

    outperforms centralized solutions in network security, BC-

    IoT integration is still in its early stages of adoption. Many

    challenges such as cost, compatibility, and privacy issues

    hinder the widespread adoption of BC security solutions

    in IoT. To realize the full potential of BC-based IoT,

    exhaustive research is necessary for exploring the enabling

    technologies for BC in lightweight( LW) environments.

    A. Objective and Contribution

    This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview

    of the potential and challenges of BC-based IoT security

    solutions and enabling technologies, open issues, possible

    solutions, and future research directions. There are four

    focal research points of our study, and are listed below-

    1)

    Firstly, to highlight the problems in centralized-based

    IoT solutions and understand why shifting to BC-

    based solutions is necessary.

    2)

    Since the robustness of a BC-based system is highly

    dependent on its underlying consensus mechanism,

    the aim is to conduct an in-depth comparative anal-

    ysis of CMs that are IoT suitable.

    3)

    Thirdly, to critically review the existing BC-based

    IoT security solutions in view of five IoT security

    tasks-

    a)

    Key Management and Access control.

    b)

    Device Authentication.

    c)

    Routing Security.

    d)

    Malware Prevention. and

    e)

    Data Protection and Secure Database Manage-

    ment.

    4)

    Fourthly, to highlight the open challenges in the

    BC-IoT integration and list out key future research

    directions.

    The main contributions of the paper are as follows:

    1)

    We have conducted a thorough survey of recent

    surveys(2019-early 2022) on BCT applicability in

    IoT. Other researchers may find this pool useful as

    a starting point for their research.

    2)

    We have discussed BC as a key enabling technology

    for IoT and three technologies that power BC-IoT.

    3)

    We have reviewed CMs in light of IoT.

    4)

    A primary literature review of the recent BC inte-

    grated IoT solutions in perspective of five specific

    IoT security tasks.

    5)

    We have discussed the cost analysis of IoT storage

    through SCs, network traffic modeling, SC vulner-

    abilities, BC transactional privacy, and other chal-

    lenges.

    6)

    We have thoroughly discussed the open issues and

    presented strong research directions.

    B. Paper Organization

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In

    Section 2, the scope of the survey is presented. Section

    3 presents the security vulnerabilities of six critical IoT

    applications and lays the rationale for moving toward de-

    centralized architectures. In Section 4, we briefly provide

    an overview of BCT, its architecture, and CMs. Section 5

    presents the highlights of the recent surveys (2019-early

    2022). Based on the study in section 5, we discuss BC as

    a key facilitator for IoT and technologies that accelerate

    BC adoption in IoT in Section 6. In Section 7, a detailed

    study of BC integrated IoT security architectures and a

    comparison of various CMs, their adoption, and tradeoffs

    is discussed. In section 8, a literature review of BC-based

    security solutions is presented. In section 9, we present a

    thorough overview of the challenges associated with BC

    adoption in IoT, point out the open issues and possible

    solutions, and suggest promising research directions

    2. Scope of the survey

    We begin our review with a study of the prevalent

    centralized IoT architectures and discuss their security vul-

    nerabilities. We identify five primary security tasks, evaluate

    them against centralized solutions, and determine their

    limitations and the need to shift to decentralized solutions

    such as Blockchain. We then discuss the fundamentals of

    Blockchain. The working of the SCs have been excluded,

    and instead, their security vulnerabilities and applicability

    has been discussed. Considering the vastness of BC appli-

    cability, especially in IoT security, we shortlist a pool of re-

    cent survey papers (2019-early 2022) and comprehensively

    highlight their key focal points. The research papers have

    been shortlisted based on keywords, the number of times

    cited, and relevance to one of the five domains- General

    IoT security, IoT suitable CMs, BC-based IoT applications,

    BC for B5G applications, and integration with Machine

    Learning and BC- Edge computing. Other researchers may

    find this pool useful as a starting point for their research.

    Based on our secondary survey, we broadly discuss the

    reason for merging BC with IoT, how BC is a key enabling

    technology for IoT and what technologies drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in

    IoT. We have discussed three enabling technologies for

    powering BC adoption in IoT- EC, IPFS, and ML. We

    then discuss the BC-IoT integration in great detail and

    present the technicalities of BC adoption in IoT. Since a

    BC network is only as good as its consensus, we conduct

    a detailed comparative analysis of CMs in light of IoT

    goals and related tradeoffs. Based on the study, we shortlist

    IoT suitable CMs and BC platforms. We then review the

    recent BC-based IoT architectures and evaluate them against

    the previously identified security tasks. We have filtered a

    subset of research papers(2018-early 2022) where the focal

    points are specifically the five IoT security tasks mentioned

    in subsection 1(A). Each paper’s experimental work and re-

    sults have been carefully studied, and the aim, architecture,

    pros, and cons of each solution have been comprehensively

    summarized. Finally, based on the literature review of BC-

    100

    IoT architectures, we thoroughly discuss the challenges in

    BC-IoT integration and present research issues and future

    research directions.

    3. Security vulnerabilities of Centralized IoT applica-

    tions:

    IoT’s centralized architecture has three major network

    components-a) End devices: These are devices with sensing

    and actuating abilities coupled to the CPS. They amass

    data in the environment that they are lodged in and take

    action. b) Gateways and Data acquisition systems (DAS):

    DASs acquire data from sensors, and the gateways enable

    the Device-Cloud interactions working on different network

    protocols. c) Computing platforms: The data is relayed

    to platforms that provide storage, processing, hardware,

    software, and analytical support to the system.

    A. IoT Goals

    IoT architecture must satisfy the following primary

    goals:

    1)

    Low Power consumption: IoT devices are con-

    strained and require low-powered communication

    protocols to increase the network’s lifetime.

    2)

    Adaptability: The addition of new devices, frequent

    changes in the network conditions, and mobility of

    devices are essential factors in an IoT network. IoT

    architecture must be flexible to changes that the

    network encounters.

    3)

    Interoperability: Heterogeneity is a prime character-

    istic of IoT data. Well-defined standards and middle-

    ware are necessary to ensure ubiquitous computing.

    4)

    Latency prevention: The data processing must be

    done in a timely manner, especially in critical ap-

    plication domains.

    5)

    Accuracy: The data must be consistent and accurate

    throughout the process. The veracity of the data must

    be ensured, and the communication should be non-

    lossy.

    6)

    Fault tolerance: The architecture must contain a

    distributed and decentralized system to ensure ro-

    bustness and resilience.

    7)

    Security protection: Data must be protected against

    malicious cyberattacks. The transmitted data must

    not be altered at any level.

    8)

    Privacy Preservation: The transmitted data must only

    be available to the users participating in exchanging

    information.

    9)

    Low cost: The overall cost of deployment, network

    communication, storage, and maintenance should be

    low. Affordability is an essential factor in making

    IoT a viable business paradigm.

    10)

    Scalability: IoT is an ever-growing field. New de-

    vices are added to expand the existing networks. The

    architecture must be flexible to the growth of the

    network

    1) IoT Security Goals

    An IoT network must satisfy the following security

    goals:

    1)

    Confidentiality: Data transmitted must be accessible

    only to authentic users. Encryption mechanisms must

    be employed to protect the data.

    2)

    Integrity: The data transmitted must be trustworthy.

    The data received must not be modified in an unau-

    thorized manner.

    3)

    Availability: The data must not be lost in transit. DoS

    must be avoided.

    4)

    Authenticity: The data must originate only from

    trusted sources only. The Authentication issue in-

    cludes the capability to identify the devices in the

    IoT-based system.

    5)

    Non-Repudiation: The data transfer must be bound

    by proof of data ownership. The sender and receiver

    must acknowledge the transfer of data and not deny

    it at a later stage.

    6)

    Authorization: This refers to granting permissions to

    access data or perform an operation on authenticated

    objects and persons.

    B. Security of Centralized IoT applications:

    The number of IoT applications has increased signifi-

    cantly as a result ofthe development of open-source cloud

    platforms, such as Azure IoT Suite, Amazon Web Services,

    and Oracle IoT. IoT is at the root of various critical applica-

    tion infrastructures such as Smart Home, Smart City, Smart

    Health, Smart Agriculture, Smart Retails, Supply Chain

    Management, Finance, Industrial Control Systems, Commu-

    nication Networks, Smart Grids, and Smart Transportation

    [7]. These applications generate personal and sensitive

    information, raising the need for secure DM. Centralized

    schemes are susceptible to attacks, and a hacker can modify

    the AC policies to gain control of the system. Decentralized

    schemes are necessary for securing IoT Applications. The

    centralized nature of the application is vulnerable to various

    security threats at all levels, as depicted in Figure 2. In this

    subsection, we discuss six critical application domains:

    Figure 2. Security attacks in IoT

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    101

    1)

    Smart city (SCT): SCT has Information and Com-

    munication Technology (ICT) at the core of its

    infrastructure. SCT provides several innovative and

    advanced services to its citizens to improve their

    quality of life. Intelligent information is provided

    to its citizens in real-time by fully enabling the

    control of the physical objects. Various SCT appli-

    cations include Healthcare, Smart buildings, Public

    safety, Smart Governance, and Smart agriculture.

    SCT faces large-scale security and privacy risks. The

    resource-constrained devices used, such as sensors

    and cameras which collect and share sensitive infor-

    mation, are very vulnerable to attacks by hackers.

    Most of the resource-constrained devices have no

    adequate security or privacy mechanism. The com-

    munication technologies used by IoT devices like

    RFID, NFC, WiFi, LPWAN (Low Power Wide-area-

    network), 6LoWPAN 3G,and 4G mobile technolo-

    gies are highly susceptible to attacks. The presence

    of multiple links between many system components

    exposes them to many security risks [8], [9], [10].

    2)

    Smart HealthCare (SHC): One of the major do-

    mains in the IoT-based infrastructure is SHC. Wear-

    able and mobile devices in IoT-based SHC have

    added tremendous value to the healthcare domain.

    SHC is responsible for making healthcare person-

    alized, more convenient, and efficient. The various

    applications of SHC include assisting diagnosis and

    treatment, health management, disease prevention,

    risk monitoring, virtual assistants, smart hospitals,

    and assisting drug research. SHC is highly vulnera-

    ble to security breaches and faces many malignant

    attacks, including privacy leakage, data tampering,

    and forgery. SHC deals with sensitive and personal

    data. The data collected through sensors are both

    static or have dynamic behavior. The breach of such

    data is considered a severe breach in data protection.

    The connected devices capture, aggregate, process,

    and then transfer the data to the cloud. These devices

    are vulnerable to tag cloning, spoofing, RF Jamming,

    and cloud polling. SHC has a centralized dataset that

    contains personal information such as family history,

    electronic medical records, and genomic data that

    must be secured from malicious software. Wireless

    networking technology deployed in the healthcare

    environment like Wi-Fi, BLE, and ZigBee results

    in an increased threat of eavesdropping, sybil, and

    sinkhole attacks [11], [12], [13].

    3)

    Smart Grid (SG): SG constitutes one of the most

    critical applications of the IoT. SG entails integrating

    the data communications network and the power

    grid to analyze the data collected from transmission

    lines, distribution substations, and consumers. The

    transmission and distribution of the power networks

    in SG are intelligently monitored at a fine granularity

    for high accuracy. Several IoT architectures have

    been proposed to be integrated with SG. Layer 1

    architecture consists of the Smart meters, Network

    Devices, and Communication protocol in the general

    three-layered architecture. Layer 2 contains devices

    responsible for receiving data at the central system.

    Layer 3 includes artificial intelligent systems to

    provide information to decision and billing systems.

    IoT-based SG as a cyber system faces security

    challenges at all three levels. The attacks can be

    categorized into four main types: Device attack, Data

    attack, Privacy attack, and Network availability at-

    tack. Authentication, user privacy, and data integrity

    are essential in SG. Only the intended recipients

    must access the data stored or transmitted. Secure

    authorization and control access is an important issue

    for IoT-based SG. Only a certified and authorized

    person should be granted the necessary access to

    perform any configuration of the smart meter [14],

    [15], [16].

    4)

    Smart Home (SH): An IoT-based SH refers to the

    environment of living that consists of highly intelli-

    gent and advanced automatic systems. Smart services

    are provided by various heterogeneous electronic

    devices networked together to provide smart ser-

    vices. An IoT-based SH performs various function-

    alities such as controlling and monitoring lighting,

    home temperature, appliances, intrusion detection,

    and energy management. Convenience and secu-

    rity are considered two key factors influencing the

    decision of the users in adopting IoT-based SHs.

    An SH must satisfy five security goals- Authenti-

    cation, Authorization, Integrity, Confidentiality, and

    Availability. SH faces many security-related issues

    owing to its basic architecture, such as eavesdrop-

    ping. An attacker can capture the traffic in infras-

    tructure among the different components of SH,

    thus violating confidentiality. The data captured can

    lead to an impersonation attack where an adversary

    masquerades as an authentic user and accesses IoT

    resources. DoS attacks can be performed by crafting

    malformed messages, resulting in provided service

    not processing the data properly, thereby compro-

    mising the availability [17], [18], [19].

    5)

    Smart Farming/Agriculture (SF/SA): IoT-based

    SF solutions refer to the system in which the crop

    field is monitored with the help of sensors, and

    the irrigation system is automated. The monitoring

    of the farm can be done from anywhere by the

    farmer. In IoT Smart Agriculture (SA), far advanced

    sensors are utilized, connected to the cloud via

    cellular and satellite networks. Thus the real-time

    data received assists in making effective decisions.

    However, there remain many security and privacy

    issues which are critical to the performance of

    SA/SF. Wireless sensors are used abundantly in SA

    to give up-to-date information to the farmer in real-

    time. Centralized systems store the information and

    have control over it, compromising the privacy of

    the system. Furthermore, communication plays a key

    role in SA/SF. The vulnerable nature of wireless

    102

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    technology results in the interception of data packets.

    The data is susceptible to modification while relaying

    them to their destinations, compromising the CIA

    triad and leading to incorrect decision-making [20],

    [21], [22].

    6)

    Smart Transportation: With the rapid develop-

    ment in smart sensors, smart vehicles, and vehicular

    communication technology, the Internet of Vehicles

    (IoV) is proposed to be the future of the trans-

    portation critical infrastructure system. The evolu-

    tion of the IoV can be considered from its parent

    branch of IoT, with the focus on Vehicular Adhoc

    Networks. With sensors embedded in the vehicles,

    mobile phones, and the devices installed in the

    city, there is a possibility to offer an optimized

    suggestion of routes, easy parking reservations, eco-

    nomic street lightning, prevention of accidents, and

    autonomous car driving. Due to the dynamic nature

    of the vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to

    vehicle (V2V) communication, the real-time traffic

    state information measured and shared is essential

    in providing efficient and secure service in IoV.

    Since this communication is deployed in an open

    environment and topologies change over time, many

    vehicles enter the IoV system in a given time slot,

    making it challenging to identify and authenticate

    the legitimacy of each vehicle. This nature of the

    IoV network makes it difficult to ensure security and

    non-repudiation. As a result, the malicious attack can

    be easily launched to disrupt the services provided,

    leading to low traffic efficiency and compromising

    the safety of passengers. The high availability of

    IoV is important due to its safety-critical nature,

    which requires fail-safe, resilient, and fault-tolerant

    operations to be performed [23], [24], [25].

    C. IoT Security Tasks:

    The Security tasks can be broadly classified into five cat-

    egories spanning different IoT infrastructure levels. These

    include:

    1)

    Key and AC management: Only authorized person-

    nel must be given access to perform an operation or

    to access data. Fine-grained AC mechanisms must

    be devised in a heterogeneous environment, where

    cross-domain interoperability is a must.

    2)

    Authentication of Devices: It is a must that the

    legitimacy of every node participating in the network

    is proven to the root. The devices must also verify

    their data integrity and provide non-repudiation of

    the messages while interacting with other nodes.

    3)

    Data sharing and Routing security: IoT system pro-

    vides untethered access to information by transmit-

    ting data through uncertain and insecure channels.

    Securing the data and routing operation from cyber-

    attacks during transit is essential.

    4)

    Prevention against software failures: IoT systems

    are susceptible to Malware threats that can disrupt

    the entire functionality of the system. Adware, Ran-

    somware, Spyware protection is necessary to protect

    the IoT ecosystem.

    5)

    Secure and privacy-preserving data storage and man-

    agement: A central authority controls a centralized

    system that has complete control over the users’

    data. IoT systems require secure, tamper-resistant,

    and privacy-preserving database storage and man-

    agement.

    4. Blockchain Technology

    Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger consisting of a

    series of time-stamped blocks linked together through a CM

    forming a decentralized and distributed network [26]. A set

    of rules guides the transactions, and the system is free of

    any central authority. Instead, a peer-peer (p2p ) network is

    responsible for maintaining and updating the ledger. Con-

    ceived originally to prevent the “double-spending” problem

    in commercial transactions, the first widespread application

    of BC was the cryptocurrency Bitcoin’. However, since its

    inception in 2008, BCT has found applications in various

    other sectors such as Banking, Asset Management, Health-

    care, IoT security, Identity management, and Insurance [27].

    The World Economic Forum estimates that the BC would

    store 10 % of global GDP in the coming decade.

    Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that contains trans-

    actional records.The information that is contained in the

    ledger is in digital format. A large number of transactions

    are contained in the block of the BC.For every transaction

    that occurs in the BC, the author’s digital signature is re-

    quired, and every participant’s ledger is updated.By the very

    inherent design of the BC,the chain’s data is highly secure,

    which guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of the

    data.This generates trust without the need for some other

    third party. The validation and tamper-resistant transactions

    are managed by a large number of nodes[28].BC can also

    be described as distributed ledger technology that provides

    certificates to prove that information has not been tampered

    with[29].

    Four crucial technologies are guiding BCT. These include

    Hashing, Cryptography, Digital signatures, and Consensus.

    Hash function takes data of indefinite sizes as input and

    gives a value of definite size in the output. Even a minor

    change in the input leads to a completely different hash

    value. BCT is based on the SHA-256 hash function.The cor-

    responding hash is computed in the encryption block when

    a transaction is made, and the blocks are connected through

    the hashes [30]. For secure interaction, BCT employs

    public-key asymmetric cryptography [31]. Cryptography

    ensures confidentiality, accessibility, and integrity,assuming

    that the attack is computationally bound (the probability of

    which is high). Membership services governed by protocols

    maintain and manage the unique chain identity of the user.

    BCT uses a public key –private key mechanism for the

    identification of devices and signing transactions. A wallet

    contains information about public and private keys and

    tokenized digital assets associated with the client. Every

    transaction on the chain is digitally signed, thus associated

    with the on-record identity of the client.The CM governs

    network synchronization in the open network and ensures

    that the system verifies any transaction initiated. These

    four technologies enable the following in BCT-based open-

    access systems: [32]

    1)

    Decentralization:

    The

    transactions

    are

    validated

    without the interference of a central authority. The

    system is decentralized, and the information is dis-

    tributed and replicated across multiple nodes. The

    nodes agree upon the actual state of the ledger

    through a CM.

    2)

    Auditability: The records and transaction history on

    the chain serves as proof of ownership of the client’s

    digital assets and the transactions associated with

    them. The historical timestamp associated with the

    data is permanently stored in the BC.

    3)

    Integrity: The blocks are linked in chronological

    order with hashes. Thus, any malicious attempt to

    tamper with a block is readily detected.

    4)

    Transparency: BCs impart trust in a trustless environ-

    ment. A copy of the transaction information is visible

    to all the nodes. Any node can join an open BC

    system and access the network. The data is visible

    to everyone in the chain involved in the verification

    of transactions.

    5)

    Immutability:A record, once written, takes up a

    permanent place in the ledger. The ledger holds

    these records perpetually, imparting verifiability in

    the system.

    BCs are of 3 types- Public BCs, Private, and Consortium

    BCs. Public/ Permissionless BCs allow any user to join the

    network based on the consensus protocol, e.g., Bitcoin. Pub-

    lic BC has the capability of turning into a global network.

    A Private/Permissioned BC allows a specific set of nodes to

    be added to the chain providing a closed and more secure

    network [33]. Private BC is centrally controlled, and such a

    network is ideal for transmitting and sharing data within an

    organization. E.g., GemOS is a private BC. Finally, a hybrid

    approach that is partially centralized with lesser validators

    is called a consortium/Federated BC, where the control is

    distributed across a set of computers. Ethereum is a platform

    for building consortium BCs [34]. A comparison of the

    characteristics of the three types of BCs is depicted in Table

    I.

    A. Blockchain Framework:

    A Blockchain system has three layers- Data layer, Con-

    sensus Layer, and Application layer.

    1)

    Data Layer: Data layer governs the block creation.

    Secure identities are provided to each node, and

    dependence is created through network protocols.

    The network protocols govern the formation of p2p

    networks and secure transmission over links. The

    blocks contain two prime components- Chain of

    blocks and Transaction array.

    a)

    Chain of Blocks: BC is a distributed database

    containing a sequence of blocks that stores

    records of value and interest. Each block has a

    Block header(BH) and a Block body(BB). The

    BH stores the block version, which specifies

    the block validation rule set, a nonce which

    acts as a counter to verify the hash, a times-

    tamp to denote time, a Merkle root which

    stores the hash of all the underlying hashes

    of all the transactions in a cryptographic data

    structure called Merkle tree, the current block

    hash and the hash of the previous block. The

    BB contains the transaction data, an object

    recorded on blocks, organized by the Merkle

    tree [35].

    b)

    Transaction array: Every transaction is stored

    in the transaction array before adding it to the

    block. The transactions refer to exchanging

    value assets such as sending money, data,

    values, and messages. The basic skeleton of

    a Blockchain is shown in Figure 3.

    2)

    Consensus layer:This layer performs the core func-

    tionality of a BC system, i.e., bringing agreement on

    the system state in a trustless environment through

    consensus. The consensus is generally achieved by

    choosing a miner who packs the transactions into

    a new block and broadcasts it to the network.

    Figure 4 shows the steps involved in BC-based

    transactions. The four most popular BC CMs are

    Proof of Work(PoW), Proof of stake(PoS), Delegated

    104

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    Figure 3. A basic skeleton of Blockchain.

    Proof of stake(DPoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault

    Tolerance(PBFT). In PoW, the stakeholder(s)/miners

    compete to mine the block by calculating hashes

    until one node has the relevant value. In two

    nodes attaining the value simultaneously(rare) and

    the chain branches, the longest chain after the next

    block is taken as the real chain making the chains

    metastable. PoW requires complex computation and

    power resources. In PoS, a stakeholder/validator is

    chosen through a quasi-random process depending

    on his wallet credit, making the system run on low

    energy and computing resources but encouraging

    the nodes with nothing at stake to misbehave. In

    PBFT, the majority must agree on the network’s

    state, i.e., for a client transaction to commit, 2/3rd

    of the network must validate it. In DPoS, the nodes

    /delegates are chosen through voting to add a block

    to the root chain. In case of abnormal behavior

    by the delegate node, the other nodes can vote it

    out. However, the delegates are significantly less

    than the network and govern consensus, encourag-

    ing centralization. Some more CMs are Proof of

    Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance(DBFT), Proof

    of Burn(PoB), Proof of Capacity(PoC), Proof of

    Elapsed time(PoET), Dirted Acyclic graphs(DAG),

    Proof of Activity(PoA), Proof of Importance(PoI),

    and Leased Proof of Stake(LPoS) [36].

    3)

    Application layer: The Application layer provides

    interfaces for Distributed applications(DApps) that

    run on top of the BC system. At this level, SCs

    are integrated to guide the clauses’ execution with-

    out human intervention. SCs are digitized versions

    of paper-based contracts that allow terms reliant

    on decentralized consensus by self-execution [37].

    SCs are deterministic, autonomous, rule-based, and

    have unique addresses on the chain. The terms in

    the contract are converted into code that gets in-

    voked automatically in case of contract violation.

    SCs identify frauds and malicious attempts in the

    Figure 4. BC-based transactions.

    system, thereby increasing security. The results are

    deterministic and have high accuracy. SCs are in-

    voked independently and autonomously, mitigating

    the transaction costs by reducing human interference.

    Many BC communities are integrating interfaces for

    SCs, e.g., Ethereum provides a platform for writing

    SCs, written in a Turing complete language called

    Solidity [38].

    5. Related Surveys:

    IoT security is a vast domain, and many research and

    survey papers are available in the literature spanning various

    security aspects such as data encryption, intrusion detection,

    active attacks, passive attacks, device authentication, AC

    mechanisms, and channel security. AI and ML have comple-

    mented IoT security in recent times by providing improved

    real-time detection rates and attack detection accuracy. BC

    is a very recent addition to IoT security. BC addition to

    IoT is an up-and-coming solution to augment the pace

    of futuristic secure IoT networks. Due to the vastness of

    the domain and applicability beyond security, exhaustive

    survey papers are not available. Table II presents the recent

    (2019-2022) surveys available in the literature for BC-IoT

    integration. The surveys have been broadly classified into

    BC-based IoT Security, BC-based CMs for IoT, BC-IoT

    applications, BC-ML for IoT, and BC-EC integration. The

    focal points of each survey have been highlighted.

    6. Blockchain as a key enabling technology in IoT

    IoT is the focal point of enabling the pervasive inter-

    connection of virtual and physical objects that have sped

    up data sharing and collection. This capability makes IoT

    one of the essential architectures for providing services in

    various fields. This section discusses BC as a key enabling

    technology for IoT and the technologies that drive BC and

    mitigate the challenges associated with BC adoption in IoT.

    1)

    Addition of BC features: BCT offers unique char-

    acteristics such as auditing capability, traceability,

    immutability, interoperability, accessibility, and ac-

    countability, which are imparted in IoT systems

    with its adoption. The IoT data streams from di-

    verse, heterogeneous environments are transformed

    into uniform coding. BC enables IoT and physical

    systems to collaborate through uniform access, fa-

    cilitating cross-domain interactions [77]. BCs enable

    fine-grained access mechanisms and SCs to prevent

    unauthorized access making the systems open to

    interactions from other physical systems. Further, BC

    has a 160-bit address space higher than IPV6, aiding

    it to be more scalable. The IoT data is stored as

    transactions permanently in an immutable fashion on

    the network. Every transaction initiated by a node is

    associated with the corresponding information. Any

    misbehavior or fraud can be traced back to the user

    imparting the audit capacity in the system, which can

    highly complement IoT verticals [65].

    2)

    5G and 6G enabled Industrial IoT: The advance-

    ments in faster communication networks are revolu-

    tionizing network services and making IoT systems

    faster. B5G technologies are key facilitators in inno-

    vating futuristic open access with low cross-domain

    barriers. The B5G systems need efficient communi-

    cation mechanisms with enhanced security, robust-

    ness, privacy preservation, and improved mobility.

    5Gs employ network slice brokers to enable media-

    tion between vertical service and resource providers.

    BC can operate independently in slices enabling

    secure and anonymous transactions [4], [78]. 5G ap-

    plications such as 5G-powered drones need security

    and enhanced privacy [79]. Various BC-based solu-

    tions have been presented for securing B5G and 6G

    systems. In [80], the authors present a BC sidechain-

    based decentralized hierarchical scheme for 5G to

    provide secure communication and authentication.

    The authentication is done at the edge of the network

    to reduce latency. In [81], the authors propose a BC-

    enabled clustered architecture for validating blocks

    in IoTs for B5G applications.

    3)

    Enhanced automation with SC applicability: With

    the help of SCs, BC is imparted with decision-

    making capabilities that drastically reduce human

    effort, and the applicability of IoT systems is in-

    creased [82]. The transactional clauses of SCs are

    digitized and tamper-resistant and cannot be mod-

    ified. SCs eliminate the need for an intermediator,

    minimizing management costs. SCs detect breaches

    and misbehavior in the system and automatically

    take decisions depending on the clauses pre-agreed

    upon by the system’s stakeholders. The decisions

    have higher accuracy and reliability and improve

    the overall security and efficiency of the system.

    SCs make distributed access decisions to enable

    legitimate users to query the BC and work better with

    data-driven interactions. SCs are deterministic and

    autonomous, thereby accelerating the inception of

    Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs). In

    IoT systems, SCs facilitate flexible AC, secure DM,

    prevent DDoS attacks, and provide secure identity

    management, strengthening security further.

    The three primary driving forces for BC-IoT adoption

    are:

    1)

    Edge computing: EC is a major driver for IIoT, and

    the integration of BCT into edge provides enhanced

    reliability, privacy, data integrity, reliable AC, and

    automated resource allocation. Conversely, the edge

    networks provide computational, storage, and side

    chain-based consensus facilities to IoT devices [70].

    Due to the constrained nature of IoT end-devices,

    they communicate data to the edge where the mod-

    erately intensive CMs and functions are done. The

    nodes store partial data such as time-stamp informa-

    tion to validate the authenticity of the other nodes.

    At the same time, the complex functions, strong

    CMs, and high storage requirements are offloaded

    to the edge. Various architectures have been present

    for BC-based edge computing. In [83], the authors

    propose a mobile BC-assisted IoT application con-

    sisting of Small cell base stations with mobile edge

    computing (MEC) deployed at them. In [84], the

    authors present a prototype for BC-based EC for

    mining and edge resource management for mobile

    BC. In [85], the authors present a DPoS based double

    auction cross-server edge resource allocation frame-

    work for mobile EC. BC functionality can be further

    extended for network management by designing BC-

    based Software-defined networks [32].

    2)

    Integration with ML: BCs provide secure data

    storage, and the outputs can detect anomalies in

    IoT systems [86]. The integration of ML and BCT

    in IoT can enable various tasks such as - secure

    storage of correct data, monetization of ML skill set

    through SCs, feeding correct data into algorithms,

    creation of better learning models through incentive-

    based competitive modeling, Making BCs secure

    from attacks, enabling automated signing of BC

    systems [71], [87], [88], [89]. In [90], the authors

    proposed a BC-assisted collective learning method

    to guide the secure exchange of learning results

    at the IoT edge. The model employs BC on the

    top of the edge devices where the nodes securely

    share learning results using BC-assisted collective

    adopted in the rest of the deep neural networks.

    3)

    IPFS powered BC for IoT: In critical IoT sys-

    tems, distributing data in a tamper-proof and trace-

    able manner is necessary. BCs provide the service,

    but they work inefficiently while handling big data

    considering the transactional processing limitations.

    IPFS can complement BC and provide a secure

    storage mechanism for IoT data. IPFS is a content-

    addressable, p2p version-controlled file system that

    can assist the formation of a decentralized IoT

    system [91]. IPFS, based on cryptographic hashes,

    is a potential alternative to address BC big data

    issues. BC is duplicated on multiple nodes; thus,

    most storage spaces are required without immediate

    use, particularly if the node operator does not need

    to examine every file saved on BC. With IPFS, BC

    only saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down

    the chain development drastically because hashes

    are typically less than the data they represent. For

    example, if SHA256 is employed, the on-chain stor-

    age required for a file of any size is lowered to 32

    bytes [92]. For any modifications in the content, the

    hash value changes each time. The authors of [93]

    offer a decentralized IIoT data management system

    108

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    based on BC and IPFS. The authors of [94] propose

    a network architecture that uses BCand IPFS to

    provide IoT data privacy. SCs perform AC in the

    proposed “modular consortium” architecture while

    also providing accountability for data owners and

    third parties to whom users grant access.

    7. Blockchain Integrated IoT systems.

    IoT aims to design a distributed system offering scalabil-

    ity, security, privacy, reliability, real-time data delivery, and

    high adaptability. With the rapid advancements in B5G, IoT

    systems are becoming faster, expanding over longer ranges,

    and requiring enhanced security solutions. BC has distin-

    guished intrinsic features of non-intermediation, immutabil-

    ity, data transparency, and tamper-resilience, which mitigate

    security concerns in an untrusted cross-domain open envi-

    ronment. BCs are envisioned as the future of open-access

    systems requiring distributed storage, efficient data and

    resource management, secure KM, and AC mechanisms. By

    design, a BC-based architecture can ensure confidentiality,

    integrity, availability, user control, and authorization in any

    system [95]. The integration of BC into IoT offers increased

    data trust, imparts verifiability, eliminates intermediation,

    provides transparency, and increases user control of the

    user data in the systems. IoT and BC’s collaboration can

    resolve the issues of data organization, data maintenance,

    communication security, intra-domain collaboration, and

    privacy in IoT. We shall refer to such systems as BC

    integrated IoT (BIIT) systems throughout the rest of the

    paper.

    A. Technicalities of Blockchain IoT integration:

    The world is moving towards becoming “smart” with

    IoT technology, necessitating more attention to data security

    and privacy concerns. IoT security solutions are typically

    complicated due to a lack of safe hardware and software

    design, development, limited resources, and established

    standards. Furthermore, the diversity of resources available

    in the IoT has hampered efforts to develop a comprehensive

    global strategy for protecting IoT systems at all levels. The

    main challenge is data management and securely providing

    services without compromising the privacy of the underly-

    ing personal information. One of the IoT security solutions

    is to develop a fine-tuned AC mechanism for data protection

    and privacy by ensuring that only authorized and authen-

    ticated users may access data. However, this is hindered

    by the vastness of the connected devices. Furthermore, the

    traffic created by the massive amount of data generated by

    these devices makes satisfying quality-of-service standards

    difficult. loT devices have low storage, computation power,

    and bandwidth restrictions.

    With all of the interactions between people, data, and

    devices, IoT promises direct connectivity between devices

    and data interchange. In the IoT economy, sensors and

    devices should be able to conduct monetary transactions

    in exchange for services without the involvement of a third

    party. With the introduction of the 5G network, transactions

    and exchanges will predominantly occur over the internet

    Figure 5. Interaction between IoT and Blockchain

    network, which billing and payment systems must account

    for. However, financial institutions can still not receive

    real-time information on pledged assets due to ineffective

    management for accessing, sharing, and analyzing asset

    information across stakeholders. There are no chattel asset

    tracking and monitoring systems capable of validating and

    quantifying chattel assets pledged for loans.

    BCT has the capability of bringing reforms in these sectors

    as it enables safe, immutable, and anonymous transactions

    using a decentralized distributed ledger system. BC-enabled

    loT systems can monitor and track chattel assets in transit

    or warehouses in real-time. The combined approach aids

    in the resolution and avoidance of unnecessary risks in

    the financial industry. Some attacks on loT systems can be

    addressed using BCT. BC research as a security mechanism

    has resulted in various transformative benefits that were

    previously unattainable or unavailable. Figure 5 depicts the

    interaction between IoT devices and BC platforms.

    Figure 6 illustrates a simple BC-based security level

    evaluation mechanism for IoT. The authors of [96] illustrate

    the steps involved in an IoT network based on BC. First,

    IoT device manufacturers pre-verify software that is loaded

    on IoT devices and create the whitelist. A SC is produced

    by combining a manufacturer’s whitelist and the agent’s

    initial agent hash value(IAHV) installed in an IoT device.

    IoT device manufacturers can access SCs via decentralized

    applications or internally through an Application Program-

    ming Interface(API). IoT device manufacturers use SCs to

    update the White List. Manufacturers use the whitelist SC

    to record the whitelist and IAHV of the agent installed in an

    IoT device in the BC. By inquiring about the information

    recorded in the BC via the whitelist SC, the IoT device

    can verify that the agent’s IAHV matches the device agent

    hash value of the installed agent. It validates that the agent

    has not been forged or fabricated by comparing it to the

    agent hash value stored in the BC; as a result, the security

    evaluation process of IoT devices via the agent may be

    trusted. The IoT device’s agent checks to see whether any

    109

    Figure 6. A simple BC-based security level evaluation mechanism

    for IoT.

    untrusted programs have been installed. The agent evaluates

    the security status of the IoT device and transmits it to

    the scoring SC. Manufacturers receive rewards in return for

    updating the whitelist SC.

    1) Recent proposed architectures:

    Two main features of the BCT include Trust and De-

    centralization [97], [98], [99]. By design, the data on a BC

    is secure and tamper-resistant, making it a key disruptor for

    IoT. BCs can be utilized to improve IoT in the following

    ways:

    1)

    Impart data integrity: The nodes in the BC have iden-

    tical copies of the ledger. When transactions occur,

    all network members are responsible for validating

    them, and once verified and stored in the ledger, the

    transaction cannot be manipulated or removed.

    2)

    More Addressing space than IPV6: BC addresses are

    160 bits long, while IPV6 addresses are 128 bits.

    When compared to IPV6, BC has higher addressing

    space (4.3 billion addresses).

    3)

    Trusted accountability: Every operation is docu-

    mented in the ledger; thus, it is possible to identify

    and trace all operations.

    4)

    Fault tolerance: Decentralized systems rely on mul-

    tiple separate components; they are more fault-

    tolerant. Because of the point-to-point decentralized

    structure, BC has no single node failure concern.

    5)

    Eliminating third-party liabilities: BC runs without

    third-party intermediaries and is free of any risks or

    dangers posed by third parties.

    The decentralized. peer-to-peer architecture is the most no-

    table characteristic of BCT. The distributed ledger contains

    Figure 7. Overview of Blockchain –based IoT architecture

    all transactions, and all network members must agree to

    approve the transaction. This feature enables the imple-

    mentation of end-to-end traceability. Data provenance was

    previously difficult to obtain, but it is now a possibility

    with the BCT’s distributed ledger option. Owing to these

    benefits, many BC-based architectures have been proposed

    for IoT; an overview of the same is provided in Figure 7.

    The authors of [100] propose the solutions to overcome

    the centralized solutions and security measures in IoT.

    The data-driven decentralized mechanism is used, which

    provides energy-efficient solutions for detecting attacks on

    the IoT-based Sensor Networks. In [101], the authors aim

    to facilitate the data searching and extraction of public and

    private BCs deployed at the MEC server of the 5G MEC

    smart grid. IoT device identifier is built as a BC explorer.

    In [102], the vulnerability of the massive data produced in

    IoT networks for smart transportation is solved by the BC

    and IoT, which provide a decentralized data management

    system. In [103], the authors propose using the Identity

    Based Encryption (IBE) algorithm to enhance health care

    data security.The BC-based IoT architecture uses IBE to

    provide enhanced security. In [104], the authors address

    the privacy, security, and scalability issues in a centralized

    system for IoT and resolve them with a lightweight archi-

    tecture for BC-based identity management. In [105], Mobile

    edge-cloud computation offloading is used in delay-sensitive

    IoT applications. An effective, trustworthy access control

    mechanism is introduced, which involves an advanced deep

    reinforcement learning algorithm using a double dueling

    Q-network. The work in [106] proposed using BC, SCs,

    and IoT devices to integrate different kinds of IoT devices

    in pre and post-harvesting agriculture segments. This work

    in [107] proposes the integration of the Software-Defined

    Network with the BC system. A BC-based architecture is

    used for proposing the new routing protocol witty cluster

    structure for the IoT networks.

    B. Tradeoffs in Consensus mechanisms for IoT suitability

    BIIT systems:

    Consensus is the principal mechanism that makes the

    BCs secure by design. A CM governs the rules that pivot

    on the network’s nodes to agree on the ledger’s true state.

    Consensus achieves trust in a heterogeneous, uncontrolled

    environment by providing a mechanism to validate the data

    communicated by the nodes in the network. CMs eliminate

    the central authority, validate the data communicated by

    the nodes in the network, establish trust among nodes and

    ensure a system state agreed upon by the network members.

    With the increase in BC-based applications, various CMs

    have been proposed and adopted by systems, but their adop-

    tion is met with challenges. The choice of the consensus

    algorithm significantly affects the network’s performance,

    and there exists a tradeoff between scalability, energy

    consumption, bandwidth requirement, network overheads,

    computation overheads, security, privacy, and latency.

    The robustness of a BC-based system is highly dependent

    on its underlying CM. The security provided by a CM

    is directly proportional to computational and bandwidth

    requirements, as is the case with PoW. IoT’s computational

    and communication abilities are bound by constrained re-

    sources; thus, applying a generic CM in IoT is difficult.

    Inter-domain cross consensus poses additional challenges

    [108]. Over the past few years, CMs have been customized

    particularly for LW environments. Since IoT networks are

    constrained, the CMs have been modified over the last

    few years to increase their suitability in LW networks.

    This, however, comes at the cost of compromising security

    and other factors. CMs with strong fault tolerance and

    immunity to attacks require the computation of intensive

    hash operations that consume energy, bandwidth, and other

    resources. CMs that work on low power do so at the cost of

    decreasing the network’s size or moderately compromising

    data integrity. An ideal CM for IoT would ensure increased

    decentralization, adversity tolerance, scalability, throughput,

    and decreased latency, energy consumption, storage, com-

    putation, and network overheads.

    A comparative study of the existing CMs in light of IoT

    goals is presented in Table III [109], [58], [55], [53] and

    [60]. The values High, Moderate, and Low under different

    columns(to different methods) are assigned based on dif-

    ferent criteria. For the energy consumption, computational

    resource requirements, storage overheads, and Throughput,

    the values are assigned bydirect comparison with PoW

    and IoT suitability. The numerical criteria for assigning

    latency values is Block creation time. For example, the

    block creation time in PoW is approximately 10 minutes,

    while it is only 4 minutes in PoC. Although the time is

    considerably lower than PoW, it is still not suitable for

    real-time IoT environments, and compared to other CMs

    that take only seconds, the time taken by PoC is high.

    Thus, the value “Moderate” has been assigned based on

    the combined criteria. DPoS can process 100,000 TPS, and

    the block is added in under 3 seconds to the chain, which

    is still not suitable for real-time IoT systems that require a

    block creation time of the order of milliseconds.

    While designing a new consensus algorithm for an LW

    system, the following tradeoffs need to be considered:

    1)

    Security and Computational requirements: Strong

    cryptographic methods provide high security and

    decentralization to the system, and improve data

    integrity and confidentiality but are computationally

    intensive and require high power systems for imple-

    mentation.

    2)

    Privacy and Latency: To achieve privacy, the adopted

    system should be free of a central authority, and

    the consensus should be achieved in a p2p fashion.

    However, private chains are adopted by systems that

    encourage centralization to decrease the system’s

    latency, thereby increasing privacy concerns.

    3)

    Convergence rate and Adversity tolerance: The con-

    vergence of the algorithm affects the adversity tol-

    erance of the network. For IoT real-time systems,

    for the consensus to converge faster, the number of

    nodes involved in consensus is decreased, making it

    easy to compromise the network and decreasing the

    system’s fault tolerance.

    4)

    Latency and Scalability: For cross-domain access,

    the number of validations to perform transactions in-

    creases, increasing the network overhead. To reduce

    latency in real-time applications, the number of the

    communicating nodes needs to be capped.

    5)

    Throughput and Scalability: As the network size

    increases, simultaneous communication attempts to

    access resources and Block addition increase con-

    siderably. This affects the system’s throughput sig-

    nificantly as more nodes access the limited resources

    of the system

    1) BIIT suitable Consensus mechanisms and Blockchain

    platforms:

    1)

    Hyperlegder Fabric with PBFT: Hyperledger fab-

    ric has a modular architecture and can create private

    chains. The system’s latency is less but is associated

    with significant network overhead, suitable for small

    private networks, limiting the network’s scalability.

    Hyperledger fabric is suited for private networks,

    works on PBFT, and has a pluggable CM. To achieve

    consensus, the majority of the nodes must agree

    on the block addition. For writing SCs, the frame-

    work supports the “Go” language and “Chaincode”

    [135]. The framework provides data confidentiality,

    efficient processing, and identity management and is

    suitable for low-scale IoT implementation.

    2)

    Hyperledger Sawtooth with PoET: Designed by

    Intel, this framework is suitable for low-powered

    systems. The nodes solve a hash problem, and

    the winning node is chosen randomly on a ran-

    dom waiting time using Intel’s softguard extension.

    The contracts on Sawtooth can be written in any

    language, and various CMs can be plugged into

    the same chain [136]. It usually employs PoET,

    which offers low computational requirements, High

    for permissioned and permissionless BCs and pro-

    vides features such as live data streams suited for

    IoT environments. The framework, however, suffers

    from Security and Privacy issues.

    3)

    IoTa with Tangle: Tangle is a distributed communi-

    cation protocol that does not work on transaction fees

    suitable for IoT. Tangle enables a parallel transaction

    verification mechanism which decreases the conver-

    gence time and reduces latency in the system. How-

    ever, the framework suffers from storage and security

    problems and is prone to centralization. IoTa uses

    DAG, which minimizes the system’s network and

    transaction overhead [132]. The latency is low and

    has been specifically designed for IoT applications.

    Iota enables high throughput but does not support

    SCs and suffers from privacy issues.

    C. Security architecture of BIIT systems

    BCT is evolving as a key paradigm in addressing these

    issues of IoT. In BIIT systems, BC is added at the security

    level and works on a distributed consensus scheme where

    each IoT transaction is verified, and every message can be

    traced to the origin. BIIT systems work in a p2p distributed

    manner, and each entry is time-stamped. The data blocks

    are integrated using cryptographic hashes, and the Merkle

    tree stores all atomic transactions. The tree’s root hash is

    verified to secure all the transactions underlying it.

    To understand the BIIT system’s security mechanism, the

    Hyperledger fabric for IoT BC security architecture has

    been considered, consisting of five levels: [137]

    1)

    Perception layer: The IoT node layer collects the

    data from heterogeneous environments and is pre-

    processed, transformed, and stored on BCs.

    2)

    Network Layer: All nodes are given equal priority

    and transmit the data. Each node contains the data

    authentication protocol information and block net-

    work mode.

    3)

    Consensus layer: The layer works on the PBFT

    algorithm, suitable for constrained IoT environments

    because of less energy consumption and lower com-

    putational overhead.

    4)

    Smart Contract Layer: The SC layer stores contracts,

    incentive mechanisms, and other scripts. SCs are set

    up in the certification authority.

    5)

    Application Layer: The layer is responsible for col-

    lecting, storing, verifying, and processing the data

    blocks. The IoT application interface enforces the

    node transaction process and provides AC services.

    Mechanism: The devices are registered and granted AC

    rights which are defined in the SC. Various sensing devices

    collect data of various types and in varying formats. This

    data is pre-processed, and preliminary information is ex-

    tracted through a hash function and asymmetric encryption.

    The heterogeneity is removed by transforming the data into

    a fixed-length base to keep a uniform format. The data is

    time-stamped, stored in a block, and broadcasted to the

    whole network. The gateway nodes hash the data, storing

    the table in the block. The time-stamp archives the key

    block information such as the source, and digital signature,

    which imparts traceability. Any node can act as a miner to

    carry out authentication. A block node validates the received

    data according to the data structure, source, time-stamp,

    and other information. The data from a legitimate source is

    added in chronological order, and the transmission from

    a malicious node is restricted. The data is stored in an

    immutable fashion on the chain.The IoT transactions are

    verified using a PBFT consensus algorithm, ensuring that

    no false data is stored on the system. The SCs are triggered

    in case of an event, and the contract clauses are invoked to

    handle the misbehavior by one or more nodes. SCs enable

    cross-domain interoperability by implementing scripts for

    various states. The SCs also eliminate human/third-party

    intervention for invoking the rules in case of a malicious

    attempt. At the top, application services are provided, and

    access rules for cross-domain interactions are maintained.

    The architecture has five prime advantages-Improved secu-

    rity, increased cross-domain interoperability, data integrity,

    data traceability, and automated decision making.

    8. BIIT systems and IoT Security tasks

    More and more devices are being connected in the

    IoT application domains with advancements in sensing and

    actuating technologies. Verifying the legitimacy of the com-

    ponents for secure communication, authentication schemes,

    and secure routing protocols (RP) are essential criteria in

    IoT sensor networking. In Table IV, the literature study of

    the recently proposed security architectures of BIIT systems

    has been summarized vis-`a-vis security tasks identified in

    Section 3.3.

    A. Primary Study of the BC Solutions:

    In [138], the authors propose a BC-based distributed KM

    scalable architecture with fine-grained auditing capability

    for hierarchical AC. The architecture consists of 3 main

    components- A device layer containing the CPS devices,

    a BCT-based security access manager (SAM) network at

    the fog layer, and multiple BC networks on the cloud

    for KM. The user keys are secured and not under the

    control of a key generation center, and the information

    is instead stored on the SAMs, which act as the miners

    on the chain employing a PoW consensus algorithm. The

    information is offloaded to a BC-based cloud for access

    across multiple domains and reduces the blocks’ burden.

    The cross-domain operations are allowed after the cloud

    manager verifies it and sends it to the SAM. In the case of

    frequent accesses, the information is stored in the BC with

    the same deployment domain. The target difficulty in the

    model is 17 bits for a SAM device, and the average time

    consumption decreases with transaction collection time (Tc)

    with the assumption that there are enough power resources

    to carry out the verifications. The performance evaluation of

    the model for cross-domain operations shows that the time

    consumption in carrying them out is the same during each ½

    Tc period. The architecture provides fine-grained auditing,

    but its performance evaluation runs on various assumptions,

    such as that all the management domains have the same

    number of user equipment. The mining is done after the

    propagation procedure ends, and the SAMs have the same

    transmissibility to propagate transactions and mining time.

    In [139], the authors propose a theoretical architecture for

    BC-based AC mechanisms with enhanced trust mechanisms

    and increased portability. The architecture consists of 3

    prime layers- Resource layer (RL), BC layer (BL), and

    Application layer (AL). The model aims to formulate an

    AC mechanism for defending against attacks in an untrusted

    environment. The model adopts the PBFT algorithm for

    consensus, an endorser makes endorsements for the trans-

    action, and a transaction handler executes the chain codes.

    Users communicate with ALs through a client application

    for registration and requesting AC. BL is at the core and

    is deployed on every component in the private network.

    It consists of 3 components – web controller, transaction

    handler, and ledger. All the actions such as identity creation,

    executing access protocol creation, and resource creation

    happen in the BC. All the requests are saved in the BC in an

    immutable and non-resistant manner. The model’s security

    analysis shows resistance to AC message tampering until at

    least 1/3 nodes of the network is not compromised. The

    model is suitable only for the low-scale implementation

    and is compromised if the network complexity increases,

    creating latency and storage problems.

    In [140], the authors propose a BC-based AC mechanism

    for verifying IoT end-points and providing access tokens

    for querying resources. The architecture is gateway-based,

    where IoT devices communicate with the gateway instead

    of the internet, and conversely, any communication to

    IoT devices goes via gateways. The gateway serves four

    purposes- protocol bridge, AC, secure communication, and

    proxy BC. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) act as the

    gateway approver, vendor device authentication is done by

    the vendors, and the gateway acts as an authorization server.

    The AC state is distributed across all nodes and stored on

    the SCs. A trusted administrator does the SC deployment,

    and signing of ISPs and vendors. The AC is carried out in a

    few stages- gateway authentication done by an ISP, vendor

    authentication of devices by the owner under each domain,

    and the gateway handles outside requests by verifying and

    granting access requests. The outside requestors need to

    build secure channels with gateways before communicating

    to IoT for access. The ISPs are discredited in case of

    untrusted behavior, and the domain owner has complete

    control over the requests coming through the gateway. The

    model is evaluated over trust, security, and performance.

    The security analysis shows that the attacks can happen

    if the attacker leverages massive computational resources,

    which are costly or compromise the approvers, mitigated by

    using a certification authority for vendors. The architecture

    is centralized and needs a trusted intermediary. The authors

    argue that IoT systems cannot be entirely decentralized and

    employ trusted approvers for authenticating end-points. The

    architecture relies on ISPs to route traffic carrying security

    verifications, while BC provides validation.

    In [141], the authors propose an SC-based data sharing and

    AC mechanism for end-point communication in IoT devices

    to resolve trust issues. The proposed system consists of

    SCs for DM in an untrusted environment. Three SCs are

    used – Access control contract (ACC), Register Contract

    (RC), and Judge Contract (JC). ACC maintains the AC for

    any requester and oversees the overall communication AC

    and data sharing between IoT devices. RC is responsible

    for the authentication of requests and registers them. The

    behavioral analysis is done by JC, which checks the node

    for misconduct and generates alert messages. An ACC

    is invoked when an AC request is sent, and the request

    is forwarded based on the access permission level. After

    objects accomplish the request, the corresponding transac-

    tion is stored on the chain. The security analysis shows

    that the proposed system is open access and secure, and

    the trustworthiness is maintained throughout using SCs.

    The model is evaluated against cost and shows that ACC

    event and query-based services. The device is assigned

    to a private group, and subsequent permissions are given

    through a delegation mechanism performed by a BC. The

    architecture consists of low-powered IoT devices, powered

    user devices with computation and storage capacity, an

    application manager for user interface and registration, an

    IoT manager for data filtering and query management, a BC

    Manager (BCM) for SCs and AC management. The BCM

    registers the IoT devices and deploys an SC for each device.

    BCM allows delegates to activate or deny the permission

    stored in the SC. The SC stores devices’ platform hashes

    and delegation policies. The BC miners verify before any

    permission activation. The proposed model is for private

    networks for increased throughput and reduced latency, but

    the model cannot be replicated on large-scale IoT systems

    without affecting the network performance.

    In [143], the authors propose a BC-based privacy-preserving

    and rewarding private data sharing scheme, a BC-based

    incentive mechanism for private data exchange.The data

    owner publishes private data and receives a payment anony-

    mously in the BC, while data consumers obtain licenses

    anonymously through SCs, where licensing technology en-

    sures access control for multi-sharing. The authors leverage

    Monero technology to ensure the untraceability and un-

    linkability of DUs while getting private data, ensuring that

    no one can develop a dat user behavior profile database.

    The authors incorporate the non-frameability characteristic

    into the anonymous incentive data sharing scheme. Honest

    data consumers can refute the frame up using a deniable

    ring signature without revealing their genuine identity. The

    authors present the security model, provide the formal secu-

    rity proof using the random oracle model, and demonstrate

    the model’s feasibility in real-time IoT architectures. The

    authors have proved the effectiveness of their technique and

    compared it to various undeniable ring signature schemes.

    The results reveal that the computational cost increases

    linearly as the number of ring members increases.

    In [144], the authors propose an efficient BC-assisted secure

    cross-domain device authentication mechanism, inducing

    inter-domain trust and privacy in IIoT applications. Identity-

    based signatures induce authentication in this mechanism,

    and privacy is induced by designing the identity manage-

    ment mechanism. The cross-domain authentication privacy

    perseverance also introduces a key negotiation mechanism

    to prevent eavesdropping on the insecure channel by negoti-

    ating session keys. The architecture consists of four layers.-

    Entity layer(EL), Agent layer(AL), BC Layer (BCL), and

    Storage Layer(SL). EL consists of a key generation center

    (KGC) and IIoT devices. KGC is responsible for the gener-

    ation of private keys for IIoT devices. AL consists of the BC

    Agent Server (BAS)and Authentication Agent Server(AAS).

    The model employs three types of authentication- Unilateral

    authentication, where users authenticate a device, Mutual

    authentication, where two devices authenticate each other;

    and cross-domain authentication, carried by KGC, BAS, and

    AAS. The domain-specific information is encapsulated into

    the consortium BC node in transactions and is acquired

    by other domains for authentication. The authentication

    agent server executes signature generation and verification

    operations on behalf of requesting devices. With an increase

    in the number of endorsing and validating nodes, the BC

    consensus time increases, introducing latency in the system.

    In [145], the authors proposed an out-of-band two-factor

    authentication scheme to prevent impersonation attacks on

    large-scale IoT devices using “device relationship” and

    BCT. The out of band performs the secondary authentication

    to distinguish home IoT devices from the malicious IoT de-

    vices. There are four components of the said authentication

    scheme- Authentication Subject(AS), which is any device

    that wants access to resources, Related Device(RD) that

    performs secondary authentication, BC that stores the ‘Re-

    lationship information’ for every authentication subject with

    the related device and Authentication Executor (AE) which

    coordinates the two factors out of band authentication. A

    relationship contract stores the mapping of AS address

    to ‘Relationship data’. When an AS requests access, AE

    retrieves the corresponding information from the BC, selects

    the RD in the AS neighborhood, and sends the correspond-

    ing action sequence. The corresponding RD invokes SC to

    send the verification result to BC, and finally, AE checks

    BC for verification results utilizing SC. The model has not

    been implemented on commercial IoT devices due to close-

    sourced hardware and software, and there are considerable

    CPU and memory overheads in the authentication stage.

    In [146], the authors propose a BC-based authentication

    mechanism for the low-power sensor nodes that are part

    of p2p networking using the sequence number of sensor

    nodes. This paper proposes verification through SHA 64-

    bit hash function to confirm confidentiality and integrity

    without compromising performance. The sink node(SN)

    assigns the sequence numbers by a broadcast-response-

    based mechanism for registering legitimate devices. The SN

    keeps a record of the other node’s identity in the form of the

    Ids, sequence number, and hash value; therefore, the sink

    detects a malicious node by verifying the sequence number

    and the hash value. A mutual level node authentication

    model is used where a node and its sequence number store

    all other nodes’ sequence numbers. The node identifies the

    particular node for communication, compares the corre-

    sponding sequence number, and verifies the message by

    comparing the transmitted hash value. Thus neighbors’ hash

    function detects a malicious node and secures the model

    from impersonation. However, as the network complex-

    ity increases, the sink node has to store many sequence

    numbers. Further, the sink node acts as a point of failure,

    and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow other

    malicious nodes to transmit the messages.

    In [147], the authors propose an authorization and au-

    thentication mechanism for LW IoT devices that improve

    the IoT network’s performance. The proposed mechanism

    is based on the public BC mechanism and uses a fog

    computing network to achieve the desired task. The system

    architecture is divided into two layers: the device layer

    and the fog layer. The device layer consists of the many

    low-powered and low computational devices responsible for

    generating the data in the network. The IoT devices can

    116

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    be grouped depending upon the customized functionality

    they perform. The fog nodes in a particular group perform

    the same functionality. On the other hand, the fog layer

    is a BC-enabled fog device connected to the internet for

    working together. The fog nodes perform the CM execution

    to validate the transactions and create the blocks. The

    mechanism proposes three phases -The initialization phase

    consists of registering the system and devices with the

    closest BC-enabled fog nodes. The device authentication

    phase involves authenticating the devices with the BC-

    enabled fog node by mapping the system ID, device ID, and

    public address. Device-to-device communication involves

    the secure transmission of the message between the same

    system’s fog nodes or different systems. Before the device-

    to-device communication, both the devices are authenticated

    by the BC-enabled fog node. After that, a block is created

    in the BC, and subsequently, a secure channel is established

    between the devices. However, this mechanism assumes that

    fog nodes and admin are trusted and that communication

    between fog devices and nodes is secure.

    In [148], the authors propose a node authentication model

    for the IoST(Internet of Sensor Things) based on the BC

    mechanism. The base station validates any node’s creden-

    tials whenever it performs any action in the network.The

    authors have employed identity authentication with PoA

    as the consensus approach to reduce computational costs.

    The miners are pre-selected, and following the authenti-

    cation request, the registered nodes are authenticated.The

    request contains IDNode(Node ID), MACAddrNode(MAC

    address), and ReputationNode(the reputation value assigned

    to a certain node based on its previous history in the

    network ), which are already stored on the BC. The au-

    thentication is carried out by comparing the credentials of

    nodes previously stored in the BC. The BC determines

    whether or not the credentials provided by nodes match

    the credentials currently stored in the BC. If the credentials

    match the information provided, the nodes are authenticated

    and broadcast as legitimate nodes. A SC is deployed on the

    base stations that track all the network transactions. The

    system model is predicated on two assumptions: Firstly,

    base stations are accepted as legitimate and provide secure

    services to consumers, and secondly, symmetric keys are

    securely transferred in the network.

    on

    BC-enabled

    fog

    nodes

    that

    inter-

    face with Ethereum SCs to authenticate users to access

    IoT devices.The major stakeholders include Administra-

    tors(responsible for controlling access permissions for IoT

    devices), End users(interested in requesting an IoT de-

    vice service), Fog nodes(for localized storage), and cloud

    servers(storing IoT data), all having direct access to SCs via

    an Ethereum client in the case of fog and cloud nodes, or via

    a front-end application/wallet in the case of administrators

    and end-users. IoT devices have unique Ethereum addresses

    (with public and private keys), but they lack connectivity

    and do not interact with SCs. The system interactions

    are divided into off-chain and on-chain. In the on-chain

    interactions, the admin constructs the SCs, registers the

    IoT devices, maps them to a fog node, and may grant

    end-users access to certain IoT devices. The SCs check

    the list of authorized users, and the user receives a SC

    acceptance token which it uses to authenticate itself off-

    chain. The authors have provided the security analysis of

    the architecture,but the cost analysis of utilizing Ethereum-

    based SCs is unaccounted for.

    In [150], propose a decentralized BC-based architecture

    with SCs to allow edge computing nodes to store IoT

    data and securely interact with one another.The archi-

    tecture is composed of 4 layers- Information aggrega-

    tion layer(consisting of IoT-like devices), Edge computing

    layer(consisting of edge devices with fair computation capa-

    bilities), Service supporting layer(responsible for provision

    of services), and Application layer.The collaboration with

    other edge computing nodes must first be certified by the

    edge computing nodes, which will result in the exchange of

    MicroCoins(introduced cryptocurrency) between members.

    The model uses a publish-subscribe mode, allowing users

    to access data across domains. The users or application

    developers first subscribe to the data publisher from the

    edge computing node pool for data exchange. The data

    publisher then supplies the subscription data and submits

    a transaction to the BC-enabled SC to manage the pre-set

    business model while providing the required data. The au-

    thors introduce a new CM called Proof-of-Edge computing

    to reach consensus among all edge computing nodes and

    avoid centralization. All corresponding operations must be

    documented in BC to obtain self and other domain audits.

    In [151], the authors propose integrating Network Function

    Virtualization(NFV), software-defined network(SDN), and

    BC to create a flexible and reliable routing architecture

    for IIoT. SDN and NFV are responsible for creating pro-

    grammable forwarding devices that create the network’s

    optimal routing policies. The controllers are secured using

    BCT and take decisions and collect the data from the

    nodes to detect mistrust. A secure path is acquired by

    adequately removing the malicious node from the IIoT

    network by periodic monitoring and collecting network

    data. Each controller has a distributed ledger, and malicious

    nodes are identified by calculating the network’s trust value

    during behavior authentication stored in the BCs. The

    synchronization reaches a consensus among various ledgers

    transmitted through a control channel. Different controllers

    handle routing requests through an access point. The exper-

    imental evaluation shows that the model outperforms the

    state-of-the-art systems in average delay over attacks and

    packet loss rate. However, the frequent calculations of trust

    values lead to substantial computational power, bringing

    overheads in the system, which must be addressed without

    compromising the model’s security.

    In [152], the authors propose a routing protocol for the

    wireless sensor network that uses BCT to make routing

    more efficient and secure. The nodes present in the network

    are treated as the coins, and the routing path for the message

    is treated as the transaction, which is subsequently added to

    the BC. Initially, all the nodes are owned by the sink and

    considered inactive, and the rest are active. When an event

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    117

    occurs, the nodes access the BC to find the optimal path to

    the sink. Dijkstra’s algorithm obtains the message’s optimal

    path by a cost function determined by signal and interfer-

    ence. This optimal path is the transaction to be added to the

    BC and transmit the message after eliminating malicious

    nodes detected by the BC security mechanism. The routing

    process is made secure by trusted cryptographic algorithms

    such as ECDSA224 and SHA512. While transmitting the

    message to the sink, the node seeks the ‘ownership’ of

    the path’s nodes transferred back after successfully sending

    the message. However, the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages. Complex calculations are involved in

    finding routes that increase the computational overhead and

    network cost.

    In [153], the authors propose a BC-assisted secure routing

    algorithm for a network based on 5G new radio for the

    swarm Unmanned Aircraft System(UAS) to prevent the

    disruptive attacks committed on UAS networking. The BC

    performs two main functions -Selecting the secure next

    hop for transmission of a packet from one to another

    and the authentication and verification of UASs. The BC

    distributed updated block digests to the whole swarm after

    a UAS is authenticated. The BC used is LW, which is

    different from the conventional BC distribution. Instead of

    using conventional mechanisms, the traffic status of UASs

    is leveraged to achieve a consensus known as Proof of

    Traffic(PoT). The neighborhood of UAS is decided based

    on the destination and record of the digest in BC, and each

    UAS in the swarm delivers packets to its neighbors with

    beamforming. The block digest records are checked so that

    the unauthenticated UAS are not chosen as hops. The attack-

    ers need the specific BC digest to launch an attack, which is

    computationally very expensive. PoT employs the passive

    broadcast for block synchronization, unlike conventional

    algorithms, which reduces the system’s overheads suitable

    for LW environments. However, the model assumes that the

    hackers cannot compromise a UAS in joining the swarm

    UAS networking. The untrusted UAS cannot recuperate

    the signal with side lopes leakage of beamforming without

    directional transmission.

    In [154], the authors propose a malware detection technique

    in IoT devices using Deep Learning (DL)and BCT, where

    SCs detect malicious applications. SC guides users’ and

    end-developers’ interactions, stores information about new

    apks, and enables tracking of malicious apps on the net-

    work. The malware features are shared and trained on DL

    models in android IoT devices. After the user uploads an

    app to the network, it is stored in an IPFS where the DL

    models extract features. The hash values obtained from the

    training models are stored in an immutable fashion on a BC

    network to prevent decompilation and repacking attacks by

    reverse engineering methods. When a user downloads a new

    app, the user sends the hash to the network for verification,

    where an SC decides whether the app is malicious or not.

    The model has been evaluated on 18,850 android appli-

    cations and 10,000 malware android packages and shows

    considerable efficiency. However, the analysis of bandwidth

    consumption by the IPFS based storage is not given, which

    is important, especially in the case of metered connections

    In [155], the authors propose a BC-based framework for

    detecting malware in mobile applications before down-

    loading. The model relies on dynamic and static analysis

    for detecting malware. The model uses two external and

    internal BCs. The internal private BC(IPB) contains feature

    extractors(FEs) to extend the dedicated internal private

    BC(DIPB). FE extracts information during the lifetime of an

    app. These features can be static, extracted from the file, or

    dynamic and extracted by monitoring the run time behavior.

    Each FE component is connected to a DIBP that tracks

    each app using the behavioral information. A dedicated

    external private BC(DECB) for each application contains

    scanning information of application versions. A determinant

    agent(DE) is part of the BC and based on the data in the

    BC, it classifies the app as malicious or not. DEs attach their

    decisions to DEPBs with relevant information. Although

    the dedicated BC for each app reduces the computational

    burden of one BC, it also increases the system’s overall

    complexity.

    In [156], the authors propose a distributed anti-malware

    protection mechanism to support a hybrid signature and

    anomaly-based detection model. When a new file is added,

    the users make a signed hash of the file corresponding

    hash is sent to the BC ledger. The verification is done on

    signature-based detection, and the system process and ports

    are checked for malicious activity. However, the signature-

    based verification suffers from detection evasion if the hash

    of the malicious file is changed. To avoid this, if the hash

    comparison does not match, a notification is sent to the

    users, and the system process and network ports are con-

    tinued to be examined. If any suspicious activity is found,

    the file is blocked from self-executing. The BC is updated

    with the hash of the malware file detected. This can prevent

    DDoS attacks where the malicious app may attempt to gain

    access to IoT devices. However, the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but not for resource-constrained IoT

    devices.

    In [157], the authors propose a three layer parallel dis-

    tributed architecture for storing and sharing IoT data-

    BC layer, Node layer, Distributed storage layer aimed to

    improve the scalabilty of BC-based systems. The data

    generated by IoT devices is encrypted, and the hash value

    of the data is generated and stored in the BC as its unique

    identity. BC is the system’s control layer and is responsible

    for validating transactionsand data access control and also

    provides a platform for SCs to support various applications.

    The raw data is encrypted locally and stored in multiple

    storage nodes across the distributed network using the

    Kademlia method so that the data host has no access to

    the original data. The encryption technique used is AES

    (Advanced encryption standard). The data owner adds a

    digital signature to the data block’s digest, allowing the

    data’s ownership to be authenticated. The efficiency analysis

    reveals that in a network of 2n nodes, retrieving any data

    requires a maximum of n steps.

    118

    In [158], the authors propose a BC-based solution for the

    decentralized storage mechanism and secure data transmis-

    sion, in this case, a sensing image, in IoT networks. This

    paper proposes using an encryption algorithm for secure

    data transfer and an intelligent verification algorithm for

    data storage and signature verification. A blocking algo-

    rithm is employed for sensing an image, and an intelligent

    sensor divides the image using image sensing and block

    data partitioning. A public key generation algorithm is

    leveraged, and the smart image sensor securely transmits

    the key information to BC. The sensor signs the data

    blocks with different keys at different intervals and transmits

    the message to the server, where a signature verification

    algorithm is employed. If the signature is verified, the data

    block is stored. The theoretical analysis shows that the

    model is resistant to counterfeit, theft, replay, and DoS

    attacks. The BC uses only one public key to authenticate

    different blocks, reducing the cost, but the intelligent sensor

    calculates n+1 keys for n blocks and stores n keys.

    In [159], the authors propose a theoretical prototype of

    BC-based IoT architecture using a design science research

    approach. The approach aims to design a prototype for data

    center decision-making, simplicity, complete digitization,

    tamper resistance, heterogeneity, and authentication of BC

    data. The Raspberry Pi is configured as a client node

    for the Ethereum BC, containing the storage and compu-

    tational configuration layer. The model has three prime

    components- IoT data logger(senses the data), SCs (stores

    data, chain address of the devices, and records events),

    and the monitoring dashboard component(displays data to

    end-users, communicates with the SCs, and behaves as a

    mining node). The system considers Ethereum BC, where

    SCs are executed on a virtual machine to reduce costs. The

    accounts on Ethereum are classified as contract (contain

    balance and contract storage executed via a transaction sent

    to its unique address)and externally owned(refer to external

    agents and contain only balance). The prototype is designed

    for high data availability, parsimony, and modularity in

    IoT ecosystems essential for efficient DM, but the design

    encounters high operational costs and scalability issues.

    In [160], the authors propose a trusted DM scheme for

    sensitive data distribution and storage in EC. The ar-

    chitecture is divided into three layers- Edge device(Fog

    nodes), BC Network(to which data is committed), Edge

    nodes(provides services), and Cloud center layer(complex

    problem solving). BlockTDM is reliant on a multi-step mu-

    tual authentication scheme based on certificates. A modified

    PBFT - broadcast multi-signature-based CM is employed

    where a client commits the message to the endorsing

    pairs (EPs) and the management pair(PM). PM verifies the

    signature, the endorsing pairs simulate, and the result is

    broadcasted to an ordering service peer and delivered to

    the bookkeeper. A multichannel matrix-based architecture

    is considered for data protection for blocks on different

    channels and user-defined data encryption for interchannel

    security. The scheme employs Hyperledger Chaincode as

    an SC connected to the EPs and is invoked to process

    transactions and query over the protected BC data. SCs are

    designed for data of various kinds, such as multimedia and

    documents, to support specific block DM. The model is

    highly secure but has O(n2) communication complexity.

    In [161], the authors propose a BC and Deep reinforcement

    learning(DRL) based scheme for efficient DM to achieve

    high-quality data collection with limited mobile terminal

    (MT) energy resources and sensing range and secure data

    sharing in Industrial IoT. The model proposes collecting the

    data through a DRL approach fed to the BC network. The

    connection of each MT is validated, and data is encrypted

    using keys and digital signatures. BC integration ensures

    data security and reliability when MTs share data and

    prevents the systems from attacks. Multiple Ethereum nodes

    are distributed across a private chain that interacts with the

    SC deployed on the chain. A certification authority is set up

    to maintain the data’s reliability and authenticity to avoid

    fraudulent transactions by MTs. The model is tested on the

    severity of DoS and DDoS attacks, and it is that DDoS

    attacks have a 0.1 % worse impact than DoS attacks. The

    increase in MTs does not impact the network, but both

    the attacks affect the database as the transaction frequency

    increases affecting the data storage.

    1) Critical Analysis of the proposed architectures:

    The evaluation of these studied techniques reveals that

    a tradeoff exists between IoT security and other perfor-

    mance criteria. Most of the proposed frameworks have been

    carefully verified against several security metrics, but the

    cost issues for customers or businesses are not addressed.

    The model in [145] cannot be implemented on commercial

    IoT devices due to close-sourced hardware and software,

    and there are considerable CPU and memory overheads in

    the authentication stage. In the architecture presented in

    [146], the sink node has to store many sequence numbers

    as the network complexity increases. In [151], the frequent

    calculations of trust values lead to substantial computational

    power, bringing overheads to the system. In [152], complex

    calculations are involved in finding routes that increase

    the computational overhead and network cost. In [154],

    the analysis of bandwidth consumption by the IPFS-based

    storage is not given, which is important, especially in the

    case of metered connections. In [155], the dedicated BC

    for each app increases the system’s overall complexity. In

    [160], the model has a communication complexity of O(n2).

    Many architectures have ignored or not completely ad-

    dressed the issues of latency, scalability, energy consump-

    tion, computational power, or the security aspect of privacy

    leakage. Most methods restrict to a certain aspect of IoT

    security while ignoring the computational overheads of

    implementation on a large scale. The architecture of [139] is

    suitable for the low-scale implementation, but the network

    performance is compromised if the network complexity

    increases, creating latency and storage problems. The model

    is resistant to AC message tampering until one-third of

    the network is not compromised. The proposed model in

    [142] is for private networks and cannot be replicated

    on large-scale IoT systems without affecting the network

    performance. The architecture proposed in [144] suffers

    Int. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 13, No.1, 97-129 (Jan-2023)

    119

    from latency issues when the number of endorsing and

    validating nodes increases. The design in [159] encounters

    high operational costs and scalability issues.

    The authentication, trustworthiness, and authorization in

    many BC-based architectures are achieved through SCs,

    introducing transactional costs. In [141], ACC consumes

    high execution and transaction energy. In [149], the security

    analysis is provided in-depth, but the cost analysis of

    utilizing Ethereum-based SCs is unaccounted for. Many

    architectures provide security but are not suitable in con-

    strained environments. In [156], the proposed mechanism

    is suited for servers at the application layer for personal

    computers and servers but cannot be replicated for IoT

    devices.The architectures are not truly decentralized and

    run on some form of central scheme and are prone to

    security issues. In [146], the sink node acts as a point of

    failure, and a legitimate node can become corrupt and allow

    other malicious nodes to transmit the messages. BC-based

    systems incur high storage costs too. In [161], the increase

    in MTs does not impact the network, but both the attacks

    affect the database as the transaction frequency increases

    affecting the data storage.

    Many architectures rely on assumptions that may not be

    practically true. The architecture presented in [138] runs

    on various assumptions, such as that all the management

    domains have the same number of user equipment, the min-

    ing is done after the propagation procedure ends, the SAMs

    have the same transmissibility to propagate transactions and

    mining time and that there are enough power resources to

    carry out the verifications. The architecture of [148] runs on

    the assumption that base stations are always legitimate and

    that symmetric keys are securely transmitted in the network.

    In [147], the mechanism assumes that fog nodes and admin

    are trusted and that communication between fog devices and

    nodes is secure. In [152], the model assumes that all nodes

    are homogenous and that the sink has enough resources to

    handle the messages.

    B. Security benefits of BIIT systems :

    Despite the limitations, there are significant benefits of

    BIIT systems. The information created by IoT frameworks

    is broadly significant and confidential, and BCT substan-

    tially increases the security in distributed networks. BIIT

    systems offer the following security merits:

    1)

    Data integrity and confidentiality: The transactions in

    BIIT systems are verified through a CM, and all the

    nodes have an identical copy of the ledger. The data

    and transactions are highly encrypted by leveraging

    cryptographic mechanisms intrinsic to the BC.

    2)

    Data provenance: BIIT systems offer traceability by

    keeping a historical record of the timestamp in the

    BC.

    3)

    Fault tolerance: In BIIT systems, the data is dis-

    tributed across multiple devices, and a single node

    failure does not disrupt the system’s functionality.

    This eliminates a single point of failure and makes

    the BIIT systems more robust than centralized IoT

    systems.

    4)

    Secure communication and resistance to attacks: CM

    prevents the malicious nodes from corrupting the

    system. Launching an attack requires leveraging high

    computational resources.

    5)

    Trust management: BCs bring trust in the commu-

    nicating nodes and, through SCs, provide rules that

    guide a user’s authorization. SCs invoke clauses in

    the event of mistrust and penalizes the user for the

    breach.

    6)

    Access control: BIIT systems provide uniform access

    across multiple IoT systems. In BIIT systems, the

    IoT device is coupled with a unique identifier, and

    efficient KM and AC mechanisms for interoperability

    are available.

    7)

    Removing third-party risks: BCs decentralize the

    structure authority and provide secure DM with a

    decentralized architecture. Thus, the data is not under

    the control of a private organization but distributed

    across a plurality of nodes.

    BIIT systems offer higher security than centralized IoT

    architectures. A comparison is given in Table V.

    9. Challenges, Open Issues, and Research Directions:

    BCT is emerging as a key paradigm for establishing

    trust, imparting security, auditing capability, and verifia-

    bility in systems. BIIT systems are secure but require a

    scalable architecture with sufficient throughput and low

    latency. IoT systems are constrained, and designing less

    intensive security measures for low-powered devices with

    low storage, computational, and network overheads are in

    progress. The constrained nature of IoT and other factors

    hinders the deployment of BIIT systems, briefly discussed

    below:

    1)

    Cost of IoT storage through SCs: In Ethereum SCs,

    the amount of computational work required to com-

    plete an operation in a transaction is measured in

    Gas units. The currency to pay for Gas units is Ether/

    gwei (1 gwei= 10-9 ethers). There is no fixed price

    set for the gas, and the sender enforces a gas limit

    in the transaction and specifies the gas cost. Miners

    mine the blocks which specify high gas prices. The

    price of Ethereum has risen from a single-digit USD

    value in 2015 to touching 2500 USD in 2021 [162].

    Suppose a transaction requires 100 million gas units

    with 1 gas unit set at 25 gwei; the corresponding

    price in dollars to complete the transaction would

    be 108x25x 10-9x2500=6250 USD. With more de-

    vices in the network, data storage complexity also

    increases. BCs store an immutable, permanent record

    of data, and with the increase in the nodes, the

    size of the chain also increases, which causes stor-

    age/memory concerns. Although BC eliminates the

    management costs in a system, it is considerably

    expensive to store data in a BC. Ethereum costs

    76000 USD per GB, which is very expensive for

    120

    IoT applications. The research is moving towards

    cost analysis and solutions for IoT storage through

    BC SCs. In [163], the authors investigate the storage

    costs of numeric data on BC through SCs. The data

    storage is conducted using two strategies. In scenario

    1, the data is stored in an array, and in Scenario

    2, the data is encoded into one variable using two

    methods- Encoding within SC and encoding outside

    SC. The experimental results show that encoding the

    data outside SC into one variable is cost-efficient

    compared to storing data in an array or encoding it

    into a variable within SC.

    2)

    Power consumption: IoT devices applyenergy-saving

    strategies such as “Sleep and Wake up” scheduling

    to increase the network lifetime. However, due to

    BC’s unique way of storing and continuous data

    processing, the energy consumed by such a system is

    considerably higher than conventional systems. The

    authors in [164] estimate the energy consumption of

    various cryptocurrencies. The processing power is

    measured in hash rates. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 and

    has a rated power network of 4291,366 KWwhich an

    IoT node cannot support. Mining is computationally

    expensive, which necessitates specialized machinery

    and massive quantities of electricity.It is challenging

    to run BC as a full node on IoT devices. Recent solu-

    tions suggest using edge computing to enable mobile

    devices to offload the mining work to the cloud.

    Edge computing can be incorporated to help mobile

    devices offload mining work to cloud resources.

    The authors in [165] propose a 4-layer BC-based

    framework for IoT where the devices and servers

    participate in BC via p2p communication. The end

    devices handle simple operations while more pow-

    erful servers support the complex operations in the

    top tiers at the edge/cloud.

    3)

    Network model in BC systems: The expansion of

    the BIIT system creates new requesting blocks. The

    requesting block and the state data must lead to

    a consistent system state, and the newer clients

    synchronize with the existing state. The majority

    of the BC-based traffic models are p2p. The au-

    thors of [55] categorize it into three types- Gos-

    sip Protocol, Kademlia Algorithm, and DAG. The

    gossip-based BCs offer relatively less latency and

    energy consumption but achieve data integrity at

    the cost of large message overheads [166]. The

    Kademlia algorithm works with lesser communica-

    tion overhead, and the resource location in DAG is

    guaranteed. Ethereum also employs p2p networking

    with no trusted intermediary. The nodes themselves

    act as the service and the service providers to en-

    sure data synchronization [167]. Ethereum follows

    a discovery protocol that allows the nodes to find

    each other. BlIT systems must satisfy consistency

    in an asynchronous network with reduced latency

    and increased security. The security of consensus

    depends on the underlying network. Studying the

    network extensively to determine what affects the

    performance of a p2p network is an important issue.

    In [168], the authors study the network structure

    of Ethereum by running a customized version of

    Ethereum’s Go client, GETH, for seven months.

    4)

    BC Security and Privacy vulnerabilities: BC-based

    systems provide high security to systems by making

    data tamper-proof. However, BC itself exhibits secu-

    rity vulnerabilities. The adversity tolerance is further

    reduced with modifications in CMs for LW environ-

    ments. Common security threats to BC include Pro-

    tocol attacks, Ellipse attacks, the chance of double-

    spending, Consensus protocol attacks, SC Vulner-

    abilities, Programming frauds, Private Key Leak-

    age, DDoS attacks, and other security issues[169],

    [170]. Employment of communication security pro-

    tocols such as Datagram transport layer security

    is resource-intensive and not suitable. Further, all

    transactions in the BC are transparent. By analyz-

    ing the patterns of transactions from a user, the

    anonymity of a user can be compromised and lead to

    potential front-running. For private communications,

    protocols such as Telehash or Whisper can be inte-

    grated. Privacy leakage can be countered through pri-

    vacy protection mechanisms such as Zero-knowledge

    proof, Attribute-based Encryption [171]. However,

    these cryptographic algorithms are highly resource-

    intensive and unaffordable in LW environments.

    5)

    SC Vulnerabilities: A fault in the SC could be caused

    by a simple typing error, a misinterpretation of the

    specification, or a more severe programming error.

    BC is irreversible, and a minor glitch has many

    ramifications for SC security and functionality. For

    example, the quantity of gas that the transactions

    contained in the block can utilize is limited to

    prevent the chains from growing beyond a point. If

    data is stored in variable-sized arrays and accessed

    through loops, the gas can get exhausted before

    committing a transaction. Miners are compensated,

    but the transaction is reversed. As a result, testing

    mechanisms for SCs is a critical problem. The test

    mechanism must inspect the SC on enough data

    for all malicious and non-malicious inputs before

    deployment to detect anomalies. Furthermore, be-

    cause IoT systems are distributed across multiple

    locations, retrieving data from various sources can

    cause the SCs to become overburdened. It’s difficult

    to fine-tune SCs for IoT LW applications. SCs are

    associated with a variety of other challenges. The

    legal enforcement of SCs, for example, is currently

    restricted. Dual integration of SCs with real-world le-

    gal contracts is one solution that has been proposed.

    6)

    IoT specific Consensus: The abilities of the existing

    CMs are limited when applied to IoT and have not

    been tested thoroughly. Conventional CMs, such as

    PoW, is resource-intensive and cannot run on IoT

    devices. Even a powerful IoT node such as Rasp-

    berry pi3 can only achieve 104 hashes per second,

    122

    Sadia Showkat, et al.:Securing the Internet of things through Blockchain approach.

    while a Bitcoin network can conduct around 1019

    hashes per second. Integration of full BC nodes in

    IoT is in the nascent stage. Malicious attacks on

    lightweight CMs with low adversity tolerance can

    prevent valid transactions. A potential solution is

    to limit the consensus to the edge / decentralized

    cloud, while IoT nodes save only the hash values,

    but this increases the storage overheads on the edge.

    Furthermore, the interoperability and authentication

    standards for edge devices are limited.

    7)

    Throughput, Latency, Scalability, and Network com-

    plexity:BC systems do not scale well if the network

    size increases massively. The network efficiency re-

    duces as the network scales up and more authen-

    tication requests are handled, leading to network

    congestion. The growth of the chain further leads

    to bandwidth problems. The mobility of IoT devices

    also affects BC performance. BCs are inherently

    latency tolerant, and the mining time is induced to

    secure the networks further, which is unacceptable

    in real-time IoT systems such as IoV. A poten-

    tial solution is to integrate IPFS, AI, and ML to

    complement the BC. Off-Chain solutions can be

    integrated to increase the transaction throughput.

    IoT big data is posing challenges in real-time data

    delivery. Integration of ML in BIIT systems for IoT

    Big data analytics is hindered by storage, latency,

    scalability, and other challenges. Further investiga-

    tion is required to analyze the overheads introduced

    in BC-IPFS integration. Normalization and compres-

    sion techniques explicitly designed for BIIT systems

    where BC power is leveraged are required.

    8)

    Compatibility and Adoption: BC is an emerging

    technology and lacks standardization laws. Access

    control legislation is an issue in public BCs. IoT data

    is heterogeneous, and the diversity of IoT devices

    implies the need for different network protocols. Pro-

    tocol conversions to enable smooth communication

    are especially costly in BIIT systems. The large-

    scale adoption of BIIT applications needs significant

    infrastructural changes. A generic BC-IoT architec-

    ture is needed to bridge the gap between IoT service

    providers and BC. IoT service providers must modify

    the underlying naming and discovery schemes to

    comply with the BC mechanism. Laws and regula-

    tions concerning information security govern the IoT

    domain, and many countries have strict legislative

    rules regarding cryptocurrencies.

    A. Research Directions

    We present the following research directions based on

    our thorough study of the domain.

    1)

    1. Cost reduction strategies: The rising cost of

    Ethereum is impeding the use of BC in IoT. More

    research into strategies to lower the cost of BC

    adoption in IoT is needed. Given IoT Big data’s con-

    cerns, more efficient data representations that allow

    low-cost SC operations require further investigation

    to make large-scale IoT-BC systems commercially

    viable.

    2)

    IoT-BC Traffic Models: Performing large-scale data

    collection and traffic analysis of growing-BC chains

    is an understudied topic due to large-scale simulation

    and time requirements. The security of the consensus

    protocols is based on the assumption of efficient

    p2p overlay network operations. More research is

    needed to understand the parameters that influence

    the properties of p2p networks.

    3)

    Testing Mechanisms for SCs: The voids in the

    SCs can expose BC security. SCs are vulnerable to

    mining pool attacks because they are open source

    to all parties involved. Once deployed, the SC is

    irreversible and cannot be repaired in the event of

    a virus or a hacking attack. Thus, validating and

    devising unerring testing mechanisms for SCs and

    running them on sufficient data is an important

    research direction.

    4)

    At the Edge Consensus: IoT devices have limited

    computational and networking capabilities; thus, run-

    ning BC as a full node is difficult. It is critical

    to protect IoT suitable CMs from attackers from

    gaining control of the majority of hash power. De-

    signing IoT suitable mechanisms with good adversity

    tolerance and low latency is an open issue and a

    strong research direction.

    5)

    Integration with computing platforms:Due to the

    constrained nature of IoT devices, Fog /Cloud

    servers are added at top tiers, storing the entire BC

    information for transaction validation. It is necessary

    to enable IoT devices to push transactions to the

    BC without centralized block endorsement groups.

    Designing architectures for such integration without

    compromising the security and privacy concerns is a

    strong research direction.

    6)

    Network Configuration: There is no standard archi-

    tecture for BIIT systems. Integration of the cloud

    and the edge at a higher level is critical. Config-

    uring BCs at the node, edge, and cloud levels and

    load balancing and network congestion control for

    addressing increased validation requests are open

    research issues.

    7)

    Convergence of BC and ML: BC-based systems

    can benefit from the addition of MLalgorithms. SCs

    can be used to create a reward-based mechanism

    for training ML models. The potential of ML-BC

    integration has yet to be fully realized, but it is a

    promising future direction.

    8)

    Convergence of BC and IPFS: With IPFS, BC only

    saves the cryptographic hashes slowing down the

    chain development drastically. Through SCs, BC can

    allow access-controlled file sharing and secure stor-

    age of cryptographic hashes of IPFS. It is crucial to

    analyze the latency introduced in the IPFS primarily

    due to the contact with BC and the consequences on

    LW operations.

    9)

    Securing BC and Transactional privacy: Pattern anal-

    ysis of transparent transactions exposes users’ pri-

    vacy. More research is needed to protect BC-based

    AC systems from security threats. Thus, a potential

    research direction is developing LW cryptographic

    algorithms for BCs to protect transactional and user

    privacy in BC-based IoT systems.

    10. Conclusion

    The disruptive attacks on IoT networks are predicted to

    be more severe in the future due to the advanced capability

    of B5G and 6G networks. The unique properties of BCT

    for enabling a p2p network with no centralized stakeholder

    controlling the system enable it to be a perfect security

    solution. BCs, through SCs, provide fine-grained AC by

    providing global functions of authentication, authorization,

    and KM, besides providing a distributed architecture for

    secure storage of hashes, verification rules, sensor data, and

    other information. However, IoT devices are constrained

    and require an LW implementation of CMs to bear the

    computational, storage, power, and network overheads. This

    paper presents a comprehensive comparison of BC solutions

    for IoT systems and concludes that BC can provide efficient

    KM and AC, node authentication, routing security, and se-

    curely store the domain-specific information. A detailed sur-

    vey of recent research on security enhancement, consensus,

    applications, integration with ML, and computing platforms

    is presented. We discuss IPFS, ML, and EC can facilitate

    BC as a crucial enabling technology for IoT. Through IPFS-

    enabled BCs, the growth of the chain is restricted by only

    storing hashes on the BC, and the AC list is maintained

    by SCs, enforced by the updated IPFS software. MEC is

    being considered to be a potential approach for achieving

    consensus for mobile users, facilitating BC applications in

    future mobile IoT systems.

    The convergence of BC and ML for IoT can enable ac-

    curate data analytics. 6G systems are expected to create

    a massive convergence of IoT, AI, EC, Quantum ML,

    and BCT for fast and secure systems that can support

    a plethora of devices. IoT systems are rapidly evolving,

    and as the number of network nodes grows, the tradeoffs

    between energy consumption, security, latency, throughput,

    and scalability become more complex. We conclude that

    BC and IoT technology have evolved separately and for

    futuristic IoT systems to reach their full potential, exten-

    sive research is needed in two domains- a) Blockchain as

    enabling technology in IoT and b)Enabling technologies

    for BC-based IoT. Challenges such as the rising cost of

    Ethereum, power consumption of IoT nodes, SC security,

    and legislation issues are hindering the large-scale adoption

    of BC-based IoT. Extensive research is needed on the

    parameters affecting the network properties, cost reduction

    strategies, encoding, traffic modeling, off-chain solutions,

    network configuration, transactional privacy, SC testing, and

    BC security, especially in LW environments.

    Received: 28 June 2022\nAccepted: 30 September 2022\nABSTRACT\nThis paper addresses\
    \ the urgent need to detect network security attacks, which have increased significantly\
    \ in recent\nyears, with high accuracy and avoid the adverse effects of these\
    \ attacks. The intrusion detection system should\nrespond seamlessly to attack\
    \ patterns and approaches. The use of metaheuristic algorithms in attack detection\
    \ can\nproduce near-optimal solutions with low computational costs. To achieve\
    \ better performance of these algorithms\nand further improve the results, hybridization\
    \ of algorithms can be used, which leads to more successful results.\nNowadays,\
    \ many studies are conducted on this topic. In this study, a new hybrid approach\
    \ using Gray Wolf\nOptimizer (GWO) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithms\
    \ was developed and applied to widely used\ndata sets such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15,\
    \ and CIC IDS 2017, as well as various benchmark functions. The ease\nof hybridization\
    \ of the GWO algorithm, its simplicity, its ability to perform global optimal\
    \ search, and the success\nof the MFO algorithm in obtaining the best solution\
    \ suggested that an effective solution would be obtained by\ncombining these two\
    \ algorithms. For these reasons, the developed hybrid algorithm aims to achieve\
    \ better results\nby using the good aspects of both the GWO algorithm and the\
    \ MFO algorithm. In reviewing the results, it was\nfound that a high level of\
    \ success was achieved in the benchmark functions. It achieved better results\
    \ in 12 of the\n13 benchmark functions compared. In addition, the success rates\
    \ obtained according to the evaluation criteria in\nthe different data sets are\
    \ also remarkable. Comparing the 97.4%, 98.3%, and 99.2% classification accuracy\
    \ results\nobtained in the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC IDS 2017 data sets with\
    \ the studies in the literature, they seem\nto be quite successful.\nKEYWORDS\n\
    Network; attack detection; hybrid; GWO; MFO\n1 Introduction\nNowadays, it has\
    \ become very popular to use machine learning and related techniques to find\n\
    solutions to real-world problems. The main feature of machine learning methods\
    \ is the extraction of\ncharacteristics from a large amount of data without human\
    \ influence [1]. There are many different\nclassification studies that use machine\
    \ learning methods and apply them to real-world problems.\nAutomated classification\
    \ of epileptic Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals [2], anomaly detection [3],\n\
    iris recognition [4] are some of these studies. Network security is also a very\
    \ important issue. The\n1278\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\nevolution of technology\
    \ has increased network security in almost all fields. The continuous increase\n\
    in network traffic and networked systems, while bringing convenience in implementation,\
    \ sometimes\nresults in the measures taken for network security being inadequate\
    \ and creating a vulnerability for\npossible network attacks. The Internet, which\
    \ has become an essential part of our daily and working\nlives, developments in\
    \ Internet technologies, increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology\
    \ in\nmany fields, and Internet-based social networks can be considered as one\
    \ of the main reasons for the\nincrease in network attacks [5]. Various reports\
    \ on network security state that network attacks have\nreached a disturbing level\
    \ of scale and complexity, especially in recent years. Traditional methods such\n\
    as data encryption, user security, and the use of firewalls are used as initial\
    \ security measures, but weak\npasswords or password security breaches do not\
    \ prevent unauthorized use, and user authentication\nfails. However, firewalls\
    \ may also suspect undefined or insecure security policies if there are errors\
    \ in\nthe configuration [6]. In particular, threats to targets such as commercial,\
    \ military, and public network\nsystems have made it necessary to increase cybersecurity,\
    \ and awareness in this area [7].\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) aims detect\
    \ and prevent attacks on the network from inside\nor outside. In IDS, two types\
    \ of systems are distinguished: signature-based and anomaly-based.\nSignature-based\
    \ systems store known and previously seen attack types in the database, while\
    \ anomaly-\nbased systems evaluate real-time packets based on their anomalies\
    \ with regular packets. Various\nmachine learning techniques are used for this\
    \ evaluation [8]. In addition, IDS has some weaknesses.\nThe main drawback is\
    \ that events that do not pose a threat are counted as attacks (false positives),\n\
    while events that pose a threat to the system are not counted as attacks (false\
    \ negatives). For these\nreasons, it is important to interpret the information\
    \ received about the attacks.\nDue to the anonymous structure of the Internet\
    \ and the increasing ease of use, attacks on systems\nhave become relatively easy\
    \ nowadays. The need for IDS is increasing day by day to protect important\nand\
    \ critical data [9]. As computer network attacks and their methods evolve, there\
    \ are new approaches\nto prevent these attacks. In particular, the algorithm used\
    \ is of great importance to find the most\nappropriate solution for network attack\
    \ detection, which is considered as an optimization problem.\nAlgorithms for finding\
    \ the optimal solution are divided into deterministic and stochastic classes.\
    \ In\ndeterministic algorithms, the solution obtained does not change if the input\
    \ value does not change.\nHowever, structural difficulties may arise in finding\
    \ the solution, and the desired solution may not be\nobtained. For these reasons,\
    \ metaheuristic algorithms, which are a nature-inspired type of stochastic\nalgorithm,\
    \ are used. They are easy to construct, can be hybridized with metaheuristic algorithms,\n\
    can be easily applied to different problems, and avoid local optimal values [10,11].\
    \ Metaheuristic\nalgorithms are swarm and population-based algorithms. Examples\
    \ of these algorithms include Salp\nSwarm Algorithm (SSA), Genetic Algorithm (GA),\
    \ Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), and Gray\nWolf Optimizer (GWO). While these metaheuristic\
    \ algorithms have advantages, they also have some\ndisadvantages. Their weaknesses\
    \ are in local search, stuckness, non-repeatable exact solutions, and\nconvergence\
    \ uncertainties. In order to obtain a better solution, hybrid methods should be\
    \ developed\nthat combine successful features by using more than one algorithm\
    \ together [12]. In a developed hybrid\nalgorithm, an attempt is made to eliminate\
    \ the weaknesses of the existing algorithms and achieve more\nsuccessful results.\n\
    In recent years, the topics of network attack detection and prevention have become\
    \ very popular.\nHowever, there are few studies in the literature on how algorithms\
    \ can become more efficient in\nclassifying attacks. When developing a hybrid\
    \ algorithm that uses different algorithms, it is necessary\nto learn more about\
    \ how the solution presented using benchmark functions can work more effectively\n\
    on which types of problems. New studies in this area continue to be of great importance,\
    \ as\nnetwork security and the detection and prevention of network attacks is\
    \ an area that needs constant\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1279\nimprovement. Each\
    \ new study improves on the shortcomings of previous studies and sheds light on\n\
    future studies. For this reason, our work is significant because it applies not\
    \ only to network security\nbut also too many problems that machine learning is\
    \ designed to solve. In this study, a new hybrid\nalgorithm was developed and\
    \ tested with NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC IDS 2017 data sets.\nNSL-KDD one of\
    \ these data sets widely used in the literature is an improved version of the\
    \ KDD\nCup’99 data set. Although this dataset is an improved version of the KDD\
    \ Cup’99 dataset, it has\nlimitations in handling modern attack types. The UNSW-NB15\
    \ and CIC IDS 2017 datasets, which\nhave had these shortcomings further reduced\
    \ and their suitability for today’s attack types increased,\nare also datasets\
    \ that were evaluated as part of this study. To test the generalizability and\
    \ robustness\nof the algorithm developed in this study, these datasets, which\
    \ are widely used in the literature, were\nexamined.\nUnlike many similar studies,\
    \ this study uses a newly introduced hybrid metaheuristic optimization\nmethod\
    \ called GWOMFO to solve benchmark problems and detect network intrusions. GWOMFO\n\
    contains the best features of GWO and MFO. The study aims to develop a new hybrid\
    \ algorithm,\nto show its effectiveness by achieving more successful results than\
    \ existing algorithms, to introduce a\nnew hybrid algorithm into the literature\
    \ so that it can be used on various problems in the scientific\ncommunity, and\
    \ the study is of the original value in this regard. Briefly, the main contributions\
    \ of the\nstudy are as follows:\n• We propose a new structure for network attack\
    \ detection.\n• The proposed hybrid approach is based on GWO and MFO algorithms.\
    \ A hybrid solution is\npresented that achieves higher accuracy by eliminating\
    \ the weaknesses of these algorithms.\n• In the development of a new algorithm,\
    \ the contribution of tests against benchmark functions\nis presented, and the\
    \ developed algorithm has proven its success through successful results on\nthese\
    \ functions.\n• The newly developed hybrid algorithm has been tested on 3 different\
    \ datasets and has achieved\nsuccessful results. The obtained results were compared\
    \ with the studies in the literature and\nshowed that it is a successful algorithm\
    \ with its performance.\nThe remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Related\
    \ works in the literature can be found\nin Section 2, theoretical background in\
    \ Section 3, materials and methods used in Section 4, and\nexperimental results\
    \ in Section 5. Conclusions and future work can be found in the last part of the\n\
    study.\n2 Related Works\nData mining and machine learning in network attack detection\
    \ using various classification\nmethods are now widely used. The main reason for\
    \ this is to detect different attacks and their types.\nFor effective and successful\
    \ attack detection, the classification technique used is crucial. So far, several\n\
    techniques have been proposed to detect attacks and improve existing systems.\
    \ The use of hybrid\nmethods is one of these techniques.\nResearchers continue\
    \ to develop hybrid IDS to detect network attacks. The most important\nreason\
    \ is that a hybrid classifier can improve its ability to detect unknown attacks,\
    \ its threat detection\nperformance, and its detection speed depending on the\
    \ underlying algorithms. This section presents\nsome studies in the literature\
    \ on network attack detection and the limitations of these studies. In\naddition,\
    \ some recent studies on network security are mentioned and information about\
    \ the trend\nis given.\n1280\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\nIn the first of these\
    \ studies, Teng et al. [13] proposed a hybrid method created with a 2-class\n\
    support vector mechanism and a decision tree. In the results obtained, the training\
    \ time is much shorter\nthan the traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.\
    \ However, the detection accuracy of\nunknown or new attacks is quite low. Guo\
    \ et al. [14] proposed a framework consisting of two stages,\nanomaly detection\
    \ and misuse detection. First, network connections pass through stage 1, and if\
    \ an\nanomaly is detected, it is forwarded to the anomaly detection component.\
    \ If it was reported as normal\nin the first stage, it is forwarded to the misuse\
    \ detection component. Clustering and k-NN algorithms\nare used in this structure.\
    \ In the results obtained, 91.86% TPR and 93.29% accuracy were achieved.\nKhraisat\
    \ et al. [15] proposed a hybrid structure using One Class Support Vector Machine\
    \ (OCSVM)\nand C5.0 decision tree classifiers. They found that in this study,\
    \ which aimed at a low false discovery\nrate and high recognition accuracy, they\
    \ achieved quite good results compared to existing studies.\nAhmim et al. [16]\
    \ proposed a new IDS called HCPTCIDS that combines the probability estimates\n\
    of the classification tree. In this structure, which consists of two layers, the\
    \ first layer contains a tree\nstructure and the second layer contains the final\
    \ classifier structure of the first layer, which consists\nof different probability\
    \ estimates. It was found that the proposed system achieves higher performance\n\
    than most studies in the literature. Al-Yaseen et al. [17] proposed a new hybrid\
    \ structure consisting\nof Extreme Learning Machine, K-means Clustering and SVM\
    \ algorithms. It was highlighted that this\nproposed structure significantly improved\
    \ the network intrusion detection results and they stated that\nthey achieved\
    \ 95.75% detection accuracy. Kevric et al. [18] proposed a new hybrid structure\
    \ consisting\nof the combination of 3 different algorithms. In this study, using\
    \ C4.5 decision tree, random tree, and\nNaive Bayes algorithms, it was found that\
    \ the hybrid structure gave better results than the individual\nclassifiers. Aslahi-Shahri\
    \ et al. [19] developed a hybrid method consisting of GA and SVM algorithms.\n\
    They stated that they reached 97.3% True Positive Rate (TPR) in their results.\n\
    The main idea in developing a hybrid algorithm, which is also used in this study,\
    \ is to create a\nbetter combined model and obtain more accurate, better, and\
    \ more reliable results. In another study\nbased on the idea of creating a new\
    \ model by integrating multiple algorithms, Mahmod et al. [20]\nproposed a hybrid\
    \ system based on a multilayer perceptron. In this study, using Multi Layer Perceptron\n\
    (MLP) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms, it was found that the detection\
    \ accuracy of\nnew attacks increased with the increase of food sources and colony\
    \ size, but the success of intrusion\ndetection in multiple classes was low in\
    \ the NSL-KDD. Elbasiony et al. [21] proposed a new hybrid\nsolution based on\
    \ K-means and random forest algorithms for network attack detection. Reviewing\n\
    the obtained results, it was stated that the detection rate and false positive\
    \ rate were better than many\nof the compared studies. Panda et al. [22] proposed\
    \ a hybrid attack detection algorithm consisting of\nrandom forest, decision tree,\
    \ and SVM algorithms to classify network attacks. However, the proposed\ntechnique\
    \ is insufficient to respond to all intrusion attempts. It does not achieve a\
    \ high detection\nrate and a low false alarm rate. Mohamad Tahir et al. [23] developed\
    \ a hybrid intelligent system\nbased on Support Vecor Machine and K-means clustering\
    \ algorithms for network attack detection.\nIn the results studied, it was found\
    \ that they achieved 96.24% accuracy and 3.72% false alarm rate.\nGupta et al.\
    \ [24] developed a hybrid algorithm in their study by combining the ABC and SVM\n\
    algorithm. This study found that the developed hybrid method achieves better average\
    \ accuracy than\nboth ABC and SVM.\nIn general, only the accuracy values are given\
    \ as a result in the studies in the literature. In this study,\nadditional analyzes\
    \ were made on 3 different data sets according to the attack type. Comparisons\n\
    were also made with metrics such as accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), False\
    \ Positive Rate (FPR).\nIn addition to these, calculations were made by keeping\
    \ the number of features low in most studies,\nwhich makes the reliability of\
    \ the obtained result questionable. In addition to these studies, many\nCMES,\
    \ 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1281\nhave appeared in the literature, especially in recent\
    \ years that address network security and provide\nsolutions to security problems\
    \ from various aspects. In recent years, many studies have appeared\nin the literature\
    \ on popular topics such as IoT and Fog/Cloud Computing that address security\n\
    issues. Regarding these issues, Kumar et al. [25] proposed a unified IDS for use\
    \ in IoT environments.\nDepending on the threshold confidence factor, the rules\
    \ created from different decision tree models\nare selected, and the analysis\
    \ of the data set is performed. In this study, using the UNSW-NB15 data\nset,\
    \ they performed better than decision tree models in attack detection rates. Mousavi\
    \ et al. [26]\nproposed a hybrid model using ABC, Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA256),\
    \ and Elliptic Curve\nCryptography (ECC) to improve data security in IoT applications.\
    \ It was found that the efficiency\nof encryption and decryption operations can\
    \ be increased by more than 50% and the execution time\nfor encryption is 52.31%\
    \ lower than the method RSA-AES, when a private key is generated using\nthe algorithm\
    \ ABC. Al-Qerem et al. [27] studied fog/cloud networks. In their study, they propose\n\
    concurrency control protocols for this subject. This study, which aims to reduce\
    \ the communication\nand computation load in fog and cloud nodes, shows that they\
    \ succeed in improving network quality.\nIn another study, Bhushan et al. [28]\
    \ proposed a new approach for flowchart sharing. This proposed\nmethod aims to\
    \ protect Software-Defined Networking (SDN) networks from DDoS attacks with flow\n\
    table overloading. The increased resilience of the network to the flow table has\
    \ also been shown to be\nsuccessful in preventing DDoS attacks. Stergiou et al.\
    \ [29] discussed the issue of privacy and security in\nfog environments. They\
    \ presented a cloud computing-based solution for working with Big Data. In this\n\
    solution, a security wall was inserted between the cloud server and the Internet\
    \ to create an architecture\nto improve network security. Mousavi et al. [30]\
    \ proposed a study for IoT-based irrigation systems. A\ncryptographic algorithm\
    \ is presented to improve the security of these systems. This study highlights\n\
    that cryptography is one of the most important solutions to protect confidentiality\
    \ and integrity\nbetween nodes. Rivest Cipher (RS4), SHA−256 and ECC are used\
    \ in this approach. Summary of\nrelated works are shown below in Table 1.\nTable\

    \ subsections provide the necessary background for hybridization. The most promi-\n\
    nent feature of the GWO algorithm is its social hierarchy. This hierarchy is also\
    \ well adapted for solving\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1283\ncomplex problems.\
    \ However, to increase the performance of the algorithm, hybridization with the\n\
    MFO algorithm was considered. In general, the MFO algorithm can achieve good results\
    \ in finding\nthe best solution, but it is not sufficient to refine the optimal\
    \ solution in each iteration. For this reason,\nit is aimed to improve performance\
    \ by hybridizing with the GWO algorithm. By hybridizing these two\nalgorithms,\
    \ the goal is to arrive at a precise solution and improve the convergence feature\
    \ instead of\nbeing trapped in local optima. GWO and MFO algorithms are examined\
    \ in detail in this section.\n3.1 Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) Algorithm\nThis algorithm,\
    \ which considers the social leadership and hunting strategy of gray wolves, was\n\
    presented in 2014 by Mirjalili [11]. In gray wolves, which generally live in groups,\
    \ groups consist of\n5–12 individuals. Wolves referred to as alpha wolves are\
    \ defined as leader wolves. There are four\nmain groups: Omega, delta, beta, and\
    \ alpha wolves. Alpha wolves are the best wolves, while omega\nwolves are the\
    \ lowest. Alpha wolves are the decision-makers in managing the other wolves in\
    \ the group,\nhunting areas, and sleeping times.\nThe priority in the hunting\
    \ strategy of gray wolves is to find the prey. Then the prey is besieged\nunder\
    \ the leadership of the alpha wolf. Delta, beta, and alpha wolves are used as\
    \ the three best solutions\nfor updating the location of wolves because they are\
    \ believed to provide better information about the\nlocation of the prey [36,37].\n\
    The GWO algorithm is based on the hierarchy of wolves as a model. The best solution\
    \ found is\nalpha, the second and third solutions are beta and delta. The remaining\
    \ solutions are called omegas.\nIn this algorithm, alpha, beta, and delta give\
    \ commands to omega, and omega searches the solution\nspace for these commands.\n\
    In this algorithm, the first step of the hunting process is to encircle the prey.\
    \ Eqs. (1)–(4) used in\nthe mathematical model and their explanations can be found\
    \ below.\nX (t + 1) = Xp (t) − A.D\n(1)\nIn Eq. (1), X represents the position\
    \ of the gray wolves, while Xp represents the position of the prey\nand t represents\
    \ the number of iterations. D is distance from prey. D in the equation is calculated\
    \ with\nEq. (2), and A and C are the coefficients calculated with Eqs. (3) and\
    \ (4), respectively. Using Eqs. (1)\nand (2), the gray wolfs can randomly update\
    \ its position around its prey.\nD =\n\x02\x02C.Xp (t) − X (t)\n\x02\x02\n(2)\n\
    A = 2α.r1 − α\n(3)\nC = 2r2\n(4)\nThe value α in Eq. (3) is a linearly reduced\
    \ value from 2 to 0. It is calculated by Eq. (5). While\nthe TotIter value indicates\
    \ the total number of iterations, r1 and r2 are the values randomly assigned\n\
    between 0 and 1 and used for the optimal solution. During the phase of attacking\
    \ the prey, the value\nof α is decreased and so is the range of change of A. If\
    \ A has random values in the range [−1, 1],\nthe next position of the search agent\
    \ is somewhere between its current position and the position of\nthe prey. Gray\
    \ wolves usually search for alpha, beta, and delta positions. They separate from\
    \ each\nother to search for their prey and come together at the moment of attacking\
    \ their prey. To model\nthe distribution mathematically, the parameter A is used\
    \ with random values greater or less than 1.\nThis makes the search important\
    \ and supports the global search of the GWO algorithm. Alpha, beta,\nand delta\
    \ wolves have good information about the potential location. However, the alpha,\
    \ beta, and\n1284\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\ndelta solutions help the other wolves\

    This algorithm, presented by Seyedali Mirjalili, was developed by exploiting the\
    \ particular\nnavigation behavior of moths in nature, called cross-orientation\
    \ [38]. When the moth moves, it\ndetermines a fixed angle to the moon and flies\
    \ at that angle. This movement enables the moth to\nfly straight for long distances.\
    \ However, if you observe moths, you will notice that they make a spiral\nmovement\
    \ around the light. This situation is caused by artificial light [39]. The extreme\
    \ proximity to\nthe light source and the attempt to maintain the fixed angle with\
    \ respect to the light source reveals the\nspiral trajectory.\nIn the mathematical\
    \ model of this algorithm, the moth cluster is represented by the matrix M. The\n\
    fitness values are stored in an array called AM. At the beginning of the algorithm,\
    \ a moth population\nis assigned at a random location based on lower and upper\
    \ bounds. The flame matrix is updated by\ncalculating the fitness values. It represents\
    \ the flames and contains the best position each moth has\never reached. The flames\
    \ are also updated when the moth finds a better solution. Each moth must\nupdate\
    \ its position with only one of the flames. After each iteration, the positions\
    \ are updated relative\nto the flame. The position of the moths is updated with\
    \ Eq. (13). In the equation given in Eq. (13), the\npositions of the moths in\
    \ the search space are updated based on the logarithmic spiral function.\nS\n\x03\
    \nMi, Fj\n\x04\n= Di.ebt. cos (2πt) + Fj\n(13)\nHere i’th moth Mi, j’th flame\
    \ Fj and distance between moth and flame in each iteration is expressed\nin Di.\
    \ In the equation, t is a randomly generated number between −1 and 1 and b is\
    \ a constant. After\nthe moths are updated, the fitness values are re-evaluated.\
    \ After this process, the best solutions are\nupdated and stored in the flame\
    \ matrix. For the position update process to be more successful and\neffective,\
    \ the number of flames is reduced at each iteration step. The variation of the\
    \ reduction in the\nnumber of flames as a function of iteration, where N is the\
    \ maximum number of flames, is shown in\nEq. (14). The number of flames for each\
    \ iteration can be calculated using this equation.\nFlameNo (N, I, T) = round(N\
    \ − I(N − I)/T)\n(14)\nIn the equation, N expresses the maximum number of flames.\
    \ In other equation expressions,\nl represents the number of iterations, and T\
    \ represents the maximum number of iterations. The\npseudocode of the MFO algorithm\

    \ best solution\n4 Materials and Methods\n4.1 Research Framework\nIn this part,\
    \ the framework of the proposed study, which consists of 5 phases, is presented.\n\
    4.1.1 Data Preprocessing\nThis study used the data sets NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and\
    \ CIC IDS 2017, which are commonly\nused for network attack detection. Usually,\
    \ the data sets contain numerical and categorical data that\nhumans can read and\
    \ understand. However, some machine learning and deep learning models cannot\n\
    handle categorical data. Therefore, normalization and transformation processes\
    \ are performed to\nclean unnecessary data and improve performance. The result\
    \ is a more suitable data set.\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1287\nIn the conversion\
    \ processes, the nominal values in the data set were converted to numeric values.\n\
    One-to-one digitization of the data used label coding and assigned a numeric value\
    \ to each categorical\nvalue. The result of these processes is a data set consisting\
    \ of numeric values.\nIn normalization processes, a linear transformation was\
    \ made on the data by using min-max\nnormalization, and the data was spread between\
    \ 0–1. Eq. (15) used for this process is given below.\nX ′ =\n(X − Min (X))\n\
    (Max (X) − Min (X))\n(15)\nThe min.-max. normalization process examines at how\
    \ far the field value is from the minimum\nvalue and ranks these differences [40].\n\
    4.1.2 Hybrid Classification (GWOMFO)\nSolutions in the literature for network\
    \ attack detection systems face many problems such as low\ndetection accuracy,\
    \ unbalanced detection rates, and difficulty of attack detection in real-time\
    \ networks.\nAs a result, hybrid algorithms were developed to achieve the best\
    \ possible accuracy by combining\nseveral algorithms to solve these problems.\
    \ In hybrid techniques, in general, each component has tasks\nin different phases,\
    \ such as preprocessing, classification, clustering, and they can also be used\
    \ together\nin the same phase. In this study, the hybrid structure obtained by\
    \ combining the GWO and MFO\nalgorithms was applied and tested in the classification\
    \ phase. Our aim is to develop a new metaheuristic\napproach for training artificial\
    \ neural network (ANN) and to show that the method we have developed\nis also\
    \ successful in the network attack detection system using the models trained with\
    \ the algorithms\nwe have compared. The values in the population of the hybrid\
    \ algorithm form the weights and biases\nused in training the ANN. The data we\
    \ observed and obtained show that the network was well trained\nand successfully\
    \ detects attacks compared to studies trained with other algorithms.\nIn this\
    \ section, the developed hybrid algorithm is presented. We propose a method to\
    \ develop a\nhybrid IDS that combines two machine learning algorithms. In this\
    \ hybrid model, GWO and MFO are\ncombined to create a hybrid model. Metaheuristic\
    \ algorithms are algorithms that aim to find global\nor near-optimal solutions.\
    \ The ability of the GWO algorithm to find a global optimum and the success\n\
    of the MFO algorithm in achieving the best result suggest that better performance\
    \ can be achieved by\ncombining these two algorithms.\nIn GWO, wolves update their\
    \ positions according to the food source. During this update, the\nalpha wolves\
    \ and the other wolves try to be closest to the food source. Poorly obtained positions\
    \ are\nnot considered in the GWO calculations. In the MFO algorithm, the best\
    \ solutions are included in\nthe calculations to obtain the new solution. It is\
    \ assumed that in this way the best solution is found\nto reach the food source.\
    \ The GWOMFO algorithm was developed based on the GWO algorithm,\nwhose pseudocode\
    \ is given in Table 4. The equations developed for the GWOMFO algorithm, and\n\
    the explanations of these equations are as follows.\nTable 4: GWOMFO pseudo-code\n\

    The data set obtained after the data preprocessing described in the previous Section\
    \ 4.1.1 was used\nto train and test the proposed system. In this algorithm, the\
    \ effect of the agents of the GWO algorithm\nis improved based on the MFO algorithm.\
    \ This method aims to improve the global convergence,\ndiscovery, and exploitation\
    \ performance instead of running the variant for countless generations\nwithout\
    \ improvement.\nThe flowchart of the developed hybrid algorithm is shown below\
    \ in Fig. 1.\nIn the mathematical model for gray wolf hunting strategy, delta,\
    \ beta, and alpha wolves are\nassumed to provide better information about prey\
    \ location. Therefore, the first three best solutions\nare used to update the\
    \ positions of wolves in the GWO algorithm. Moreover, the best solution from\n\
    the MFO algorithm was evaluated with the found solutions, and a new best solution\
    \ was created.\nThe equation given by Eq. (16) is used to improve the position\
    \ in the GWOMFO algorithm. In this\nequation, the position obtained with the GWO\
    \ agents is evaluated together with the position from the\nMFO algorithm. The\
    \ 4 best solutions at time t are represented by Xa, Xb, Xd and Xm.\nXt+1 = (Xa\
    \ + Xb + Xd + Xm)/4\n(16)\nIn this algorithm, hybridization was achieved by interfering\
    \ with the standard GWO algorithm in\n2 stages. First, a condition was added in\
    \ the exploitation stage to improve hunting performance. Then,\nEq. (16) was applied.\
    \ A new mechanism was added to improve the solution. This improved the hunting\n\
    mechanism of the GWO. After each iteration, the solution is evolved. Also, the\
    \ added condition\nimproves the search ability and the exploration phase and increases\
    \ the quality of the solution.\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1289\nFigure 1: Flowchart\
    \ of the proposed algorithm (GWOMFO)\nGWOMFO is started by initializing the population\
    \ size of both the MFO and GWO search agents.\nAfter this process, the fitness\
    \ value is calculated. After the value assignments for the agents are made,\n\
    the position updates of the existing search agents are performed using the appropriate\
    \ equations\naccording to the value of parameter p up to the maximum number of\
    \ iterations (L) in the loop. After\nthese operations, the fitness value is calculated,\
    \ and the process continues until a suitable solution is\nfound.\nThe parameter\
    \ p is a randomly generated number. If the random value is less than or equal\
    \ to\n0.5, position updates are performed using alpha, beta, and delta position\
    \ equations. The calculation\nis performed using Eq. (6) in this condition. The\
    \ positions are updated if the new position is better\nthan the old one. If it\
    \ is greater than 0.5, Eq. (16) is used and updated again, comparing it with the\
    \ old\npositions. As a result, the fitness value is calculated again. The best\
    \ fitness value is returned.\nIn metaheuristic approaches, there are two main\
    \ components directly related to the search ability\nof an algorithm: exploration\
    \ and exploitation. Exploration seeks to find promising solutions by\ngoing deep\
    \ into unknown territory. In other words, exploration aims to increase the diversity\
    \ of\nsolutions. In contrast, exploitation aims to improve the quality of solutions\
    \ by searching locally around\n1290\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\ndiscoverable and\
    \ promising solutions. These components conflict with each other and influence\
    \ each\nother. Therefore, an optimization algorithm should be designed with a\
    \ correct and appropriate balance\nbetween exploration and exploitation. With\
    \ this hybrid algorithm, an improvement in exploration and\nexploitation performance\
    \ was observed. This is also reflected in the results obtained. The pseudocode\n\
    of the GWOMFO algorithm is shown in Table 4.\n4.1.3 Training\nBefore modeling\
    \ or estimation, data sets are separated into training and test data sets. In\
    \ this\nseparation, the hold-out method was used, and 2/3 of the original data\
    \ was reserved as the training\ndata set and 1/3 as the test data set [41]. Training\
    \ of the algorithm was performed using the training\nsets obtained in this way.\n\
    4.1.4 Testing\nDuring the testing phase, eight swarm intelligence-based algorithms\
    \ (GWO, MFO, DE, PSO,\nMVO, JAYA, SSA, and SCA) and the algorithm developed in\
    \ this study were applied separately and\ntested on the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and\
    \ CIC IDS 2017 data sets. The results obtained by each\nalgorithm were studied\
    \ separately.\n4.1.5 Evaluation\nSeveral quantitative metrics are used to interpret\
    \ the results obtained by the testing process\nperformed in the study. These metrics\
    \ are:\nAccuracy: Shows the percentage of correct estimates. It is calculated\
    \ based on the Confusion\nMatrix.\nAccuracy = TPs + TNs/n\nTrue Positive Rate\
    \ (TPR): Total number of true positives.\nTPR = TPs/(FNs + TPs)\nFalse Positive\
    \ Rate (FPR): The formula used to calculate this ratio is below.\nFPR = FPs/TNs\
    \ + FPs\nSensitivity (Recall): Shows how well positive situations are predicted.\n\
    Sensitivity = TPs/(TPs + FNs)\nPrecision: It is the criterion that shows the success\
    \ in positive predictions.\nPrecision = TPs/(TPs + FPs)\nF-measure: Harmonic average\
    \ of the values for sensitivity and precision.\nStudies were assessed and compared\
    \ using these metrics.\n4.2 Data Set Descriptions\nIn this study, 3 different\
    \ data sets were examined. The data sets used in this study are known in\nthe\
    \ literature as commonly used data sets for network attack detection. These data\
    \ sets, which differ\nin terms of attack types and number and type of features,\
    \ were evaluated in the study to obtain more\naccurate results about the generalizability\
    \ and robustness of the developed algorithm. By using these\nthree different data\
    \ sets, the performance changes and consistency of the algorithm developed in\
    \ this\nstudy will be examined. These data sets are listed below, respectively.\n\
    CMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1291\n4.2.1 NSL-KDD\nNSL-KDD is a commonly used data\
    \ set for network attack detection and can also be represented\nas a model. This\
    \ data set has been used in many studies in the literature [42–46]. It is an extended\n\
    version of the data set known as KDD Cup’99. Several problems with the KDD Cup’99\
    \ data set\nhave been fixed with the NSL-KDD data set [47]. In particular, biased\
    \ results should be avoided by\nremoving unnecessary records [48]. The NSL-KDD\
    \ data set is the result of an evolution of the KDD\nCup’99 data set, but has\
    \ the same characteristics as the KDD Cup’99 data set in terms of features. It\n\
    contains no unnecessary data, but enough data to train and test. These data sets,\
    \ defined as attacks,\nare classified into four main classes. These are DOS, Probe,\
    \ User to Root (U2R), and Remote to Local\n(R2L) attacks. The distribution of\
    \ the data set used is shown in Table 5.\nTable 5: Data distribution of dataset\

    \ factors in evaluating the performance of IDS and developing more\neffective\
    \ and efficient IDSs is the data sets used [49]. The most commonly used data sets\
    \ to measure\nthe performance of IDS are KDD99 and NSL-KDD. Data sets are essential\
    \ for developing IDS and\nmeasuring its performance. The data set used should\
    \ meet the time requirements and include current\nattack types. The literature’s\
    \ most commonly used KDD99 and NSLKDD data sets are different\nfrom current conditions\
    \ in terms of attack types and normal traffic scenarios, and the distribution\n\
    of training and testing data sets is also different. It is now assumed that current\
    \ data sets should be\nused in studies. To address these issues, data sets such\
    \ as UNSW-NB15, CIC IDS 2017 have been\ndeveloped to capture current and modern\
    \ attack types [50].\n4.2.2 UNSW-NB15\nThis data set was created using the IXIA\
    \ PerfectStorm tool at the Australian Cyber Security\nCenter (ACCS) Cyber Range\
    \ Lab to merge modern, realistic normal network activity and attack\nbehavior\
    \ from network traffic [50]. This data set has been used in many studies in the\
    \ literature [51–\n55]. Unlike NSLKDD, this data set contains original versions\
    \ of the various identity states that are\ncommon today. Attacks in this data\
    \ set include fuzzer, analytics, backdoor, DoS, exploit, general,\nreconnaissance,\

    5 Experimental Results\nIn this section, information about the simulation and\
    \ its environment is given, and the results\nobtained with the hybrid algorithm\
    \ are explained and discussed.\n5.1 Simulation Setup\nTo briefly discuss the working\
    \ environment and the programs used in this study, the computer\nconfigurations\
    \ used for the proposed method are as follows. Two computers are used for development\n\
    and deployment. The development computer is a home PC with an Intel Core i7-4500U\
    \ CPU, 16 GB\nRAM, and a 1 TB SATA HDD. The deployment computer has Intel Xeon\
    \ E5-2620 v4 2.10 GHz\nprocessors (8 cores) server, 64 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and\
    \ 1 TB SATA HDD. In addition, Python\nversion 3.7.6 was used as the programming\
    \ language and programmed with Spyder IDE.\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1295\n\
    In all experiments, the values of common parameters such as total number of iterations\
    \ and\npopulation size used in each algorithm are chosen to be the same. Equal\
    \ search agent, equal run, and\nequal iteration are set in all run algorithms.\
    \ The search agent used in all algorithms is set to 30, the\nnumber of runs is\
    \ set to 30, and the number of iterations is set to 100. The developed algorithm\
    \ was first\ntested in benchmark functions and its results were examined. Then,\
    \ it was tested on 3 different data sets\nthat are commonly used in the literature.\
    \ It is aimed to ensure the consistency and generalizability of\nthe algorithm\
    \ by running the developed algorithm under the same conditions on 3 different\
    \ data sets.\nIn the study, Evolopy framework which developed for ANN training,\
    \ optimization problem\nsolving, clustering operations and feature selection was\
    \ used. Each algorithm studied may use its own\nparameters, may use various constant\
    \ values, and these may vary according to the applied problems.\nThe values in\
    \ the Evolopy framework are used in the parameter values of the algorithms [62].\
    \ In this\nstudy, the method in which the number of hidden neurons is (2 × N +\
    \ 1) was chosen; N is the number\nof features in each dataset. For each dataset,\
    \ all input features values are normalized in the range [0, 1]\nwith normalization\
    \ technique Eq. (15).\n5.2 Benchmark Functions and Results\nBenchmark functions\
    \ to test and validate newly created optimization algorithms with different\n\
    properties. One of the most important properties of these functions is that they\
    \ are differentiable,\ndecomposable, scalable, continuous, unimodal, bimodal,\
    \ continuous, and discontinuous. These prop-\nerties can determine which problems\
    \ an algorithm will succeed on.\nThe hybrid algorithm developed in this study\
    \ was tested using benchmark functions with different\ncharacteristics and compared\
    \ with various optimization algorithms from the literature. These func-\ntions,\
    \ studied in 2 groups as single-mode and multi-mode, are characterized as single-mode\
    \ functions\ncontaining only one global optimum, and functions with more than\
    \ one local and global optimum are\ncalled multi-mode benchmark functions. Functions\
    \ F1–F7 are called unimodal functions, which have\na single solution. This makes\
    \ the convergence rate very suitable for testing and applying algorithms. As\n\
    a result, the GWOMFO exploitation capability can be evaluated by using these unimodal\
    \ functions.\nIn other functions, such as F8–F13, which are multimodal functions\
    \ and they are useful to assess our\nproposed algorithm in terms of exploration.\
    \ For multimode benchmark functions, there is more than\none optimal value, and\
    \ one of them is the global optimum while the other values are defined as local\n\
    optima. This is a more complex problem than for single-mode benchmark functions.\
    \ If the discovery\nprocess of an evolved algorithm is poorly designed, no effective\
    \ wide-angle search can be performed,\nresulting in the algorithm getting stuck\
    \ in the local optimum. For this reason, these functions seem to\nbe the most\
    \ difficult problem for many algorithms.\nIn this study, 13 functions were investigated\
    \ as single-mode and multi-mode. These functions\nprovide an important starting\
    \ point to test the reliability of a developed algorithm. There are many\nlocal\
    \ optimal points in the solution spaces for these functions. As the complexity\
    \ increases, the number\nof local optima also increases. In the following, we\
    \ describe in detail each of the benchmark functions\nused in this study.\nThese\
    \ studied functions are listed in Table 11.\n1296\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n\

    \ within the range [−50.0; 50.0]. The exact global minimum for all these\nproblems\
    \ is obtained with an objective function value of zero. The developed algorithm\
    \ was applied\nto these 13 benchmark functions.\nEach function was run 30 times\
    \ for the benchmark functions, and the standard deviation and\nmean were calculated\
    \ based on the obtained results. The developed hybrid algorithm was applied to\n\
    benchmark functions, and the results were compared with algorithms based on swarm\
    \ intelligence such\nas DE, PSO, MVO, JAYA, SSA, SCA. Table 12 contains the comparison\
    \ results. This table contains\nthe mean and standard deviation of the algorithms\
    \ used in the benchmark functions. When examining\nthe means and standard deviations,\
    \ it was found that GWOMFO generally achieved better means and\nstandard deviations\
    \ for all benchmark functions.\nIn addition to these results, the average convergence\
    \ curves of the benchmark functions optimized\nby GWOMFO are shown in Fig. 2.\n\
    The graphs in Fig. 2 represent the convergence curves generated for benchmark\
    \ functions. In these\ngraphs, the horizontal axis represents the index of repetitions,\
    \ and the vertical axis is the divergence\nbetween two consecutive objective function\
    \ values. The convergence curve shows the value of the\nobjective function compared\
    \ to the computation time during minimization (model calibration). This\ntesting\
    \ procedure aims to solve the optimization problems in earlier iterations, reduce\
    \ the convergence\ntime and obtain a better solution. Thirteen benchmark functions\
    \ known in the literature were used for\nthe experimental studies. The ultimate\
    \ goal of optimization is either to reduce the convergence time to\nobtain the\
    \ best solution or to increase the efficiency of the algorithm. In this context,\
    \ the main goal\nof the developed GWOMFO algorithm focuses on reducing the convergence\
    \ time, obtaining effective\nresults and improving the local search capability.\
    \ In this way, the algorithm is designed to reach the\nsolution in fewer iterations.\
    \ By looking at the change on the y-axis, you can see how fast it converges\n\
    to the optimal result. In this case, we can say that the most suitable individuals\
    \ are selected in early\niterations to reduce the computational cost of the algorithm.\n\

    \ Results.\n6 Conclusions and Future Work\nIn this study, the topic of network\
    \ attacks and detection is discussed, the data sets commonly\nused to solve this\
    \ problem are examined, and the studies in the literature and the results obtained\n\
    are mentioned. The importance of hybrid solutions to improve the performance of\
    \ the proposed\nalgorithms for the solution has been highlighted. It has been\
    \ shown that the use of benchmark\nfunctions in the preliminary evaluation of\
    \ the performance of a developed algorithm provides insight\ninto the performance\
    \ of the algorithm. This study developed and tested a new hybrid algorithm with\n\
    1308\nCMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\nNSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC IDS 2017 data sets.\
    \ There is always a need to improve existing\nmethods’ solution quality and develop\
    \ new methods. Hybrid algorithms can be used to improve the\nsolution quality\
    \ or performance of the algorithm. In the algorithm developed in this study, the\
    \ effect\nof the search agents of the GWO algorithm was improved by hybridizing\
    \ it with the MFO algorithm.\nTo this algorithm, which was developed based on\
    \ the GWO algorithm, a new mechanism was added\nto improve the hunting mechanism\
    \ of the GWO algorithm. It was observed that the search ability\nand exploration\
    \ phase were improved after each iteration, which improved the solution. The obtained\n\
    results show that the location updates are more successful and efficient depending\
    \ on the search\nagents. Unlike studies in the literature, the hybrid algorithm\
    \ developed in this study was first tested\nin benchmark functions and then tested\
    \ on data sets used for network attacks. Performance analyzes\nwere performed\
    \ by adapting the developed algorithm to 13 benchmark functions. The results obtained\n\
    were compared with many different studies in this study and the following conclusions\
    \ were drawn:\ni. GWOMFO achieved the best average results on 12 of the 13 benchmark\
    \ functions compared\nto other algorithms.\nii. The best classification accuracy\
    \ was achieved in the NSL-KDD data set with 97.4%.\niii. The best classification\
    \ accuracy was achieved in the UNSW-NB15 data set with 98.3%.\niv. The best classification\
    \ accuracy was achieved in the CIC IDS 2017 data set with 99.2%.\nv. In general,\
    \ GWOMFO performed well and achieved high detection rates for all attack types.\n\
    The results were compared with the results of different optimization algorithms\
    \ from the literature.\nIt was found that the developed hybrid model showed a\
    \ successful result. The success of GWOMFO\nis due to the newly developed equation,\
    \ the structure of the algorithm and the parameters used.\nThe obtained results\
    \ proved that the GWOMFO algorithm is successful in the benchmark functions\n\
    compared to the algorithms with which it is compared. The successful results obtained\
    \ on the tested\ndatasets also support the algorithm’s success. By bringing this\
    \ developed algorithm to the literature,\none of the expected goals is to extend\
    \ techniques that can be adapted to real-world, hard-to-solve\nproblems.\nNetwork\
    \ security will continue to be a topic that will always be alive. This is because\
    \ network\ndefense is a necessity. With many recent studies such as [25–28] listed\
    \ in the related works section\nof this study, network security is being discussed\
    \ from many different angles and will continue to be\naddressed from many different\
    \ angles and with many new methods. In addition to this study, we are\ncurrently\
    \ working on simultaneous network attack detection, and other possible future\
    \ work could\ninclude the following:\n1. Studies may be conducted to further increase\
    \ the success rates achieved in this study. For this\npurpose, hybridization with\
    \ various improved algorithms from the literature can be performed.\nAlso, various\
    \ improved feature extraction algorithms can achieve better performance.\n2. This\
    \ hybrid approach can be applied to different data sets, and the results can be\
    \ observed. It\ncan also solve various optimization problems, such as feature\
    \ selection. To improve network\nsecurity infrastructure, Deep Learning can be\
    \ used to develop next-generation intrusion\ndetection systems that detect network\
    \ threats instantly and with higher accuracy. Developing\nan IDS model for multi-class\
    \ data problems using multiple networks in Deep Learning is also\npossible.\n\
    CMES, 2023, vol.136, no.2\n1309\nHowever, a possible limitation of the proposed\
    \ method is that we tested GWOMFO on only three\ndatasets. It will also be important\
    \ to test the method on a more recent dataset. We believe that the\nproposed method\
    \ can be extended to many domains in the future.\nFunding Statement: This work\

    \ Pontifícia Universidade \nCatólica do Rio de Janeiro. \n \nThis dissertation\
    \ examines the role of cyber security companies in the \nproduction of contemporary\
    \ cyber security. The increasing pressures to securitize \ncyberspace have contributed\
    \ to the growth of a lucrative market oriented at \nproviding cyber security products\
    \ and services to commercial and government \ncustomers. Using a Bourdieu-inspired\
    \ framework, the work: analyzes the historical \nconditions under which information\
    \ technologies gained ground within security \ndebates; identifies the positions\
    \ and investigates the practices of cyber security \ncompanies within the cyber\
    \ security field and analyzes the ongoing struggles for \nthe production of cyber\
    \ security. Risk-based thinking is a cornerstone of the process \nof conceiving\
    \ and commercializing products and services advertised by companies. \nIn this\
    \ sense, it is argued that both risk-based thinking and the commercial practices\
    \ \nof cyber security companies produce specific forms of security. The work identifies\
    \ \nthree distinct forms of security produced within the field: defensive security,\
    \ \noffensive security and active defense. It analyzes the implications of each\
    \ form to \nthe overall security of cyberspace and argues that whilst the majority\
    \ of companies \nadopt an active defense approach in their products and services,\
    \ some of them are \nleaning towards more offensive solutions to deal with current\
    \ risks. It concludes the \nanalysis with some thoughts on the implications of\
    \ the current dynamics of the \ncyber security market for security and Internet\
    \ governance. \n \n \nKeywords  \nCyber Security; Private Companies; Pierre Bourdieu;\

    \ Janeiro, \n2016. 171p. Dissertação de Mestrado – Instituto de Relações Internacionais,\
    \ \nPontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro. \n \nA presente dissertação\
    \ investiga o papel das companhias de segurança \ncibernética na produção da segurança\
    \ cibernética contemporânea. A crescente \npressão para securitizar o ciberespaço\
    \ contribuiu para o crescimento de um \nlucrativo mercado voltado para a provisão\
    \ de produtos e serviços para clientes \ncomerciais e governamentais. Utilizando\
    \ uma perspectiva inspirada em Bourdieu, \no trabalho: analisa as condições históricas\
    \ nas quais as tecnologias da informação \nganharam terreno no debate de segurança;\
    \ identifica as posições e investiga as \npráticas das companhias de segurança\
    \ cibernética no campo da segurança \ncibernética e analisa as disputas em andamento\
    \ pela produção da segurança \ncibernética. Abordagens voltadas ao risco são pilares\
    \ na concepção e \ncomercialização de produtos e serviços anunciados pelas companhias.\
    \ Neste \nsentido, argumenta-se que ambas as abordagens voltadas ao risco e as\
    \ práticas \ncomerciais das companhias de segurança cibernética produzem formas\
    \ específicas \nde segurança. O trabalho identifica três distintas formas de segurança\
    \ produzidas \nno campo: segurança defensiva, segurança ofensiva e defesa ativa.\
    \ Analisa-se as \nimplicações de cada forma para a segurança, de um modo geral,\
    \ e argumenta-se \nque, enquanto grande parte das companhias adota uma estratégia\
    \ de defesa ativa em \nseus produtos e serviços, algumas tem se orientado para\
    \ a adoção de medidas mais \nofensivas para lidar com os atuais riscos. A análise\
    \ é concluída com algumas \nreflexões a respeito das implicações das atuais dinâmicas\
    \ do mercado de segurança \ncibernética para a segurança e governança da Internet.\

    PUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n \n1. Introduction \nThe commonsense\
    \ leads people to see information and communication tech-\nnologies (ICTs) as\
    \ a constitutive aspect of contemporary developed and developing \nsocieties,\
    \ despite the existence of a digital gap between those with access to the \nInternet\
    \ and a majority that is still deprived of it. In societies where these \ntechnologies\
    \ have been successfully diffused, their pervasiveness in the execution \nof everyday\
    \ tasks is so evident, and they have become so naturalized, that people \ntend\
    \ to forget how much they depend on their correct and uninterrupted operation\
    \ \nto do the most basic operations, such as shopping for supplies in the local\
    \ \nsupermarket or sending an e-mail to set or cancel a meeting, for example.\
    \ It has \nbecome so natural that users have either forgotten or never been aware\
    \ of what \nremains underneath the “surface1.” \nAnnually, governments and private\
    \ companies host hacking competitions \nacross the world. The world’s largest\
    \ competition, DEF CON, happens in Las \nVegas, in the United States (U.S.), since\
    \ 1993. The event is attended by journalists, \ncomputer security professionals,\
    \ lawyers, U.S. federal government employees, \nsecurity researchers, students\
    \ and hackers, and consists of speeches, social events \nand contests. These events\
    \ are pools for companies and government agencies \nseeking specialized workforce\
    \ and they are important in that they uncover security \nbreaches and allow for\
    \ the development of new software. In a hacking contest \nhosted by Google, in\
    \ 2012, the former vulnerability company VUPEN gained \nworldwide fame when it\
    \ refused to share with Google a newly discovered flaw in \nthe Chrome Web browser.\
    \ The company’s CEO justified the reason it did so: “We \nwouldn’t share this\
    \ with Google for even $1 million,” he said. “We don’t want to \ngive them any\
    \ knowledge that can help them in fixing this exploit or other similar \nexploits.\
    \ We want to keep this for our customers.” (BEKRAR apud GREENBERG, \n2012) (One\
    \ of these customers was the U.S. government itself.) VUPEN has ceased \nits businesses\
    \ and its CEO has founded a new company in the U.S. named \nZERODIUM. The business\
    \ of vulnerability exploit, however, still seems to be up.\n                 \
    \                                          \n1 In the Internet language, the term\
    \ “surface” refers to the layer of the Internet that is readily available \nto\
    \ users and searchable through search websites, such as Google (also said to be\
    \ “indexed”). There \nis a layer that is not directly accessible to users with\
    \ the basics of the Internet, called the Deep Web.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n15 \n VUPEN’s behavior has partially uncovered some of the Internet\
    \ dynamics \nthat remain concealed from the everyday user. But as troublesome\
    \ as it seems, it is \nstill the tip of the iceberg. These dynamics involve intense\
    \ disputes and adaptive \nalliances between private corporations and governments,\
    \ conflicting interests be-\ntween hackers and their governments and the active\
    \ engagement of national security \nexperts in trying to frame a given scenario\
    \ as a threat.  \nMost users have little clue of the extent of the – sometimes\
    \ very secretive – \nongoing power struggles to control information fluxes. These\
    \ struggles involve a \nmultiplicity of public and private stakeholders and may\
    \ affect, either directly or \nmore subtly, the way people experience the Internet.\
    \ They address issues of privacy \nand surveillance, security and freedom, and\
    \ to a certain extent, all converge to a \ntopic that has become quite a commonplace\
    \ in the universe of policy-making. The \nname is cyber security. \nThe present\
    \ research investigates the practices of private companies and their \nimplications\
    \ for cyber security. The research strategy adopts a Bourdieu-inspired \napproach\
    \ to practices, considering the ‘space’ where these companies struggle for \n\
    influence as fields and the services, advertisements and the discourses they offer\
    \ as \nconstituents of these practices. The main objective is to understand the\
    \ role that a \nparticular kind of private companies, labeled cyber security companies,\
    \ plays in \n‘securing’ cyberspace and the implications of their practices for\
    \ ‘security.’ \nFundamental to this purpose is to investigate how pressures to\
    \ ‘secure’ cyberspace \nhave contributed to the legitimation of these actors’\
    \ practices and over which bases \nthis process happens. Specifically, the work\
    \ will analyze (1) the relationship that \nhas been built between these agents\
    \ and government actors, which the work will \naddress as the phenomenon of the\
    \ ‘marketization of cyber security;’ (2) the \nstruggles between companies and\
    \ between these and other actors for the rising \ncyber security market, as well\
    \ as the practices employed; and (3) the role of ‘risk’ \nin the process of securing\
    \ cyberspace. \nThis is relevant for understanding the dynamics of cyber security\
    \ and its \nlucrative market as well as the consequences of private security not\
    \ only in terms \nof the political arrangements it gives birth to, but also to\
    \ individual privacy and \npolitical accountability. \nThe dissertation works\
    \ with two main hypotheses. The first hypothesis con-\nsiders that recurrent pressures\
    \ to secure cyberspace have led to the development of \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n16 \na dynamical cyber security market. One side of this\
    \ market aims at securing \ncyberspace against cyber threats through the commercialization\
    \ of cyber security \nsolutions, from antiviruses to more specific and directed\
    \ services oriented at \nidentifying security breaches in computer systems. The\
    \ other side of this market is \noriented towards commercializing and exploiting\
    \ ‘insecurities’ in computing \ndevices, networks and critical infrastructures.\
    \ This exploitation can happen when \ncompanies sell and operate invasive surveillance\
    \ technologies for governments, or \nwhen they commercialize with governments\
    \ distinct and sometimes obscure \nservices, such as malwares, viruses, access\
    \ to Internet Protocols (IPs) of public \nauthorities’ computers in foreign countries\
    \ and so forth. \nThe second hypothesis is that risk-based thinking has become\
    \ constitutive of \nthe habitus of the agents in the field of cyber security.\
    \ On the one hand, it is useful \nfor making sense of a myriad of cyber threats\
    \ and for justifying certain perceptions \nof security carried out by governments,\
    \ security experts and the private sector. On \nthe other hand, it orients the\
    \ very actions of private companies in what concerns the \ndevelopment of security\
    \ products and services. This mode of thinking is grounded \non fundamental assumptions\
    \ of the information society thesis, which addresses the \nimplications of the\
    \ development of information and communication technologies \n(ICTs) to societies.\
    \ By orienting perceptions and actions towards cyber-threats, a \nrisk-based thinking\
    \ has implications for the solutions that are conceived to address \nthem. In\
    \ this sense, this ‘background knowledge’ of the cyber security field may \nlead\
    \ to very specific forms of framing and responses to perceived cyber threats.\
    \ A \nrisk-based approach to cyber security may legitimize the adoption of preemptive\
    \ \nmeasures to anticipate highly uncertain scenarios. It may as well mask certain\
    \ forms \nof exploitation of cyberspace as ‘solutions’ to mitigate security risks.\
    \ \nCyber security  \nFor Hansen and Nissenbaum (2009), the term “cyber security”\
    \ was first used \nin the early 1990s to stress the insecurities related to networked\
    \ computers. It differs \na little from the exclusively technical emphasis of\
    \ computer/information security \nbecause of the potential devastating effects\
    \ that digital technologies could have in \nsociety. In the Computer Science and\
    \ Telecommunications Board (CSTB) report \n“Computers at risk: safe computing\
    \ in the information age” these devastating \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº\
    \ 1412452/CA\n17 \neffects are seen as ‘risks,’ increased by the dependence on\
    \ computers. The CSTB \nreport (1991) argues that as much as these machines are\
    \ trusted, they are vulnerable. \nThe threats that could explore these vulnerabilities\
    \ range from criminal and terrorist \nactivities to systemic failures of hardware\
    \ and software. The latter threats represent \nan “inherent ontological insecurity\
    \ within computer systems” (HANSEN; \nNISSENBAUM, 2009:1160) stemming from their\
    \ unpredictable and uncertain \nbehavior. \nThe topic became popular in the last\
    \ decade, triggered by a series of \nworldwide events and by experts’ discourses.\
    \ The cyber-attacks2 against Estonia \nand Georgia, between 2007 and 2008, and\
    \ the uncover of the Stuxnet exploit3 to an \nIranian nuclear power plant in 2010\
    \ figure as the most relevant ‘cyber’ incidents \nthat gained broad international\
    \ relevance. In the meanwhile, the body of policy-\npapers and books dealing with\
    \ the topic only grew from the 1990s to the present. \nThese incidents are but\
    \ a small parcel of the cyber-attacks launched on a daily \nbasis against individuals,\
    \ private companies, governments and non-governmental \norganizations. According\
    \ to a report of the US Bipartisan Policy Center’s \nHomeland Security Project\
    \ (2012), between October 2011 and February 2012, over \n50.000 cyber-attacks\
    \ on private and governmental networks were reported to US \nDepartment of Homeland\
    \ Security (DHS). The document considers that these \nincidents are representative\
    \ of a small fraction of daily attacks directed against the \ncountry’s informational\
    \ infrastructure. Worldwide, the number multiplies to \nmillions or even billions\
    \ daily. The Symantec’s 2014 Internet Security Threat \nReport shows that around\
    \ 568,700 web attacks were blocked per day in the last \nyear. The year faced\
    \ 253 data breach incidents, a number 16% higher than in 2012. \nThese breaches\
    \ resulted in the exposure of at least 10 million identities in an only \nincident.\
    \ In the totality, around 552 million identities were exposed that year, a \n\
    number 493% higher than in 2012. \n                                          \
    \                 \n2 A cyber-attack is an offensive that targets the theft, destruction\
    \ or alteration of computing devices, \ninfrastructures and networks. There are\
    \ several categories of cyber-attacks. Among them, are the \nDistributed-Denial-Of-Service\
    \ (DDoS) attacks, which overwhelm servers’ capacities with illegiti-\nmate information\
    \ requests originating from multiple sources, the so-called “zombie” computers\
    \ \nremotely run by a central data processor. This category of attack was deployed\
    \ against Georgia and \nEstonia. \n3 The stuxnet is a worm, a malware computer\
    \ program that replicated itself to infect other computers. \nIt was developed\
    \ to attack Siemens’ control systems and it damaged the centrifuges used in Iran’s\
    \ \nnuclear program. The worm is considered the most successful cyberattack to\
    \ date in terms of \nmaterial effects. See Dunn Cavelty (2011). \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n18 \nSimilar to the early CSTB report’s characterization,\
    \ the DHS regards cyber \nsecurity as the securing of the cyberspace and its underlying\
    \ infrastructure against \na wide range of ‘risks’ (DHS, 2015). In the same vein,\
    \ the International \nTelecommunications Union (ITU) understands it as the attempt\
    \ to ensure the \nattainment and maintenance of security properties of cyber environment’s\
    \ \norganization and user assets, which involves the totality of transmitted and\
    \ stored \ninformation online, against relevant security risks (ITU, 2008). The\
    \ ITU considers \ncyber security in relation to distinct threats against data\
    \ communication. These are \nthe theft, destruction, removal or loss of information\
    \ or other resources, the \ncorruption or modification of information, the disclosure\
    \ of information and the \ninterruption of services. Activities like espionage\
    \ and cyber-crime are currently \nseen as the main and most pressing ‘threats’\
    \ in cyberspace (CSIS, 2011). \nCyber security, thus, comprises the attempts to\
    \ protect digital information, \nflowing through vulnerable networks or stored\
    \ in vulnerable databases, from \ninternal disruption or from disruption by ‘malicious’\
    \ third parties. The diffusion of \nthe use of computer technologies in society,\
    \ whereas it was originally a defense \nproject employed by some research networks,\
    \ has fed some concerns with the \nsecurity of the informational fluxes and the\
    \ material that assures their uninterrupted \nfunctioning. Cyber security is,\
    \ today, understood as a primary national security \nconcern in the US (CSIS,\
    \ 2008; 2010; 2011).  \nAs it is possible to observe in the definitions presented\
    \ above, the \nentanglement between cyber security and national security tends\
    \ to be made in \nterms of the risks that vulnerabilities in security systems\
    \ and networks may pose to \nthe latter and to international security as well\
    \ (see, for example, CLARK; KNAKE, \n2010; BRITO; WATKINS, 2011). The CSTB report\
    \ (1991) argues that computer \nrisks and the societal effects they may generate\
    \ dialogue with the field of security, \nwhich has been traditionally discussed\
    \ in terms of vulnerabilities, threats and \ncountermeasures. As a reaction to\
    \ a scenario of uncertainty, risk seems to play an \nimportant role in orienting\
    \ the imaginary and practices concerning technology, in \ngeneral, and cyber security,\
    \ in particular. It is also an essential component of the \nthreat-framing process,\
    \ as it refers to what agents interpret as unsecure and how \nthey will answer\
    \ to it (DUNN CAVELTY, 2008). Experts say that the risks faced \nby computers\
    \ are due to their vulnerability (to third parties’ exploitation or to \nsystemic\
    \ failures, for example). Accordingly, advances in IT and the increased \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n19 \ndependence on these systems would\
    \ result in a decreasing capacity to control risk \nand secure information (DUNN\
    \ CAVELTY, 2008). \nThere has been a certain inflation of the cyber threat in\
    \ political circles and \nby the industry, particularly regarding the risks it\
    \ poses to national security, critical \ninfrastructure, and concerns with an\
    \ eventual ‘cyber war’ (CARAFANO, 2015; \nARQUILA; RONFELDT, 1993), with the possibility\
    \ of ‘cyber-terrorism’ and with \nthe use of military language to address cyber-threats\
    \ (DUNN CAVELTY, 2012). \nThis overemphasis on the cyber threat has been pointed\
    \ as responsible for \nfueling the multibillionaire market of cyber security (BRITO;\
    \ WATKINS; 2011; \nDEIBERT; 2011). As the numbers presented above may indicate,\
    \ pressures to se-\ncure cyberspace turn out to be a great business opportunity\
    \ for private companies, \nwhich struggle for a parcel of the cyber security market.\
    \ Yet, considering how cyber \nsecurity seems to be linked to private enterprise,\
    \ one has to question what this cyber \nsecurity market is about and what would\
    \ be the consequences of what Anderson \n(2001) calls ‘perverse incentives’? \n\
    Private actors \nAs a core aspect of the Internet governance (DENARDIS, 2014),\
    \ existing \nattempts to ensure security in cyberspace bump into the specificities\
    \ of the historical \nand technical development of ICTs. The particular, almost\
    \ innate, distributed \narchitecture of the Internet is one of its strongest characteristics,\
    \ but also a source \nof concerns in security policy making circles, because of\
    \ the potential \nvulnerabilities it may create. The ownership and operation of\
    \ cyberspace is another \ncase-in-point, and one to which governments have played\
    \ a special attention. Profit \nand non-profit private actors share the responsibility\
    \ for the ownership and \noperation of virtual infrastructures and the physical\
    \ infrastructure that allows its \nfunctioning. Hence, national security concerns\
    \ are dependent on the private sector, \nwhich has been a main driver in the evolution\
    \ of ICTs. \nA lot of attention has been given to the role of the state in shaping\
    \ cyber \nsecurity (GOLDSMITH; WU, 2006; ERIKSSON; GIACOMELLO, 2009; BETZ; \n\
    STEVENS, 2011), but the same does not occur when other agents involved in \ndisputes\
    \ over the definitional and practical aspects of cyber security are concerned.\
    \ \nThis is worrisome when one considers the importance of the private sector,\
    \ and in \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n20 \nparticular of private\
    \ companies, which can be primarily distinguished from other \nprivate agents\
    \ because of their profit-seeking activities, for the maintenance and \noperation\
    \ of cyberspace. There are groups of private companies that hold a special \n\
    relation to (and concern with) cyber security: banks, risk-management corporations,\
    \ \nIT firms, and so on. A whole market of software and services is oriented towards\
    \ \nthe protection of corporate and private information against security breaches.\
    \ Cyber \nsecurity and the private sector are a topic of strategic interest of\
    \ some actors in the \nUS government, according to whom the protection of the\
    \ country’s critical infra-\nstructure is a joint task between public and private\
    \ actors4 (DHS, 2015).  \nPerverse incentives \nPrivate companies not only contribute\
    \ to the development of core information \ntechnologies; they concurrently play\
    \ an important role in the production of security \nin the virtual domain, either\
    \ by developing software and hardware, by running \nonline platforms and networks\
    \ or by commercializing products and solutions to \nmake the online experience\
    \ more ‘secure.’ Technology development and the \nsecurity concerns that follow\
    \ are symbiotic in the sense that together with the \ndevelopment of information\
    \ technologies comes the development (or not) of \nsecurity solutions for the\
    \ use of these technologies. \nPerverse incentives refer to the negative outcomes\
    \ of the interaction between \neconomics and computer security, on one hand, and\
    \ of the political and market \nchoices of companies, on the other. They are also\
    \ related to the structure and \nfunctioning of most IT markets, which are marked\
    \ by the competitive development \nof applications and by corporate warfare. To\
    \ either entrench or undermine \nmonopolies, companies have had a tendency to\
    \ develop flawed systems with an \nobscure architecture, or rather opted for ‘security\
    \ by obscurity’ in order to increase \nthe investment that competitors might make\
    \ to create compatible products. The \npolitics of product development are one\
    \ aspect of these incentives. But in this \ncompetitive environment, companies\
    \ have also, for some time, opted for feeding an \n                          \
    \                                 \n4The DHS coordinates the information sharing\
    \ between federal agencies and the private sector, \nstressing the strong interdependency\
    \ of infrastructure systems across the US, both virtual and physi-\ncal. \nPUC-Rio\

    \ the basis that in the complex universe of cyber-\nspace, offense tends to be\
    \ easier than defense (ANDERSON, 2001).     \nThe market in which these companies\
    \ act is diversified and includes \ncommercial, governmental, organizational and\
    \ individual customers, all of which, \nto different degrees, sustain their own\
    \ interests and practices regarding cyber \nsecurity and the usability of cyberspace.\
    \ The market is a core part of the field of \ncyber security, and is particularly\
    \ important in that it is the locus of most of the \npractices that produce and\
    \ shape its contours.    \nDivision of the work \nTo give the reader a robust\
    \ understanding of the dynamics and implications \nof current practices in the\
    \ cyber security market, the work will be divided in four \nchapters. In a first\
    \ moment (chapters 1 and 2), the idea is to familiarize the reader \nwith the\
    \ research strategy, as well as with the theoretical and historical accounts of\
    \ \nthe research object. In a second moment (chapter 3), the intention is to present\
    \ the \nempirical application of the concepts and the context explored in chapters\
    \ 1 and 2 \nto the reader. Then, the work discusses the tendencies manifested\
    \ in the practices \nof the companies analyzed (chapter 4). Lastly, (chapter 5),\
    \ the work develops a \ncritical analysis of the implications, for cyber security,\
    \ of the practices of cyber \nsecurity companies and the political arrangements\
    \ between these actors and \ngovernment agencies. This way, the aim is to provide\
    \ the reader with an \nunderstanding of the contributions of a Bourdieu-inspired\
    \ approach to cyber \nsecurity and to international relations, as well as an overview,\
    \ followed by a critical \nanalysis, of the consequences of the practices adopted\
    \ by agents struggling within \nthis field.   \nThe first chapter discusses the\
    \ theoretical framework of the dissertation. This \nframework involves a double\
    \ investigation: firstly, on the contribution of private \nsecurity studies for\
    \ understanding the practices of private companies in cyber \nsecurity; and, secondly,\
    \ on the relevance of Bourdieu’s sociology as an analytical \nground for making\
    \ sense of these agents’ practices, the struggles they become \ninvolved with\
    \ and the nature of other actors within the cyber security field (sections \n\
    2.5. and 2.6.). The main argument developed in the course of the chapter is that\
    \ \nBourdieu’s sociological theory is relevant for making sense of the working\
    \ and \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n22 \nimplications of private\
    \ security in international relations (IR), on the one hand, and \nof the dynamics\
    \ within the field of cyber security, on the other. A reading of cyber \nsecurity\
    \ as a social ‘field’ or ‘champ,’ where agents struggle for political influence,\
    \ \nallows visualizing how the practices of private companies within it are constituted\
    \ \nby attempts to influence, through their services, advertisement, risk-oriented\
    \ prac-\ntices and discourses, the politics of the field. In what concerns the\
    \ contributions to \nprivate security studies, the “thinking tools” and the Bourdieusian\
    \ sociological \napproach are fruitful for visualizing the patterns of conflict\
    \ and cooperation among \nprivate companies and governments that often escape\
    \ the conventional reading of \n‘privatization,’ as the transfer away of security\
    \ functions from the government to \nthe private sector. \n In this regard, the\
    \ chapter employs the concept of marketization of security \nas an alternative\
    \ to the conceptual limitations of the term ‘privatization’, as the \nformer embraces\
    \ more complex arrangements between public and private agents \nwithin the context\
    \ of international security (section 2.2.). The central argument for \nthe term\
    \ marketization is that it makes possible the analysis of the hybrid relations\
    \ \nbetween public and private actors and of the implications of such enmeshment.\
    \ \nSubsequently, the chapter analyzes the formation of “industrial complexes,”\
    \ or \nalliances between governments and private industry, as a direct implication\
    \ of these \ndynamics (section 2.3.) and investigates the correlation between\
    \ private security \nand cyber security, sustaining that the phenomenon of the\
    \ “marketization” of \nsecurity has been important in this context, once the technologies\
    \ that anchor cyber \nsecurity have been developed in a ‘hybrid’ context of public-private\
    \ initiatives and \narrangements, and these patterns have marked the formulation\
    \ and application of \ncyber security policies in the United States (section 2.4.).\
    \  \nThe chapter also situates the private security debate within the context\
    \ of \nsecurity studies in IR (section 2.1.). Processes of broadening and deepening\
    \ of \n‘security’ are open contestations to dominant readings of the discipline,\
    \ and allowed \nthe involvement of a variety of subjects and objects to the realm\
    \ of international \nsecurity, including both the debates over private security\
    \ and over cyberspace as a \nsource of (national and international) insecurity.\
    \  \nThe second chapter analyzes the evolution of ICTs and the perceptions that\
    \ \nhave been built to make sense of their impact on society. The process of sketching\
    \ \nthe history of information technologies is important for apprehending the\
    \ space of \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n23 \npositions and\
    \ position-taking in the field of cyber security, as well as a necessary \nstep\
    \ in the identification of the background knowledge that sustains and gives sense\
    \ \nto the practice of the agents within the field of cyber security. For such\
    \ purpose, the \nchapter analyzes the information society thesis and its treatment\
    \ within the disci-\npline of IR (section 3.1.). The argument is that the attempts\
    \ made by exponents of \nthe thesis to make sense of technological changes have\
    \ contributed to reshaping \nsecurity thinking, by altering fundamental perceptions\
    \ about the nature of security \nthreats. The chapter shows that the private sector\
    \ has played an important role in \nthis sense, as the exponential development\
    \ of computer and networked technologies \nand their diffusion to society have\
    \ been closely related to the 1980s privatization of \ncybernetic technologies.\
    \ But these technologies have not been simply privatized: \nfrom their inception,\
    \ the process that best describes their evolution is that of \nmarketization.\
    \ As it will be argued, the development of ICTs has been marked by \nan interesting\
    \ combination of public funding and private initiative, on the one hand, \nand\
    \ its diffusion has been boosted by the commercialization of such technologies,\
    \ \non the other (section 3.2.). \nThe central argument of the chapter is that\
    \ ICTs and the perceptions of their \nimpacts on society are part of a broader\
    \ effort to legitimate the cyber security \nmarket. These two phenomena have contributed\
    \ to fundament and boost existent \nregimes of justification in cyber security.\
    \ As the argument goes, it is sustained that \nthe strong presence of the market\
    \ in the development and operation of information \ntechnologies strongly influences\
    \ how to think and conceive the security issues that \narise because of them.\
    \ The debate on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) \nillustrates very well\
    \ this phenomenon, as it has been associated with threats coming \nfrom and because\
    \ of cyberspace (section 3.3.). The association between critical \ninfrastructure\
    \ and information technologies has been fundamental to the cyber \nsecurity debate,\
    \ as it relies on a vision of threats associated to risks and \nvulnerabilities\
    \ in informational systems. \n The CIP debate is also helpful in situating the\
    \ place of risk in the field of \ncyber security. The chapter argues that risk-based\
    \ thinking is part of the background \nknowledge that orients agents’ practices\
    \ in the field, and has become almost insepa-\nrable from cyber security, which\
    \ has been marked by a confluence of distinct, but \ncomplementary, positions\
    \ regarding uncertainty (section 3.4.). The marketization \nof ICTs is strategic\
    \ in that it has contributed to the centrality of risk-based thinking \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n24 \nwithin cyber security. This naturalization\
    \ of threat-assessment in terms of risks, in \nturn, sets forth the possibility\
    \ for agents invested with the power to mobilize risk-\nbased arguments to play\
    \ a central role in the characterization and definition of what \nconstitutes\
    \ a threat and what constitutes a necessary measure to strengthen security. \n\
    The third chapter is the empirical part of the work. It analyzes mainly what \n\
    the work addresses as the ‘cyber security market.’ This market is deeply entangled\
    \ \nto the very field of cyber security and the practices that take place in its\
    \ context can \ndirectly alter the perceptions towards security in cyberspace,\
    \ privacy and interna-\ntional security (for example, when companies commercialize\
    \ military, ICT \nsolutions with governments for purposes of policing and war-making).\
    \ The main \nobjective is to situate the practices of private companies within\
    \ the field of cyber \nsecurity. For that purpose, the chapter applies the theory\
    \ discussed in the previous \nchapters to initially provide a mapping of the struggles\
    \ within the field. This \ninvolves the identification of the main agents concerned,\
    \ their positions and \ninterests and the conflicts between them (section 4.1).\
    \ The aim is to give the reader \na situational framing of the existent struggles\
    \ in the field in the recent years, as well \nas a visualization of the most relevant\
    \ and influential practices of agents. This \nscenario helps capturing some of\
    \ the most central points of convergence and \ndivergence between agents, as well\
    \ as the way by which these agreements and \ndisagreements contribute to shaping\
    \ cyber security.  \nIn a second moment (section 4.2.), the chapter is dedicated\
    \ to analyzing the \npractices of three categories of private companies: antivirus\
    \ or endpoint security \ncompanies, cyber security companies and defense contractors\
    \ providing cyber \nsecurity services. It analyzes the practices of traditional\
    \ businesses and new start-\nups alike, considering the extent of their relationship\
    \ with governments and other \ncompanies in the process. The main argument is\
    \ that it is important to pay attention \nto the practices of these companies\
    \ in order to understand the functioning of the \ncyber security market. It is\
    \ through practices enacted in this market that these \ncompanies may actually\
    \ produce cyber security and, thus, influence the dynamics \nin the cyber security\
    \ field. \nIn the analysis of the advertisements of companies’ products and services,\
    \ \nthree dominant approaches to cyber security are identified: defensive security,\
    \ \noffensive security and active defense. These three forms of security are marked\
    \ by \nthe kind of approach they make to risk and uncertainty. The chapter analyzes\
    \ the \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n25 \ncharacteristics of\
    \ these forms of security in the context of the companies and solu-\ntions that\
    \ support each. The predominance of active defense in the solutions’ \nportfolio\
    \ was a pattern found in the research.  \nThe fourth chapter analyzes the patterns\
    \ the work has found, as well as their \nimplications for the idea of security.\
    \ The aforementioned approaches to cyber \nsecurity are a manifestation of the\
    \ disputes between private companies in the field, \nand serve as strategies for\
    \ assuring a place in the market (section 5.1.). These \ndisputes are also evident\
    \ in the arguments for a certain solution, rather than the \nothers (subsection\
    \ 5.1.1.). The argument is that opting for active defense based \nsolutions is\
    \ strategic to the companies’ relation with state-actors, particularly \nbecause\
    \ it relies mostly on an anticipatory, prevention-focused, approach to security\
    \ \n(subsection 5.2.1.). Active defense is marked by near-offensive measures against\
    \ \nan intrusion as a justification for enhancing the possibility of anticipating\
    \ potential \nattacks. These measures include, but are not restricted to: geolocalization\
    \ and IP \ntracking, threat intelligence gathering and intelligence, broadly speaking;\
    \ \nannoyance measures so as to induce the attacker to commit mistakes; and offensive\
    \ \nmeasures that include hacking back. As argued in subsection 5.1.3., the \n\
    predominance of this approach is further facilitated by the entanglement between\
    \ \ngovernments and private companies, once that the established bridges between\
    \ the \ntwo spheres have contributed to the sharing of threat-perceptions and\
    \ potential \nsecurity solutions. \n The chapter also establishes the argument\
    \ that active defense has further \nimplications for the concept of security (section\
    \ 5.2.). It can be regarded as a \nsecurity paradigm that authorizes the adoption\
    \ of security measures as a form of \nrisk anticipation, and is rooted on the\
    \ utopic dream of a riskless cyberspace. \nThe fifth and concluding chapter casts\
    \ a critical analysis of the tendencies \nidentified in the third and fourth chapters.\
    \ Its main focus is on the implications of \nthe marketization of security in\
    \ cyberspace for security and privacy. The chapter \npays a particular attention\
    \ to the relationship between private companies and \ngovernments and analyzes\
    \ the implications of this relationship in the form of \npolitical arrangements\
    \ between these actors. As a result from the analysis carried \nout in chapter\
    \ three, it identifies two particular arrangements: one between the cyber \nsecurity\
    \ industry properly said (which includes cyber security companies, the \nantivirus\
    \ industry and defense contractors) and the government; and the other \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n26 \nbetween other kinds of information\
    \ technology companies, \nsuch as \ntelecommunication companies and internet/online\
    \ service providers (ISPs and \nOSPs). These arrangements vary in their nature\
    \ (as the first one is strongly marked \nby cooperation and the second marked\
    \ by more conflicting relations) and in the way \nsecurity is produced by private\
    \ companies in each case (section 6.2).   \nIn the chapter, it is argued that\
    \ the struggles to assert power over the internet \nhave resulted in or reinforced\
    \ these political arrangements between private compa-\nnies and governments. The\
    \ main concern is with how those arrangements seeking \nto explore the potentials\
    \ of offensive or near-offensive cyber security solutions \naffect security and\
    \ privacy in cyberspace, as well as with the implications for \ninternational\
    \ security.  \nThe relationship between cyber security and markets is analyzed\
    \ at the \nbeginning of the chapter (section 6.1.). By taking the current approaches\
    \ to cyber \nsecurity as a part of a paradigm of security based on securing ‘fluxes’\
    \ (of people, \nof information, and so on), the chapter explores the three consequences\
    \ of this \nparadigm. Firstly, the strong logic of the market is part of the provision\
    \ of cyber \nsecurity and has contributed to its commodification, contributing\
    \ to establishing a \n‘culture of fear’ over cyber threats; secondly, it leads\
    \ to a differentiation in the \nprovision of security based on costs, in which\
    \ the efficacy is amenable to how much \none can pay to have it; and thirdly,\
    \ involves the constitution of public-private \narrangements in cyber security\
    \ policy-making.  \nThe chapter calls attention to the impacts of these struggles\
    \ both in the U.S. \nfield and beyond. The argument is that the networked nature\
    \ of current information \ntechnology devices makes this field particularly relevant\
    \ in a global scale. The \nstruggles and their particular outcomes in the U.S.\
    \ context may affect other parts of \nthe world, as it happened with the revelations\
    \ of the NSA’s global surveillance \nprogram (section 6.3.). Companies originally\
    \ operating within the U.S. field expand \nto other parts of the globe to seize\
    \ lucrative opportunities, some of which are not \nexactly legal or morally acceptable\
    \ in their host countries.   \nThe consequences of these tendencies to global\
    \ governance are also addressed \nin the chapter (subsection 6.2.1.). It is argued\
    \ that in the long term, it becomes \ndifficult to visualize any of the identified\
    \ actors actually controlling the internet by \nthemselves. Thus, there is a tendency\
    \ that existent political arrangements between \nrelevant and powerful actors\
    \ in the field prevail or be slightly modified to \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n27 \naccommodate certain conflictive interests. The chapter shows\
    \ that the broader \ntendency in internet governance is that it keeps being marked\
    \ by a tension between \nattempts to assure the uninterrupted flow of information\
    \ and attempts to filter, con-\ntrol and interrupt it and urges for a more careful\
    \ attention to the political \narrangements underneath such tensions.   \nCyber\
    \ security has become a pressing security concern in many countries, \nwith the\
    \ U.S. on the lead. The marketization of computer technologies, with the \npublic\
    \ funding and private development that accompanied their development, and \nthe\
    \ security concerns that became crescent with their diffusion into society, have\
    \ \nset the stage for the formation of political arrangements oriented to mitigating\
    \ the \nvulnerabilities and risks perceived as inherent aspects of computer technologies.\
    \ \nThe process of broadening the object of security in the field of security\
    \ studies \nwithin IR has enabled for the topic to be a part of the debates in\
    \ the discipline. The \ninherent vulnerabilities in systems and the risk of internal/external\
    \ interruption of \ninformational fluxes, materialized in the CIP debate, seem\
    \ to be now pressing \nsecurity concerns that could not only affect a given territory,\
    \ but also diffuse \nglobally. A new paradigm of security, anchored on a risk-based\
    \ thinking and on \nattempts to secure information fluxes, reinforces the position\
    \ that cyber security has \nacquired in security debates both in policy-making\
    \ circles and in the academia. The \nparticipation of the markets in the production\
    \ of security practices, however, raises \nfundamental issues concerning existent\
    \ accountability mechanisms, something that \nshould not remain obscured by a\
    \ hyped perception of cyber threat.  \n \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    \ \n2. The relevance of Bourdieusian thinking tools for un-\nderstanding private\
    \ security \n \nThe present chapter undergoes an analysis of Bourdieu’s thinking\
    \ tools and \ntheir relevance for understanding the practices of private companies\
    \ in what \nconcerns cyber security. For this purpose, it will be divided into\
    \ two main sections \nthat will discuss, consecutively, the contributions of private\
    \ security studies in \nsituating the practices of private companies in the field\
    \ of cyber security and how \nthe Bourdieusian thinking tools can offer a rich\
    \ analytical ground for understanding \nthe practices of private actors in cyber\
    \ security.   \nThe first part of the chapter situates the place of private studies\
    \ in IR theory \nand security studies and argues that processes of broadening\
    \ and deepening of \nsecurity have benefited the latter field by opening up a\
    \ disciplinary space for \ndebates about private security. Then, the chapter introduces\
    \ the concept of \nmarketization of security as an alternative analytical tool\
    \ to the idea of privatization, \nby arguing that ‘marketization’ not only makes\
    \ it possible to better capture the \nobject of the present research, but also\
    \ provides a better understanding of the shifts \nin global governance highlighted\
    \ by the specialized literature on private security \nand of their implications.\
    \ Next, among these implications the work highlights how \nthe formation of industrial\
    \ complexes, which encompasses complex and often \nhybrid relationships between\
    \ governmental agencies and private companies, is an \nimportant aspect of marketization\
    \ and of the concurrent phenomenon of \nhybridization between the public and the\
    \ private. Finally, it situates cyber security \nin the private security debate,\
    \ underlying the relevance of the concepts employed \nin the work for understanding\
    \ the role of private companies in this specific arena.    \nThe second part of\
    \ the chapter explores Bourdieusian sociology, its \ncontributions to thinking\
    \ about ‘practices’ and analyzes two thinking tools the thesis \nwill primarily\
    \ work with: champ5 and capital. In what concerns private security \nstudies,\
    \ authors like Leander (2014) and Bigo (2011a) have employed Boutrdieu’s\n   \
    \                                                        \n5Bourdieu’s notion\
    \ of field (champ, in French) does not always coincide with the most common use\
    \ \nof the word “field” to refer to a certain area of the human activity. It is\
    \ possible for one to speak of \n“the field of IR” and refer to either the set\
    \ of works that make the discipline or, distinctly, to the \nfield of IR, in a\
    \ Bourdieusian sense, to make sense about the social dynamics and struggles for\
    \ a \nspecific stake within IR. To avoid further confusion, the word “field” in\
    \ this work refers to the area \nof human activity, whilst the word champ is used\
    \ to the Bourdieusian notion of field. \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    29 \nrationale and concepts to question the public/private dichotomy that marks\
    \ studies \nconcerning the practices of private security/military companies and\
    \ state \nbureaucracies alike and to take current security governance as a complex\
    \ \nenmeshment between the public and the private. Reading the practices of private\
    \ \nactors in terms of champ and capital allows thinking outside the ‘black box’\
    \ of the \nnation state and picturing a distinct (transnational) dynamic of security\
    \ in which \nhybridization is a ubiquitous trend (BIGO, 2011b).  \nIt is argued\
    \ that looking at cyber security as a champ makes possible capturing \nthe attempts\
    \ of private companises to gain influence through their services, \nadvertisement\
    \ and risk-oriented practices and discourses. Bourdieusian thinking \ntools give\
    \ a different reading of the involvement of private and state actors in cyber\
    \ \nsecurity. This is a complex involvement marked by patterns of competition\
    \ and \ncooperation not only between private actors themselves, but also between\
    \ private \nactors and state bureaucracies. At stake is the definition or delimitation\
    \ of what \nconstitutes a ‘risk’ to cyber security. This ‘act of naming’ (BERLING,\
    \ 2012; \nBOURDIEU, 1990) is important because, for private companies, it grants\
    \ access to \nthe cyber security market. Moreover, precisely because of this definitional\
    \ power, \ncyber security also works as a regime of justification (BOURDIEU, 1998;\
    \ 2004) \nfor distinct market practices aiming at ‘strengthening’ the security\
    \ of software, data \nand critical infrastructure.  \n2.1. \nIR theory and Private\
    \ Security Studies  \nPrivate security initially had little space in IR debut\
    \ as a disciplinary field. \nThe imaginary of the discipline has been strongly\
    \ tied to the notion of the nation \nstate, as have been the concepts of anarchy\
    \ and sovereignty (WALKER, 2006). \nRealist theory takes this political entity\
    \ as its primary object and its worldview is \nbased \non \na \ndistinction \n\
    between \ninternal \nand \ninternational \npolitics \n(MORGENTHAU, 2002; GUZZINI,\
    \ 1998; WALTZ, 1979). This distinction has \ncontributed to foster a very specific\
    \ political imaginary associated with the most \nfundamental set of Realist assumptions,\
    \ composed by an anarchical international \nsystem in which states, portrayed\
    \ as rational actors, seek to maximize their security \nand situate themselves\
    \ in a never-ending competition with other states. Most of \nthese conditions\
    \ were taken as objective sources of autonomy in the field. As \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n30 \nGuzzini (1998) notes, the confusion between the\
    \ discipline of IR and Realism was \nonly possible because the latter was understood\
    \ as a theory that contributed to \ndistinguish IR from other social sciences.\
    \  \nThe fundamental set of Realist assumptions was questioned by scholars in\
    \ IR \nbecause of their analytical insufficiency for capturing a set of other\
    \ relevant \nphenomena for international politics and the political life, as well\
    \ as the limitations \nit imposed to the political imagination (ASHLEY, 1988;\
    \ WALKER, 2006). These \nassumptions were epistemologically anchored in the common\
    \ sense that IR should \nbe studied considering the existence of objective facts;\
    \ the rejection of theories if \nnew observations were inconsistent with the expectations\
    \ created by them, and that, \nfor any problem-domain, there would always be an\
    \ adequate theory (CHERNOFF, \n2007). This ‘scientific’ vision of IR, as vindicated\
    \ by Realism, served in turn as a \nblind spot for the role of realist theorizing\
    \ in shaping and being shaped by US \ninternational policy concerns and scholarly\
    \ criteria of social science (GUZZINI, \n1998). \nState-centrism in Realist theory\
    \ was initially questioned by liberal pluralists \nin the 1970s, in what Hobson\
    \ (2003) terms the ‘first state debate.’ The neo-realist \nassumption of the state\
    \ as a rational, coherent and autonomous actor with a focus \non the high politics\
    \ of ‘security’ was questioned in face of a perception of a higher \nfocus on\
    \ the ‘low politics’ of economics, distribution and welfare over military \nsecurity.\
    \ For liberal pluralists, international interdependence led to a fragmentation\
    \ \n(and sometimes weakening) of the state in relation to non-state actors (especially\
    \ \nmultinational corporations) (see also KEOHANE e NYE, 1987; 1998).  \n‘Reflectivist’\
    \ approaches6 to IR, in turn, offered a critical view of the role of \nthe state\
    \ and anarchy as objective conditions in the international system, providing \n\
    distinct angles for understanding this controversial but long established political\
    \ \nentity. These approaches laid the groundwork for questioning the very prominence\
    \ \nof the State in the field and are constitutive of what Hobson terms the ‘second\
    \ state \n                                                           \n6Those\
    \ approaches which fall into the ‘reflectivist’ category tend to challenge the\
    \ dominant, scien-\ntific view of how IR should be best studied and to rule out\
    \ the possibility of objective knowledge in \nthe field. Also termed ‘Critical’,\
    \ they are usually not oriented to problem solving and most of them \navoid ‘prediction’\
    \ on the basis that social facts are distinguishable from natural facts. Reflexivity\
    \ \nworks as a double process of self-consciousness of one’s own historical time\
    \ and place and how \nboth determine the questions at stake and as an effort to\
    \ understand the historical dynamics of the \nconditions in which these questions\
    \ came into being. For more discussions on critical theory in IR \nand the opposition\
    \ between scientific and reflectivist approaches, see Devetak (2005) and Chernoff\
    \ \n(2007). \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n31 \ndebate’ (HOBSON,\
    \ 2003). The author contends that the first debate provides an \ninadequate framework\
    \ for understanding IR theory and its various approaches to \nthe state, once\
    \ it reifies international structure over the ‘state-as-agent’ theorization \n\
    (HOBSON, 2003:217). The second debate, on the other hand, would be interesting\
    \ \ninsofar it locates IR theory within the agent-structure problematic.  \nThese\
    \ state debates in IR were strongly influenced by other social sciences. \nAs\
    \ Hobson (2003) observed, there has been a parallel between emerging debates in\
    \ \nthe disciplines of Sociology, Comparative Political Economy and IR. This parallel\
    \ \nis also observed in the ‘shift’ to the ‘second state debate’ away from a state-centric\
    \ \nversus society centric perspective. Attention to how state power derives from\
    \ their \nembeddedness in society and to the co-constitution between state and\
    \ society be-\ncame central.   \nThe challenge to the ‘scientific’ view of IR\
    \ and its fundamental assumptions \nhad implications for the concept of security,\
    \ which provision is a function that has \nbeen traditionally associated with\
    \ the state (FOUCAULT, 2007; ELIAS, 2000). \nThey indicate that theory has struggled\
    \ to expand its comprehension of the \ncomplexity of real world instead of sustaining\
    \ political and social reifications of \neither ‘structures’ or ‘agents.’ The\
    \ objective image of the state as a unit in an \nanarchical international system\
    \ came under scrutiny, as well as the premises that \nunderpinned this worldview.\
    \ Additionally, critical accounts of the role of theory in \nshaping social reality\
    \ opened the way for theoretical considerations of topics \nbeyond the state-as-structure\
    \ and military power, and also they helped in building \na bridge for IR to have\
    \ a better dialogue with other social science disciplines.  \nSecurity studies,\
    \ in particular, have benefited from this environment of \ncontestation of the\
    \ ‘bases’ of IR theory and from theoretical efforts to expand the \ndiscipline’s\
    \ understanding of social reality. Inspired by the methodological \nchallenges\
    \ posed by, broadly speaking, constructivist and post-modern approaches, \ncritical\
    \ approaches to security have contested the categories over which the sub-\nfield\
    \ relied on, in particular the focus on the nation state as a reified entity,\
    \ on the \npredominance of military power over other categories of power, and\
    \ on the idea of \nsecurity as an objective situation necessarily derived from\
    \ the anarchical condition \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n32\
    \ \nof the international system. These contestations led to a substantial broadening7\
    \ and \ndeepening of the main object of security to encompass more than just State-related\
    \ \nand military security issues (ULLMAN, 1983; KRAUSE; WILLIAMS, 1997; \nKRAUSE,\
    \ 1998; BOOTH, 2007; BUZAN e HANSEN, 2009). Mainstream, realist-\ninspired assumptions\
    \ were criticized by what Krause and Williams (1997) term \ncritical security\
    \ studies8 – a broad field that accounts for distinct approaches to \nsecurity,\
    \ threat construction and production and their shifts over time and space. \n\
    Nye’s (2004) account of the concept of US national security is representative\
    \ \nof the nature of some of the main contestations that ‘security’ has faced\
    \ since early \nattempts to contest the prominence of military threats in security\
    \ politics: \nNational security – the absence of threat to a country’s major values\
    \ – is changing. \nDamage done by climate change or imported viruses can be larger\
    \ in terms of money \nor lives lost than the effects of some wars. Even if one\
    \ frames the definition of \nnational security more narrowly, the nature of military\
    \ security is changing. As the \nUS Commission on National Security in the Twenty-first\
    \ Century pointed out, the \ncountry has not been invaded by foreign armies since\
    \ 1814, and the military is \ndesigned to project force and fight wars far from\
    \ our shores. But the military is not \nwell equipped to protect us against an\
    \ attack on our homeland by terrorists wielding \nweapons of mass destruction\
    \ or mass disruption or even hijacked civil aircraft. Thus \nin July 2001, the\
    \ secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, dropped from the \nPentagon’s planning\
    \ priorities the ability to fight two major regional conflicts and \nelevated\
    \ homeland defense to a higher priority. As the US discovered only a few \nmonths\
    \ later, however, military measures are not a sufficient solution to its \nvulnerabilities\
    \ (NYE, 2004:85). \nPrivate security was introduced into the discipline favored\
    \ by the theoretical \nand meta-theoretical debates that took place in IR theory\
    \ since the mid-1980s and \nthat questioned the position assigned to the state\
    \ and how it was approached by \ntheory. The field’s initial concern was with\
    \ attempts of understanding how \nprivatization transformed the state, particularly\
    \ through perceived shifts in the \nmonopoly of the use of force and its consequences\
    \ for security (LEANDER, 2010; \nsee SINGER, 2002; AVANT, 2005). This involved\

    \ of broadening in a level-of-analysis move. According to the author, broadening\
    \ suggests a \ncritical move instead of a technical and strategic one: the critical\
    \ turn happening through deepening \nis concerned not with turning all politics\
    \ into practices of security, but with interpreting security \nissues as questions\
    \ of political theory. For a more detailed discussion on this specific \nconceptualization\
    \ of broadening, see Booth (2007). \n8 According to Krause (1998) and Krause and\

    \ \nBIGO, 2013; 2015). Further, broadening the notion of privatization, authors\
    \ like \nPetersen and Tjalve (2013) study how security tasks are transferred not\
    \ only to \nprivate actors strictu sensu, but also to all the range of actors\
    \ that do not fit the \ncategory of ‘private companies.’ \n2.2. \nIntroducing\
    \ the idea of “marketization of security” and its \nimplications  \nThe idea of\
    \ a ‘privatization’ of security, which commonly underlies the body \nof studies\
    \ on private security, suggests a shifting away of security governance from \n\
    government to market actors10 (LEANDER, 2010; DUNN CAVELTY, 2016). \nContemporarily,\

    \ became recurrent in IR influenced by the \nsecuritization approach in the mid-1990s.\
    \ The constructivist bias of the securitization school \nsuggests a focus on the\
    \ social construction of threats. The main argument is that an issue does not\
    \ \nbecome a security issue because of its objective reality in relation to the\
    \ referent object, but because \nan actor has defined it as a threat to some object’s\
    \ survival. See Buzan et al. (1998); Balzacq (2011) \nand Huysmans (1998).  \n\
    10 In a first moment, to conceive privatization as a transfer of powers to private\
    \ actors may suggest \nthat power was never in these actors’ hands. This is nothing\
    \ but misleading. As Avant (2005) notes, \nthe private sector has been playing\
    \ a role in providing security for some time. What deserves \nattention is how\
    \ the last two decades faced a growth and enlargement of such a role.  \nPUC-Rio\

    \ 2009). \nDespite having introduced the topic with the term ‘privatization,’\
    \ for seman-\ntical reasons, this work will employ the term ‘marketization’ of\
    \ security to refer to \nthe expanding projection of market actors in the field\
    \ of security. The phenomenon \nof marketization is part of a ‘new public management’\
    \ and refers to the integration \nof competition and price mechanisms into public\
    \ services in order to improve \nstates’ efficiency. Although privatization is\
    \ the most common form of \nmarketization, the latter is not limited to the former.\
    \ Outsourcing, management \ncontracts and market testing are also forms of marketization\
    \ (BEVIR, 2009). This \nmovement is justified by an attempt to better capture\
    \ the main object of the thesis \n– private actors and the cyber security market\
    \ – and by the most common \nimplications of using the term ‘privatization’ to\
    \ refer to a broader attention to the \n‘private’ sphere of the market.    \n\
    The option for the term marketization is a political choice that involves \nrefusing\
    \ the oversimplification implied by talks about the ‘privatization’ of an issue\
    \ \nand the overall idea that markets are dominating what used to be public spaces\
    \ and \nactivities; it is also an attempt to understand the cyber security market\
    \ as marked \nby distinct practices emanated from public and private actors. This\
    \ has important \nconsequences regarding how one should conceive the state and\
    \ its practices and \nallows questioning the state/market separation that is pervasive\
    \ in neoliberal theory.   \nThe cyber security market is dynamical but it is hardly\
    \ restricted to the \nactivities of the private sector. Apprehending the role\
    \ of private companies in cyber \nsecurity through the phenomenon of marketization\
    \ implies recognizing the role of \nstate actors in authorizing market practices\
    \ in a given field, by contracting out a \nwide range of services with market\
    \ actors or sharing the ‘management’ of an issue, \nwithout necessarily having\

    \ a fact that is often \nassociated with the strong private bias of the cyber\
    \ security champ (DUNN \nCAVELTY, 2016).    \n This work takes the development\
    \ of cyber security as a hybrid process \ntriggered by both market practices and\
    \ distinct discourses and practices emanated \nfrom states, think tanks, hackers\
    \ and hacker communities, security experts and \nprivate companies. Despite the\
    \ common understanding that cyber security has been \ndeveloped primarily in the\
    \ private sector (CSIS, 2008; DUNN CAVELTY, 2016), \nfocusing on this process\
    \ without considering how it is part of a broader movement \nwhere actors compete\
    \ to make sense of “security” may implicate in overlooking the \nextent to which\
    \ perceptions and practices related to the concept arose as objects of \nstruggles\
    \ among the aforementioned constellation of actors. The ‘struggle over the \n\
    cyber security market’ dynamics will be discussed in chapter 3. In the moment,\
    \ it \nis important to note that the very idea of marketization of (cyber) security\
    \ suggests \na deepening of neoliberal policies in which decentralization leads\
    \ states to rely on \nfirms as partners in government (LEANDER, 2010).  \nFurthermore,\
    \ the adoption of the term ‘privatization’ risks reducing the scope \nof the public-private\
    \ entanglement that has been formed in some of the most \ninfluential liberal\
    \ states nowadays. The term marketization suggests an analytical \ntool most suitable\
    \ for understanding the meanings of security, delimitations of \nsecurity spaces\
    \ and of the practices of security emanated from public and private \ninstitutions,\
    \ once it takes the role of both kinds of actors in shaping these practices, \n\
    for example, through advertising, regulations, authorizations, contracts, technical\
    \ \nstudies and so on. Thus, instead of focusing specifically in the shifts from\
    \ the \n‘public’ to the ‘private’ – as does the idea of privatization – the idea\
    \ of \nmarketization comprises meaningful shifts in the politics underlying the\
    \ public and \nthe private12 (LEANDER, 2010).      \nThe concept of marketization\
    \ is useful for understanding the way in which \nstates have tried to govern security\
    \ through markets from the end of the Cold War \nto the present (LEANDER, 2008).\
    \ If the current working of Private Security \nCompanies (PSCs), Private Military\

    36 \nwas never a static process where power is transferred from the ‘higher’ authority,\
    \ \nor the state, to the ‘lower’ authority, the market. Whilst concerns with privatization,\
    \ \nthe most extreme form of marketization, are important, they alone are unhelpful\
    \ in \nmaking sense of the broader patterns of relations between private actors\
    \ and states. \nThus, it is important to pay attention to the logic and politics\
    \ of security production \nin light of the functioning of neoliberal and sovereign\
    \ forms of governance in the \nfield of security (LEANDER 2008; BERNDTSSON; STERN,\
    \ 2011).  \nIt is important to note that a common concern underpinning most studies\
    \ \nabout private security is related to the significant transformations in the\
    \ governance \nof security, which has been shifting together with broader changes\
    \ in global \ngovernance (ABRAHANSEM; WILLIAMS, 2009). Whilst the literature on\
    \ private \nsecurity initially focused on issues involving PMCs and the use of\
    \ force by private \nmarket actors (SINGER, 2002; AVANT, 2005; LEANDER, 2005;\
    \ LEANDER; \nVAN MUNSTER, 2007), these changes go beyond the scope of ‘traditional’\
    \ \nsecurity activities, most of which are also related to national defense. \
    \ \nPrivate companies in the field of security do not operate exclusively in the\
    \ \ncontext of armed conflicts, nor are they exclusively related to military functions.\
    \ \nInstead, for a long time, they have been part of everyday security in ‘consolidated\
    \ \nliberal democracies’ (BERNDTSSON; STERN, 2011) and their competences for a\
    \ \nwide range of security functions keep expanding. The U.S. is by far the country\
    \ that \nmost encourages contracting out with private companies, for a diverse\
    \ range of \nservices (BRUNEAU, 2015). As Berndtsson and Stern (2011) contend,\
    \ despite the \ndilemmas posed by PSCs in conflict zones and the attention they\
    \ attract, a distinct, \nless violent, dynamic of security practices occurs globally.\
    \ Thus, “in many societies \nglobally, commercial forms of security are increasingly\
    \ being used to provide \nsecurity and maintain public order in public and semi-public\
    \ places” \n(BERNDTSSON; STERN, 2011:411).   \nAccording to Abrahansem and Leander\
    \ (2016), in IR, a considerable number \nof accounts take private security as\
    \ an implication of the changing geopolitics of \nthe post-Cold War, which includes\
    \ but is not restricted to military downsizing and \nthe end of superpower rivalries.\
    \ The authors, however, suggest that this way of \napproaching the matter hinders\
    \ a series of other factors that have encouraged the \nexpansion of private market\
    \ in security, as is the case of the reorganization of the \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n37 \neconomy and production in the 1970s and the integration\
    \ of ITs to the defense sec-\ntor, in what has become known as Revolution in Military\
    \ Affairs (RMA).  \nThe phenomenal expansion of commercial security activities\
    \ varies from \nguarding functions to risk analysis and surveillance (ABRAHANSEM;\
    \ \nWILLIAMS, 2009). Examples of the current range of private security studies\
    \ and \nthe ubiquity of the activities of private companies are their activities\
    \ in airports \n(BERNDTSSON; STERN, 2011), issues of gender (EICHLER, 2016); activities\
    \ of \nintelligence and surveillance (BALL et al., 2012); cyber security (DUNN\
    \ \nCAVELTY, 2016) and so on. Governments’ attempts to streamline bureaucracies\
    \ \nand tighten welfare budgets, by normalizing privatizations, outsourcing and\
    \ public-\nprivate partnerships, mark the state participation in its own ‘disassembly’.\
    \ In this \nsense, the ‘marketization of security’ is part of a broader restructuring\
    \ of the \n‘public-private’, which started in the last decades of the 20th century\
    \ under the label \nof neoliberalism. The fact that the development of cyber security\
    \ practices occurred \nmostly at the heart of the private sector appears to be\
    \ directly related to this broader \ntendency in global governance (DUNN CAVELTY,\
    \ 2016).   \nIn classical liberal theory, markets and states are exhaustively\
    \ distinguished \none from another, a distinction based on a view of the state\
    \ as the locus of a political, \npower seeking behavior and of the market as the\
    \ locus of an economic, wealth-\nseeking behavior. Liberalism’s ‘renewed’ version,\
    \ neo-liberalism, has fostered an \nopposite trend. The history goes as follows:\
    \ the relationship between markets and \nstates has been one of constant ‘struggles’\
    \ between opposing groups, which initially \nopposed the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie,\
    \ and later capitalism and socialism. But \nthe last decades of the 20th century\
    \ saw social and economic shifts, among \ninflationary shocks, state attempts\
    \ to stabilize markets and the growing importance \nof financial capital, which\
    \ would back neoliberal claims that economic theory was \nable to provide a better\
    \ analysis of public policy than political science (CROUCH, \n2004).  \nNeoliberalism\
    \ starts from the classical liberal state/market separation \nassumption, but\
    \ takes a practical detour. Crouch (2004) shows that political and \neconomic\
    \ systems are vulnerable to particular forms of state-market entanglement, \n\
    as is the case of the relationship between state officials and private firms and\
    \ \nlobbying. Neoclassical economics, which inspired neoliberalism, argues that\
    \ the \nstate, as it is not a market actor, is unable to act rationally and anticipate\
    \ the \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n38 \nconsequences of its\
    \ actions. Remediating this is partly a task of leaving the state out \nof the\
    \ market and partly improving its capacity to become like a firm. Thus, in this\
    \ \nsense,  \nthe neoliberal state defers to business interests; it believes that\
    \ its own internal pro-\ncesses have been discredited by the years of social democratic\
    \ compromise, and \nwishes to clean itself out by borrowing as many practices\
    \ and procedures as possible \nfrom private firms” (CROUCH, 2004:247).  \nThe\
    \ many policies adopted to fulfill such a goal, from privatization and \noutsourcing\
    \ to sharing regulation with firms, point to an ‘erosion’ of the perceived \n\
    boundaries between the state and the market. \nThe aforementioned discussed shifts\
    \ in governance that mark what is \nunderstood as marketization of security matter\
    \ when making sense of ‘security’. \nLeander (2009b) discusses the phenomenon\
    \ of ‘commodification’ of security as an \nimplication of the expansion of private\
    \ security and the aforementioned shifts in \ngovernance that have made the marketization\
    \ of security a widespread tendency. \nShe argues that security is a ‘contested\
    \ commodity’ in the sense that there remains \na fundamental disagreement or “an\
    \ ongoing and unsettled symbolic struggle” \n(LEANDER, 2009b:2) over whether it\
    \ is a commodity in the first place. The \nconsequence of these struggles over\
    \ ‘security as commodity’ is that they influence \nthe organization of markets’\
    \ practices. And,  \nbecause the legitimacy of the market as such is questioned\
    \ and under threat, market \npractices are bound to be organized in ways which\
    \ diminish the significance of this \nthreat and makes the market appear as ‘normal’\
    \ and uncontested as possible. \n(LEANDER, 2009b:4-5).  \nExtremely relevant for\
    \ understanding the critique that will be advanced \nfurther in this work, the\
    \ idea of a spiraling insecurity is one articulated form of \ncontestation of\
    \ the commodification of security and, in some aspects, it is similar \nto Booth\
    \ and Wheeler’s understanding of a possible outcome of IR’s classical \nsecurity\
    \ dilemma13, or a security paradox, in which attempts to increase security \n\
    \                                                           \n13 Herz (1950),\
    \ who coined the term security dilemma, considers that it results of the anarchical\
    \ \ncondition of the international system. His description of the phenomenon follows\
    \ the logic that \ngroups and individuals living in a constellation where anarchy\
    \ reigns have high concerns over their \nown security against attacks and domination\
    \ by other groups/individuals. Striving to attain more \nsecurity, there is a\
    \ tendency for these actors to acquire more power. “This, in turn, renders the\
    \ others \nmore insecure and compels them to prepare for the worst. Since none\
    \ can ever feel entirely secure \nin such a world of competing units, power competition\
    \ ensues, and the vicious circle of security and \npower accumulation is on.”\
    \ (HERZ, 1950:157). According to the author, this dynamic is beyond the \ndiscussions\
    \ over the ‘nature’ of the human being. The notion of security dilemma is at the\
    \ core of \nKenneth Waltz’s (1979) defensive realism. \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n39 \nactually can lead to increasing insecurity14 (BOOTH;\
    \ WHEELER, 2008). In the \ncase of market actors, the main concern is that “those\
    \ selling protection are in reality \nselling protection against threats that\
    \ are more or less a direct consequence of their \nown activities and that these\
    \ sales (…) increase (…) the prevailing insecurity” \n(LEANDER, 2009b:13). The\
    \ securitization strand of the same argument \nemphasizes the role of companies\
    \ in advertising and lobbying for understanding \nspecific issues as threats,\
    \ which induces the same kind of spiral of insecurity \n(LEANDER, 2009b). Market\
    \ reactions to this specific critique consist in arguing \nthat market practices\
    \ are a response to a demand, in the sense that “it is the security \nneeds (of\
    \ states, organizations, private businesses and individuals) pre-existing and\
    \ \nindependent of the company they respond to” (LEANDER, 2009b:14).   \n2.3.\
    \ \n“Hybrid” security and industrial complexes \nAn important implication of the\
    \ marketization of security is related to the \ngrowing enmeshment between the\
    \ practices of public and private actors. In this \nsense, a recent trend in the\
    \ literature concerning private security, drawn from the \ncontestation over the\
    \ public/private distinction, has been to focus on a process of \nhybridization\
    \ of security governance instead of focusing on the transfer away of \nsecurity\
    \ functions to market (LEANDER, 2009c; BIGO, 2013; 2015). This process \nof hybridization\
    \ is sometimes addressed in terms of a security assemblage \n(BERNDTSSON; STERN,\
    \ 2011) or a ‘chimera’ (LEANDER, 2009c; 2014), and it \nrefers to the difficulty\
    \ in understanding the enmeshment between public and private \nactors from the\
    \ point of either ‘the public’ or ‘the private’. The idea has been fruitful \n\
    for understanding the dynamics of the intelligence sector in the U.S. (LEANDER,\
    \ \n2014), of practices of surveillance (BALZACQ, et al., 2010; BIGO, 2011a; 2013;\
    \ \nBAUMAN, et al., 2014) and of the functioning of airport security administration\
    \ \n(BERNDTSSON; STERN, 2011), for example. \n                               \
    \                            \n14 Booth and Wheeler (2008) definition of the security\
    \ dilemma takes it as a two-level strategic \npredicament, where the first level\
    \ corresponds to a dilemma of interpretation, in which actors shall \ndecide over\
    \ whether the perceived military developments are of offensive or defensive nature;\
    \ and \nthe second level corresponds to a dilemma of response, in which actors\
    \ need to determine how to \nreact. The notion of a security paradox arises from\
    \ the latter, in a context where “leaders resolve the \ndilemma of response in\
    \ a manner that creates a spiral of mutual insecurity” (BOOTH; WHEELER, \n2008).\
    \ \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n40 \nA representative trend\
    \ of this hybrid approach to security governance dates \nback to the Cold War\
    \ and the buildup of U.S military-industrial power. The en-\nmeshment between\
    \ practices emanated from the government, on one side, and \ndefense contractors,\
    \ on the other, has been addressed in previous studies (ADAMS, \n1968; LEANDER,\
    \ 2009c; 2014), but very few gave attention to the literature on \n‘industrial\
    \ complexes’, despite addressing its dynamics in more indirect ways.  \n The notion\
    \ of a military-industrial complex gained attention in former U.S \npresident\
    \ Dwight D. Eisenhower’s farewell address, in 1961. On the occasion, \nEisenhower\
    \ warned against an ‘unwarranted influence’ of the conjunction between \nU.S military\
    \ establishment and arms industry (EISENHOWER, 1961). Since then, \na robust body\
    \ of literature has been created to discuss the phenomenon of “industrial \ncomplexes”,\
    \ be they military (EISENHOWER, 1961; ADAMS, 1968; DUNNE; \nSKÖNS, 2011; HARTUNG,\
    \ 2011), or of other diverse nature (DEIBERT, 2011; \n2013; BALL; SNIDER, 2013;\
    \ HARRIS, 2014; see also HARTUNG, 2011).  \nDunne and Sköns (2011) argue that\
    \ the concept lacks analytical strength, but \nis quite valuable as a descriptive\
    \ tool that refers to  \ncoalitions of vested interests within the state and industry,\
    \ which could lead to \ndecisions being made which were in the interest of the\
    \ coalition members and not \nnecessarily in the interests of national security\
    \ (DUNNE; SKÖNS, 2011).   \nThe military-industrial complex is perhaps the classical\
    \ example of this kind \nof political arrangement between state and industries.\
    \ The marketization of security \nfunctions has led to an expansion of the military\
    \ services industry that does not \nnecessarily imply a dominance of the public\
    \ by the private. Governmental action is \nat the heart of Adams’ (1968) account\
    \ of industrial concentration in the late 1960s. \nAccordingly, the formation\
    \ of military-industrial complexes illustrates some of the \npower issues constitutive\
    \ of the “new industrial state”, in which specific \ninstitutional arrangements\
    \ – anchored in defense contracts, support to research and \ndevelopment in the\
    \ private sector, patent policy, tax privileges, subsides, etc. – are \nencouraged\
    \ by government actors seeking to establish alliances with the private \nenterprise.\
    \ Military-industrial complexes are an evident aspect of how the  \ngovernment\
    \ not only permits and facilitates the entrenchment of private power but \nserves\
    \ as its fountain-head. It creates and institutionalizes power concentrations\
    \ \nwhich tend to breed on themselves and to defy public control. (ADAMS, 1968:653).\
    \ \nAdams did not view the complex as a conspiracy between “merchants of \ndeath\
    \ and a band of lusty generals”, to quote the author’s own terms, but as a natural\
    \ \ncoalition of interest groups with stakes in the defense sector that included\
    \ distinct \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n41 \ngovernmental spheres,\
    \ the industry, labor unions, lobbyists and legislators alike \n(ADAMS, 1968:655).\

    arrangement between the market and the state. This includes a geographical disper-\n\
    sion of the US/European supply chains; the restructuring of traditional arms \n\
    producers – many of which have oriented themselves to the cyber security and \n\
    surveillance markets; – the emergence of new companies and new security areas;\
    \ \nand the inversion of the dual use logic for technology from military-to-civilian\
    \ use \nto civilian-to-military use (DUNNE; SKÖNS, 2011). But whilst this may\
    \ have \naltered important components in this political arrangement, the dynamics\
    \ and \nimpact of the vested interests seem to have endured (DUNNE; SKÖNS, 2011).\
    \ \nChomsky (2004) argues that these complexes are, in fact, the core of modern\
    \ \neconomy: they are not necessarily military nor representative of a free-enterprise\
    \ \neconomy. The development of new technologies for the use of the public sector,\
    \ as \nit was the case of the Internet or of the computer, took a while to span\
    \ to the civilian \nmarket. He gives the example of IBM and how, through public\
    \ funds, it was able \nto develop and produce advanced computers for the NSA and\
    \ government agencies, \nstill on the 1960s – curiously, almost paralleling with\
    \ the ending of Eisenhower’s \nterm. \nA meaningful shift has happened in this\
    \ industry with the introduction of new \nsecurity issues to the political agenda.\
    \ In particular, there is a new orientation of \ntraditional and new private companies\
    \ that both directly contract out with \ngovernments or that are located in a\
    \ broader supply chain towards the cyber security \nand surveillance industries\
    \ (HARTUNG, 2011; DEIBERT, 2011; 2013; BALL; \nSNIDER, 2013; HARRIS, 2014). This\
    \ was partially stimulated by the advancement \nof civilian technologies – with\
    \ an emphasis on electronics – in relation to military \nones. As a consequence,\
    \ a distinct dynamic took place in what concerns ICTs:  \ncompanies in the electronics\
    \ and IT sectors, that in the past had little involvement \nwith arms production\
    \ are finding themselves part of the defence industrial base and \nsometimes the\
    \ target of diversification efforts by the major arms producers. \n(DUNNE; SKÖNS,\
    \ 2011:4). \n2.4. \nCyber security and private security \nThe discussion on the\
    \ hybridization of the public/private is very relevant for \nthinking the role\
    \ of the private sector in the champ of cyber security. As Dunn \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n42 \nCavelty and others have noted, the operation of\
    \ both cyberspace and critical infra-\nstructures is distributed among private\
    \ sector’s actors (DUNN CAVELTY, 2007; \nDEIBERT; ROHOZINSKI, 2010), as a direct\
    \ result of the 1970s privatizations. \nExtensive and penetrating surveillance\
    \ systems are legitimized by a legislation and \ncounter terrorist policies that\
    \ remove existing operational constraints and are \nincreasingly operated and\
    \ controlled by private actors instead of the State. The same \ncan be said about\
    \ telecommunications and the role of cyberspace as a \ncommunication environment,\
    \ both of which are usually hosted, operated and \ncontrolled by a distinct mix\
    \ of private companies and public institutions. As Deibert \nand Rohozinski (2010)\
    \ argue, the locus of authority in cyberspace has been shared \nbetween public\
    \ and private spheres and people’s lives are not only mediated \nthrough the state,\
    \ but also dispersed through ICTs owned, operated and exploited \nby private companies.\
    \ \nThe operation of these actors in and through cyberspace varies. Companies\
    \ \nspecialized in commercializing offensive ‘cyber warfare’ and surveillance\
    \ \ntechnologies, or what Deibert (2013) calls “shadowy security services”, are\
    \ \namongst the variety of private companies that operate in and through cyberspace.\
    \ \nThis particular burgeoning group includes some of the biggest defense companies\
    \ \nin the United States (U.S), most of which in recent years have oriented themselves\
    \ \nto the lucrative cyber security market.  \nThe perception that distinct, complex\
    \ threats arise from cyberspace and inside \nit, and the concurrent attempts to\
    \ militarize it (DUNN CAVELTY, 2012; 2013; \nDEIBERT, 2011) fuel a multibillionaire\
    \ market with an estimated value of US$150 \nbillion annually (DEIBERT, 2013),\
    \ that includes companies advertising cyber \nsecurity solutions that go far beyond\
    \ conventional antivirus protection. In a trend \nthat seems to emulate the involvement\
    \ of private companies in military/security \nissues, new companies and big, traditional\
    \ defense contractors orient themselves \ntowards serving the growing pressure\
    \ to secure cyberspace. As the literature on the \nmilitary-industrial complex\
    \ made clear, this cyber security or internet military-\nindustrial complex, as\
    \ Deibert (2011; 2013) and Harris (2014) term it, is in direct \nconnection with\
    \ governmental instances in the U.S., to the point that it becomes \ndifficult\
    \ to dissociate the public and the private in the ocean of public-private \npartnerships\
    \ that are invoked as a solution to the pernicious insecurity of \ncyberspace.\
    \  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n43 \nThe link between private\
    \ security studies and the role of private actors in \ncyber security is not always\
    \ easily established in IR works. Both traditional and \ncritical security studies\
    \ in IR have failed to adequately assess the central role of \nprivate companies\
    \ in cyber security. As Dunn Cavelty notes, “while private security \nactors play\
    \ an important role in all forms of cyber-aggression and countermeasures, \nthis\
    \ topic is a non-issue in the emerging literature.” (DUNN CAVELTY, 2016:93). \n\
    Research in economics of information security, on the other hand, has dealt with\
    \ \nthis object in a more satisfactory fashion (see DUNN CAVELTY, 2016; \nANDERSON,\
    \ 2001).   \nThe literature on Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) gives a good\
    \ account of \nthe dynamics of the public and the private in what concerns cyber\
    \ security. Seen as \na panacea for the issue of cyber security, PPPs still find\
    \ obstacles that range from \nthe difficulty of governments sharing sensitive\
    \ information to the concern of com-\npanies with their reputation if they share\
    \ information about their own vulnerabilities \n(DUNN CAVELTY, 2016). But most\
    \ importantly, it should be noted that PPPs \nseem to be but one kind of answer\
    \ to a perceived difficulty in providing security \nfrom one standpoint only,\
    \ be it ‘the public’ or ‘the private’. \nAs a matter of conclusion, it is important\
    \ to observe that what most of the \ndistinct ideas underlying the critique to\
    \ the public/private divide as a starting point \nhave in common is a theoretical\
    \ background inspired by Bourdieusian sociology \n(LEANDER 2009c; 2014; BIGO,\
    \ 2013; 2015) – with a notable exception of those \nwho employ the Deleuzian notion\
    \ of assemblage (ABRAHANSEN; WILLIAMS, \n2009; BERNDTSSON; STERN, 2011). By employing\
    \ distinct conceptual tools, \nthese studies have approached issues of international\
    \ security and private security \nin a distinct and original fashion, and posed\
    \ important questions regarding the \npractices that together constitute security\
    \ governance  \nFrom this moment on, the chapter will address the contributions\
    \ of the \nBourdieusian theory for the theorization of “practices” in the social\
    \ world. The next \nsection will briefly present the so-called ‘practice turn’\
    \ in IR and discuss the \nimplications of thinking in terms of practices. Then,\
    \ the following section will \nanalyze the thinking tools developed by Pierre\
    \ Bourdieu, with a special attention to \nthe ideas of champ and capital. In the\
    \ course of the section, a dialogue between \nBourdieu’s concepts and their application\
    \ to cyber security will be established. \nThinking the practices of private actors\
    \ in terms of champ and capital allows a \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    44 \nvisualization of the complex dynamics and practices of security in consonance\
    \ to \nthe concept of marketization here employed. These understandings further\
    \ \nfundament the way our conceptualization the champ of cyber security and of\
    \ the \nstrategies of private sector in it. \n2.5. \nPractice theory and the practice\
    \ turn in IR \nThis section will briefly address the theoretical and methodological\
    \ path the \nwork has undergone by focusing on the practices of private actors\
    \ and discussing \nits implications. Up to now, the word ‘practice’ has been unduly\
    \ employed without \nany further consideration of what does exactly mean to speak\
    \ of it and what are the \nimplications of paying attention to ‘practices’.  \
    \ \nAccording to Reckwitz (2002), practice theory is a unifying label to a group\
    \ \nof approaches interested in how social beings make and transform the social\
    \ world. \nIt focuses on the routine and performativity of social action, as well\
    \ as on its \ndependence on tacit knowledge and implicit understanding. The author\
    \ argues that \nexponents of contemporary practice theory share a common viewpoint\
    \ indebted to \ncultural theory, as they recognize the blind spot shared by theories\
    \ grounded on the \nclassical figures of the homo economicus and the homos sociologicus\
    \ in the sense \nof “they both dismiss the implicit, tacit or unconscious layer\
    \ of knowledge which \nenables a symbolic organization of reality” (RECKWITZ,\
    \ 2002:246). \nPractices can be collective, in the sense of being “both structured\
    \ and acted \nout by communities of practice, and by the diffusion of background\
    \ knowledge \nacross agents in these communities, which similarly disposes them\
    \ to act in \ncoordination” (ADLER; POULIOT, 2011:8). Adler and Pouliot (2011)\
    \ call these \ncollective practices ‘corporate practices.’ The notion of corporate\
    \ practices can be \nwell-adjusted in order to understand the practices of state\
    \ bureaucracies and private \ncompanies, for example. In most cyber security companies,\
    \ CEOs and engineers \nshared a common background knowledge of code and computing\
    \ that informs \npartially or totally the policies, product development and other\
    \ practices of the \ncompany.  \nIn IR, the practice ‘turn’ is based on the idea\
    \ that it is necessary to pay \nattention to the everyday life’s practices in\
    \ order to understand dynamics of order \nand change (BUEGER; GARDINGR, 2015).\
    \ Initially influenced by the \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    45 \npoststructuralist critique, works focusing on the importance of practices\
    \ to under-\nstand world politics gained strength among IR scholars (see NEUMANN,\
    \ 2002; \nJACKSON, 2008; POULIOT, 2008; ADLER; POULIOT, 2011; ADLER-NISSEN, \n\
    2013), with some theoretical disagreements among them about what constitutes \n\
    practice theory. For example, there is a strong influence of Pierre Bourdieu’s\
    \ work \nin IR’s practice turn (JACKSON, 2008; POULIOT, 2008; POULIOT; MÉRAND,\
    \ \n2013; BIGO, 2013; BERLING, 2013; ADLER-NISSEN, 2013;), as well as critique\
    \ \nagainst equating practice theory to Bourdieu’s work (BUEGER; GARDINGR, \n\
    2015; for non-Bourdieusian approaches to practice theory see also: SCHATZKI; \n\
    KNORR-CETINA; SAVIGNY, 2001). \nAs Bueger and Gradingr (2015) themselves note,\
    \ there has been a degree of \ncompatibility between Bourdieu’s concern about\
    \ domination and IR’s historical \nconcern about power relations, conflicts and\
    \ hierarchical structures, and a \ncorrespondence between some categories dear\
    \ to the discipline and Bourdieu’s \nthinking tools (ADLER-NISSEN, 2013; BUEGER;\
    \ GRADINGR, 2015). Although \nit is wise to avoid equating the whole of practice\
    \ theory with Bourdieu’s \ntheorization, it is argued that, in the case of the\
    \ present work, the thinking tools \nmade available by his approach to practice\
    \ may help in situating the social struggles \nin the social universe around ‘cyber\
    \ security’. \nBourdieu’s practical reason is a product of his theoretical puzzle\
    \ of concepts. \nIt rests on the notion that the logic of practicality is not\
    \ that of the ‘logical’ logic \nnor that of rational calculation (BOURDIEU, 1998,\
    \ POULIOT, 2008). In this sense, \n“agents may engage in reasonable forms of behavior\
    \ without being rational; they \nmay engage in behaviors one can explain, as the\
    \ classical philosophers would say, \nwith the hypothesis of rationality, without\
    \ their behavior having reason as its \nprinciple” (BOURDIEU, 1998:75). Practices\
    \ are, in this sense, “self-organizing and \npropagating manifolds of activity”\
    \ (RECKWITZ, 2002).   \nThis approach distances itself from textual analysis in\
    \ that practical theorists \nsee little value in analyzing political discourses\
    \ and text internally, without further \nconsiderations of the wider social frame\
    \ within which they find themselves. Further, \nthe poststructuralist analysis\
    \ of “discourses as practices that constitutes the objects \nof which they speak”\
    \ (ADLER-NISSEN, 2013:6) contrasts with Bourdieu’s view \nof language as embedded\
    \ in social hierarchies and bodies, manifesting the agent’s \nposition in the\
    \ social world. This critique to pure textual analysis is enacted by \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n46 \nPouliot (2008), when he points that\
    \ some postmodernists distort the practical logic \nof discourses. \nPractice\
    \ theory is believed to contribute to explaining and understanding the \nactual\
    \ working of world politics. Reading social action according to socially \nmeaningful\
    \ patterns of action, performed more or less competently and \nsimultaneously\
    \ embodying, acting out and even reifying background knowledge \nand discourse\
    \ in and on the material world, instantiates an engagement with the \nrelationship\
    \ between agency and the social milieu (ADLER; POULIOT, 2011). \nIn this work,\
    \ discourse and practices are both important components of the \nanalysis on how\
    \ private companies act in the social world. As theory shows, in some \ncases,\
    \ practices are embodied in discourses (NEUMANN, 2002; ADLER; \nPOULIOT, 2011),\
    \ whilst in other cases, practices are legitimated or, conversely, \nobfuscated\
    \ by enacted words. Companies act primarily according to an economic \nlogic,\
    \ but other factors may as well instantiate the set of policies and dispositions\
    \ \nthey hold publicly, in their relations with other companies and with the government,\
    \ \nand internally. Having considering this, in the work, practices and the discourses\
    \ \nthey instantiate have been interchangeably investigated: marketing strategies\
    \ and \nproducts have been interrelated with press releases and with the broader\
    \ businesses \nin which the companies are involved, some of them quite secretive.\
    \ With this, the \naim is to show how, by offering and arguing for the advantage\
    \ and utility of a given \nsecurity solution – for example, “active defense” –\
    \ instead of another – for example, \n“passive defense” – and by a series of other\
    \ strategies that go from expanding its \nmarket shares by acquiring specialized\
    \ start-ups and contracting out with the \ngovernment, cyber security companies\
    \ contribute to shaping understandings of \nsecurity in cyberspace. \n2.6. \n\
    The sociology of Pierre Bourdieu and the importance of the \n‘thinking tools’.\
    \ \nIn the introduction of Réponses, Loïc Wacquant (BOURDIEU; \nWACQUANT, 1992)\
    \ argues that for Pierre Bourdieu the task of sociology is to \nbring into light\
    \ the ‘deep structures’ buried in the social worlds that constitute the \nsocial\
    \ universe, which is structured according to a first order objectivity and a \n\
    second order subjectivity. First order subjectivity refers to the distribution\
    \ of \nmaterial resources and to the means of appropriation of capital. Second\
    \ order \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n47 \nobjectivity is composed\
    \ by the mental and embodied schemes working as the \nsymbolic matrix of practical\
    \ activities and perceptions, sentiments and judgements \nof social agents. Bourdieu\
    \ (1990) himself points that the social world is composed \nby both symbolic systems,\
    \ language, myth, structures of perception and subjective \nelements of all kinds,\
    \ on the one hand, and objective structures “independent of the \nconsciousness\
    \ and desires of agents and (…) capable of guiding or constraining \ntheir practices\
    \ or their representations” (BOURDIEU, 1990:123), on the other hand.   \nBourdieu’s\
    \ sociology is one of the symbolic power. This notion entails a \nperception of\
    \ domination carried out by symbolic manipulation, which has become \npredominant\
    \ in Western societies, instead of forms of overt coercion and the threat \nof\
    \ physical violence. Symbolic systems, such as culture, science, religion or \n\
    language, are seen as instruments of domination (BOURDIEU; WACQUANT, \n1992; SWARTZ,\
    \ 1997). The belief in the naturalness of the affairs in a social champ \nis stimulated\
    \ by the involvement of the agent in it (and by his/her belief in the \nlegitimacy\
    \ of it) and includes both the dominant and the dominated. As Berling \n(2012)\
    \ notes, the champ exerts symbolic power on agents in subordinated positions,\
    \ \nonce they misrecognize their own positions and reproduce the hierarchies of\
    \ social \ndistinctions of the champ (see also SWARTZ, 1997). The right to monopolize\
    \ the \nsymbolic violence, or the power to define, is a stake in any champ.  \n\
    Social reality is both composed of objective structures and a product of \nrepresentation\
    \ (BOURDIEU, 1990; 2004; BOURDIEU;  WACQUANT, 1992). \nThis work is Bourdieu-inspired\
    \ in that it proposes using Bourdieu’s thinking tools \nto make sense of the practices\
    \ of private companies in the champ of cyber security. \nIt does not intend to\
    \ fully capture the theoretical complexity of his sociological \napproach nor\
    \ to exhaust the concepts through which the author chose to make sense \nof the\
    \ social world. The aim of this section is, otherwise, to show that thinking in\
    \ \nterms of champs and capitals is fruitful for understanding two phenomena,\
    \ the first \nof them corresponding to the dynamics of ‘marketization’ of security\
    \ presented in \nthe previous section. The use of Bourdieusian concepts is aimed\
    \ at reinforcing the \nrelevance of this particular term for apprehending the\
    \ enmeshment between public \nand private actors (following the line adopted by\
    \ LEANDER, 2014; BIGO, 2011b; \n2013; 2015). By focusing on the concepts champ\
    \ and capital, however, the work \ndoes not dismiss the relevance of the habitus,\
    \ which will be less directly addressed \nalong the section.    \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n48 \nThe second phenomenon that Bourdieusian concepts\
    \ make ‘readable’ is the \nexistence of struggles over ‘cyber security.’ This\
    \ chapter will present the theoretical \nsupport and introduction for the empirical\
    \ reading of the champ of cyber security \nand the practices of private companies\
    \ that the work will address. The present work \nregards cyber security as a smaller\
    \ field crosscutting with the broader champ of \nsecurity, and due to the former’s\
    \ particular dynamics and stakes, being relatively \nautonomous from the latter.\
    \ More specifically, by the end of the work, the reader \nshould perceive how\
    \ a Bourdieu-inspired reading allows taking cyber security as a \nchamp in which\
    \ private actors, among others, struggle for access to an expanding \ncyber security\
    \ ‘market’ and strive for influence using their services, advertisements \nand\
    \ discursive constructions based on ‘risks.’   \n The task of showing the helpfulness\
    \ of Bourdieusian sociology in thinking \nthe entanglement of state and market\
    \ actors and how it provides analytical power \nto make sense about distinct social\
    \ champs is supported by the ‘thinking tools’ \n(LEANDER, 2011:308) elaborated\
    \ by the author. These thinking tools are nothing \nbut those concepts through\
    \ which one comes to make sense about both the objective \nand subjective dynamics\
    \ of the social world. But they are, at the same time, a result \nof Bourdieu’s\
    \ concerns with practical questions that social science theory used to \noverlook.\
    \ As the author stresses, it is necessary to overcome the opposition between \n\
    objective structures and subjective representations in social science, a task\
    \ that falls \ninto his conceptual outline (BOURDIEU, 1998; see BOURDIEU; WACQUANT,\
    \ \n1992:71). Thus introduced, the broader aim of the sociological – albeit inspired\
    \ by \nphilosophical and anthropological accounts – approach of Pierre Bourdieu\
    \ seems to \naim for a science capable of building social facts which are in themselves\
    \ total \n(BOURDIEU; WACQUANT, 1992).    \nAttempts to wed Bourdieu’s concepts\
    \ and IR are expanding (JACKSON, \n2008; MÉRAND, 2010; ADLER; POULIOT, 2011; BIGO,\
    \ 2011b; 2013, 2015; \nLEANDER, 2011; BERLING 2012; 2013; ADLER-NISSEN, 2013;\
    \ POULIOT; \nMÉRAND, 2013) covering a wide range of issues, from studies about\
    \ the champ of \nEuropean security and its policies of defense (BERLING, 2012;\
    \ MÉRAND, 2010), \nto private companies (LEANDER, 2005) and practices of border\
    \ control (BIGO, \n2002; 2005). It has further inspired what is called the ‘practice\
    \ turn’ in IR \n(NEUMANN, 2002; ADLER; POULIOT, 2011; ADLER-NISSEN, 2013; \nPOULIOT;\
    \ MÉRAND, 2013).  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n49 \nThis inclination\
    \ for Bourdieu in IR is in part due to the fact that his theory has \nbeen seen\
    \ as a source of useful tools for thinking world politics out of the ‘black \n\
    box’ of mainstream IR theory, which includes conceptions about the domestic and\
    \ \nthe international as well as views about the state (POULIOT; MÉRAND, 2013).\
    \ In \nhis work Bourdieu is strongly critical of ascribing agency to the state.\
    \ His critique \ngoes far beyond conceiving the state as some entity that can\
    \ ‘act,’ once his main \nworry is to avoid being trapped within the logic of the\
    \ state – by validating its \nexistence without even questioning it – as the state\
    \ is nothing more than a well-\nfounded illusion that is validated through a consensus\
    \ (BOURDIEU, 2014).   \nIn addition, as set forth in the beginning of the chapter,\
    \ the disciplinary \ndebates that have challenged Realist objectivism and opened\
    \ up the field to the \ndialogue with other social sciences and the particular\
    \ influence of sociology in the \nformulation of critique – as evidenced by the\
    \ diffusion of constructivism as a \nmethod – were marked not only by challenges\
    \ to the existing theorization about the \nstate, but also by a reflexivity about\
    \ the researcher’s own role in producing theory \n– a topic that is constitutive\
    \ of Bourdieu’s sociology.    \nAs Adler-Nissen (2013) pinpoints, using Bourdieusian\
    \ theory in IR makes it \npossible to understand the constitution of lines of\
    \ inclusion/exclusion and the \nenactment of practices of assimilation and distinction\
    \ by social groups; it allows for \nanalyzing the power mechanisms at the disposition\
    \ of actors and observing the \nconstitution, usage and change of political ideas\
    \ through economic, cultural and \nsocial practices. In other words, its appeal\
    \ is to open up the possibility for analyzing \neveryday practices, symbolic structures\
    \ and arenas of conflict that brings distinct \nactors into perspective other\
    \ than nation states (ADLER-NISSEN, 2013). \nProponents of the adoption of Bourdieusian\
    \ approach in IR argue that it \nprovides useful tools for understanding the complexities\
    \ of international security as \nwell as a distinct reading of IR and of the constellation\
    \ of agents, champs and \ncapitals that inform current understandings of the international\
    \ (BIGO, 2011b; \nLEANDER, 2011; BERLING, 2012). Nevertheless, it does not come\
    \ without \nconcerns over how the concepts and theory have been addressed by IR\
    \ scholars. \nBerling (2012) notes, for example, that IR conceptualizations of\
    \ Bourdieu’s \nthinking tools have not taken the concept of capital systematically,\
    \ as an analytical \ndevice for understanding the international. She also notes\
    \ how scholars tend to favor \nindividual concepts instead of providing a “comprehensive\
    \ action framework” that \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n50 \n\
    could help setting the boundaries around a champ (BERLING, 2012:429). This \n\
    concern is also voiced by Pouliot and Mérand (2013:24). Similarly, Adler-Nissen\
    \ \n(2013) points the lack of a “general dialogue on the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ \nof importing Bourdieu into IR” (ADLER-NISSEN, 2013:1).   \nWhilst the present\
    \ work does not intend to resolve these critiques, it attempts \nto contribute\
    \ to the dialogue revolving Bourdieusian sociology in IR, and in what \nconcerns\
    \ security studies, most specifically, by employing the concepts of champ \nand\
    \ capital to understand the practices of private companies concerning cyber \n\
    security. In what Leander (2008) calls the “Field-Habitus-Practices” (FIHP) \n\
    approach, there is a visible tendency to not rely on all thinking tools in the\
    \ same \nway. This is not foreign to Berling’s (2012) work, for example. This\
    \ option for \nchoosing one, two or as many concepts as it is possible to work\
    \ with depends on \nthe ambitions, context and interests of the researchers (LEANDER,\
    \ 2008). Overall, \nthe Bourdieusian approach is interesting for IR and Critical\
    \ Security Studies in that \nit provides tools within which it is possible to\
    \ visualize shadowy power dynamics \nthat are often covered by the appearance\
    \ of common sense – in Bourdieu’s words, \nsymbolic power.  \nBy reading IR through\
    \ Bourdieu’s sociology, the most traditional object of \nanalysis in IR mainstream\
    \ and critical theories alike, the state, does not appear as \nthe main nor the\
    \ only actor in struggles over position (BIGO, 2013). In fact, the \nstate does\
    \ not figure as an actor at all, as it is taken to be a champ itself – a champ\
    \ \nof power, more specifically (POULIOT; MÉRAND, 2013). Bourdieu criticizes the\
    \ \nway the state is often pictured as a well-defined, delimited and unitary reality.\
    \ For \nhim, in fact, the state is an ensemble of bureaucratic and administrative\
    \ champs in \nwhich agents struggle over the power to rule a particular sphere\
    \ of practices. These \nagents themselves may belong to their own specific champs\
    \ (as is the case of the \npublic and the private sectors). In a sense, the state\
    \ works as a ‘meta’ champ which \nconcentrates different kinds of capital. The\
    \ construction of the state, thus, goes \nalong with the construction of the champ\
    \ of power (BOURDIEU; WACQUANT, \n1992).  \nBut what is, exactly, a champ and\
    \ how thinking in terms of champs influences \nhow one makes sense of IR and of\
    \ the social world? In Bourdieu and Wacquant’s \n(1992) terms, “um champ peut\
    \ être défini comme un réseau, ou une configuration \nde relations objectives\
    \ entre des positions” (BOURDIEU; WACQUANT 1992:72). \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n51 \nIn other words, the champ is a network which works\
    \ as a ‘structured space’ around \nwhich perceptions are built (BOURDIEU, 1988:784;\
    \ BOURDIEU, 2004). Simul-\ntaneously, it structures the habitus, understood as\
    \ the ‘feel for the game’ that \nrepresents a practical sense that structures\
    \ perceptions (BOURDIEU 1988; \nBOURDIEU; WACQUANT 1992; JACKSON 2008; BIGO 2011b).\
    \  \nFunctioning as a relatively autonomous social microcosmos in which \npositions\
    \ are defined according to the distribution of capital among agents, every \n\
    champ has its own set of inter-subjectively shared and taken for granted values,\
    \ or \ndoxa, which can be called into question in some occasions.15  \nServing\
    \ as a ‘vector of power’ (POULIOT; MÉRAND, 2013), the notion of \nchamp does not\
    \ work just as a social space of shared norms, but as something \nbisected by\
    \ conflict between distinct actors. Generally, binary oppositions, such as \n\
    the public/private one, structure the champ. As Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992) \n\
    indicate, the boundary of a champ depends on where the effects of this champ cease.\
    \ \nIn other words, it is specific to the dynamics of each case. To apply the\
    \ notion of \nchamp to IR makes it possible to move beyond the level-of-analysis\
    \ problem, as the \nlevel of analysis itself is always the champs – whether local,\
    \ international or \ntransnational – hierarchically organized within the social\
    \ space (POULIOT; \nMÉRAND 2013).  \nHowever, hierarchy in Bourdieusian terms\
    \ does not presuppose a static social \nworld. Instead, champs are essentially\
    \ dynamic. The visualization of the champ as \na space where agents act interestedly\
    \ helps to account for it as a site of power \nrelations permeated by struggles\
    \ over certain stakes. According to Bourdieu (1998; \n2004), incessant struggles\
    \ happen between actors within a champ (these actors \nbeing holders of specific\
    \ types of capital) to reinforce their own position in it, and \nto define what\
    \ functions as reality and its truths. Similarly, these struggles aim to \nreinforce\
    \ the strength of a given champ vis-à-vis others, “in order to increase the \n\
    value of their investment” (POULIOT; MÉRAND 2013:35). \nIn what concerns the limits\
    \ of the champ there remains a vagueness – “les \nlimites du champ se situent\
    \ au point où cessent les effets de champ” (BOURDIEU; \n                     \
    \                                      \n15 Berling (2012) calls “doxic battles”\
    \ the mobilization of different types of capital in a field in which \nthe doxa\
    \ has been called into question. The term expresses a situation in which changes\
    \ in the fun-\ndamental assumptions of a field are more abrupt and profound than\
    \ the case of the incremental \nchanges in which the doxa usually undergoes. \
    \ \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n52 \nWACQUANT, 1992:76) – that\
    \ obeys Bourdieu’s idea that the boundaries of a \nchamp cannot be defined but\
    \ by empirical research.  \nThere are as many champs as one can conceive. In the\
    \ course of his vast \ncareer, Bourdieu himself has dealt with numerous champs,\
    \ from the university \nchamp and the champ of intellectuals (BOURDIEU, 1990)\
    \ to the cultural \n(BOURDIEU, 1993) and scientific champ (BOURDIEU, 2004). In\
    \ IR, Bourdieu-\ninspired scholars have worked with the most distinct champs,\
    \ as is the case of the \nhumanitarian champ (LEANDER, 2008), the European security\
    \ champ \n(MÉRAND, 2010; BERLING, 2010), transnational champs of professionals\
    \ of \n(in)security (BIGO, 2011b; 2013) and IR itself (ASHLEY apud LEANDER, 2008).\
    \   \nThe universe of the cyber security champ, in the same fashion, is composed\
    \ \nby distinct actors not only from the public bureaucracies and the private\
    \ sector and \ntheir experts, but also from experts in the think tank champ as\
    \ well (see MEDVETZ, \n2012 on the champ of think tanks). Some actors transit\
    \ between the most distinct \nchamps. For example, public bureaucracies and private\
    \ actors are well known for \ntaking part in struggles in the champ of power (BOURDIEU;\
    \ WACQUANT, 1992; \nLEANDER, 2008). Last, but not least, the importance and the\
    \ part taken by the \nhacker community in this struggle can be glimpsed in the\
    \ impact that their practices \nhave for ordinary users’ cyber security, corporate\
    \ cyber security and states \nprerogative to secrecy, as is case of Anonymous\
    \ (DUNN CAVELTY; JAEGAR, \n2015). \nBourdieu uses the expression ‘game’ to make\
    \ sense of champ dynamics. This \nidea refers to the nature of the involvement\
    \ of agents in a champ, the investment in \nthe game which he terms illusio. The\
    \ notions of illusion and interest play the role \nof synonyms in Bourdieu’s lexicon,\
    \ despite the author’s later preference for the first \n(see BOURDIEU, 1990:48\
    \ and 87; BOURDIEU; WACQUANT, 1992:91). Each \nchamp has a specific form of illusio,\
    \ which also varies depending on the agents’ \nstructural position (how much capital\
    \ he/she disposes, for example) and trajectory \nin the champ (the agents’ habitus)16,\
    \ or system of predispositions acquired through \na relation within a given champ.\
    \ Interest and illusio express an idea of an investment \n                   \
    \                                        \n16 Bourdieu stresses that the notion\
    \ of habitus, contraposing that of Rational Actor Theory, aims to \nshow that\
    \ behavior is not necessarily the product of a conscious strategy or mechanical\
    \ \ndetermination. Agents “act” according to a practical sense, a social nature,\
    \ acquired through their \nhistoric of relations to the field. He argues that\
    \ agents “fall” into practices instead of freely choosing \nthem. (See: BOURDIEU,\
    \ 1990:90). \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n53 \nthat is opposed\
    \ to the very idea of indifference, once, in Bourdieu’s words, “l’illusio \n(…)\
    \ c’est le fait d’être investi, pris dans le jeu et par le jeu.” (BOURDIEU; \n\
    WACQUANT, 1992:93). This investment is, in a nutshell, both a condition of the\
    \ \nfunctioning of the champ and what makes agents get together, compete and struggle\
    \ \nwith each other. It is, furthermore, a product of the way in which the champ\
    \ func-\ntions (BOURDIEU, 1990).  \nThe relation between the champ and the capital\
    \ is one of dependence. In \nBourdieu’s words, “un capital n’existe et ne fonctionne\
    \ qu’en relation avec un \nchamp” (BOURDIEU; WACQUANT, 1992:77) and it may acquire\
    \ a variety of \nforms, the economic, the cultural and the social being the three\
    \ fundamental types \n(BOURDIEU; WACQUANT, 1992). It is the capital, this resource\
    \ in a specific \nchamp, that confers both a power over the champ and the conditions\
    \ to an agent to \nhave access to the profits at stake in it17. And, due to its\
    \ dependence on the champ, \nthe hierarchy between forms of capitals vary in relation\
    \ to the champ under analysis. \nIn that vein, the different kinds of capitals\
    \ held by agents in a champ influence their \nposition in it and, hence, the concept\
    \ of capital is relevant for establishing an agent’s \nposition within the champ.\
    \ The notion of capital is not one to be assimilated to the \neconomics conception\
    \ of it in terms of money or property, although both \nconceptions may crosscut\
    \ (LEANDER, 2008). \nBerling (2012) suggests that in IR “the concept of capital\
    \ can provide a \ndiscussion of points of access to a certain domain—a champ—for\
    \ different types of \nagency” (BERLING, 2012:455), once capital is important\
    \ in the selection of agency \nin a given champ, as well as in the establishment\
    \ of a boundary for participating in \nthe international domain. She thus argues\
    \ that a Bourdieusian approach to IR can \nprovide a multi-dimensional analysis\
    \ of power which can  \nturn the question of powerful agency into an empirical\
    \ analysis in which different \ntypes of field-specific capital serve not only\
    \ as power bases in the struggles in a field, \nbut also as points of entry to\
    \ the field for different types of actors. (BERLING, \n2012:464).  \nIssues of\
    \ power in the cyber security champ do not vertically emanate from \neither the\
    \ private actors or the government. What the concepts developed in \nBourdieu’s\
    \ sociology allow is visualizing the state, the champ of power, as the \n    \
    \                                                       \n17 In IR, the role of\
    \ capital remains underexplored. An exception is Berling’s (2012) work which \n\
    stresses its role as a condition of access to the field.   \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n54 \nprinciple of organization that serves as the basis\
    \ for dissent across the most varied \nchamps. As the author notes, it is necessary\
    \ first to have a consent regarding the \nground of disagreements and how these\
    \ disagreements are to be expressed \n(BOURDIEU, 2014). This allows for problematizing\
    \ the ‘state’ and visualizing \nwhat are the agents, either in the form of individuals\
    \ or organizations, that struggle \nin the champ.   \nThe practical outcome of\
    \ analyzing the social world through Bourdieusian \nthinking tools is that they\
    \ enable visualizing the relationality of power dynamics \nwithin society, where\
    \ power and domination are manifested through social \nstruggles and agents’ positions\
    \ in the champ. These struggles do not happen isolated \nin time and space, but\
    \ concurrently with other struggles in separated – though often \noverlapping\
    \ – champs. In the case of private actors, it makes it possible to avert the \n\
    neoliberal idea that their interest is purely economic and to see the politics\
    \ of their \ninvestment in a given champ. Social reality, in turn, hardly follows\
    \ the pernicious \nseparation between economics and politics present in economic\
    \ theory.  \nCurrent practices and competing understandings of cyber security\
    \ can thus be \nseen as resulting from competitions between agents about what\
    \ counts as insecurity. \nExamples are disagreements over important questions\
    \ such as: what kinds of \nphenomena constitute a cyber security risk and which\
    \ is/are the most urgent? Are \nviruses the most pernicious form of insecurity\
    \ or are vulnerabilities in networked \nsystems? When are hacking practices ‘lawful’?\
    \ Should ‘security’ be constituted a \ncore value in cyberspace?  \nThe resulting\
    \ practices and understandings are not restricted to what state \nactors say or\
    \ do to increase/decrease cyber security; they are also products of \ndistinct\
    \ forms of characterization and perception of threats by market actors, when \n\
    they advertise their products/services or attempt to provide technical assessment\
    \ \nover a perceived security issue. The most recent move in the antivirus industry,\
    \ for \nexample, has been to question the value and utility of this technology\
    \ in face of \nnetworked technologies and evolving security issues, such as the\
    \ case of zero-day \nvulnerabilities (DUNN, 2014; MCAFEE, 2015).    \nThe investment\
    \ in the cyber security champ is directly related to the stakes in \nit. Primarily,\
    \ at stake, it is the power to ‘define’ what cyber security is. The power \nto\
    \ name is constitutive of the symbolic dimension as it influences all the material\
    \ \ndimensions also at stake. The security/freedom dichotomy is a constitutive\
    \ part of \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n55 \nthis particular\
    \ struggle, as it is the security/privacy one, in which more security re-\nquires\
    \ less privacy (for the regular user). Influenced by this defining power, is the\
    \ \npossibility of having access to, profiting from or even expanding the lucrative\
    \ cyber \nsecurity market – which is not an exclusive interest of private companies,\
    \ but also \nof freelancer computer experts and hackers acting in the black market.\
    \ \nFor entering the cyber security champ, agents need a combination of two \n\
    resources: economic capital and technical expertise on ICT and computer security.\
    \ \nExpertise and technical knowledge of ICTs figure as the most relevant among\
    \ them \n– hackers, private companies and government bureaucracies are all imbued\
    \ with it. \nThis very specific form of knowledge is necessary for individuals\
    \ and groups to \n‘master’ the champ of computer security (HANSEN; NISSENBAUM,\
    \ 2009). Even \nin cases where technical expertise might, at first, seem to not\
    \ be involved, it is \nactually required, as it is the case of public policymaking\
    \ (NISSENBAUM, 2005). \nBut even if it grants access to the champ, technical skills\
    \ alone do not suffice to \nguarantee an agent’s position in the structure of\
    \ the champ. Just like in the economic \nchamp, the economic capital of the agent\
    \ is of great importance to assess its power.  \nGovernments and technology corporations\
    \ figure as powerful actors in the \ncyber security champ because in each case\
    \ there is a specific combination between \ntechnical expertise on ICTs and economic\
    \ power that represents both an improved \nability and availability of resources\
    \ to strengthen security standards and protocols \nand either develop or buy specific\
    \ goods, as it is the case of zero day vulnerabilities \n(see FIDLER, 2014). \
    \  \nBut there remains an important concept developed by Bourdieu that is \nextremely\
    \ useful for understanding the dynamics of the champ, which is the notion \nof\
    \ strategy. This is another concept that is actually relevant for understanding\
    \ how \nthings happen in a champ, the nature of agents’ practices and relations.\
    \ According \nto Swartz (1997) the notion is intrinsically related to that of\
    \ action and interest: \n“action as strategy conveys the idea that individual\
    \ practices are fundamentally \ninterested, that actors attempt to derive advantages\
    \ from situations” (SWARTZ, \n1997:67).    \nIn that vein, it is possible to read\
    \ some practices of private companies, such \nas the selling of their products,\
    \ the advertisements and their own discursive con-\nstructs – in the media, in\
    \ their own websites, blogs, by writing reports and even \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n56 \nhosting their own online magazines18 – as strategies\
    \ to expand their power in the \nchamp of cyber security. This notion of power\
    \ is strongly associated with the \nnumber of clients, as well as their nature\
    \ (governmental actors, other corporations, \nregular users, and so on) and, fundamentally,\
    \ the profits the company makes \nthrough its products/services. The expansion\
    \ of the market is thus a fundamental \nend that guides these practices and a\
    \ stake that is a particular result of the working \nof private interests in the\
    \ cyber security champ. A better and detailed account of \nhow these agents strategize\
    \ about cyber security will be provided ahead in the work.  \nTo summarize, a\
    \ Bourdieu-inspired reading of IR brings power dynamics to \nthe fore through\
    \ a link between social practices and discourses (LEANDER, 2008). \nBoth the concepts\
    \ of the champ and the capital are useful because they can guide \nthe research\
    \ towards uncovering the variety of relations, practices and perceptions \n(habitus)\
    \ that structure a given social reality, or, in Berling’s (2012) words, the \n\
    material and symbolic forms of power make up for struggles in a champ. In what\
    \ \nconcerns cyber security, it provides a reading of the practices of private\
    \ companies \nas strategies. These agents struggle and cooperate over distinct\
    \ ends: to guarantee a \ncontract with the government; or to contest attempts\
    \ to restrain their activity; to \nsurpass concurrence; to sell products and services\
    \ and so on. Often portrayed as \npartners and strategic actors in governmental\
    \ speeches to ‘secure’ cyberspace19 \nthese actors’ practices tend to be overlooked\
    \ or receive little attention when one \ncomes to make sense about who creates\
    \ cyber security/insecurity. \nOnce it becomes possible to deconstruct the notion\
    \ of the nation state and thus \nvisualize the practices of agents of the most\
    \ varied nature within a champ, the role \nof private companies in cyber security\
    \ and this very specific social universe can be \nproblematized. More than that,\
    \ these practices can be read under the lens of the \nphenomenon of marketization\
    \ of security, which suggests that the dynamics be-\ntween the public and the\
    \ private are more complex than the term privatization, a \n                 \

    3. Computers at risk: legitimizing the cyber security market \nThe current state\
    \ of affairs in cyber security is, in part, an outcome of the \nevolution of information\
    \ technologies and of the perceptions of its impacts on social \nlife. Sketching\
    \ the history of this set of technologies is an important step in \napprehending\
    \ the space of positions and position-taking in the cyber security \nchamp. Further,\
    \ it helps identifying the background knowledge that informs the \npractices of\
    \ agents in the struggle for cyber security.   \nThus, in order to understand\
    \ how struggles in the cyber security champ \nlegitimize the cyber security market,\
    \ this chapter will explore the historical \nevolution of information and communication\
    \ technologies (ICTs), paying attention \nto the information society thesis as\
    \ an attempt to make sense of the social impacts \nof these technologies. The\
    \ main argument is that these two phenomena, ICTs and \nthe perceptions of its\
    \ impacts on society, take part in the broader effort to legitimate \nthe cyber\
    \ security market. Both phenomena have contributed to fundament and \nboost some\
    \ of the existent regimes of justification about the importance of securing \n\
    existing networked technologies. The idea of an information age has been pervasive\
    \ \nin recent analysis about the influence of technological developments in society\
    \ \n(NEGROPONTE, 1995; KARATZOGIANNI, 2009; CASTELLS, 2010; \nSIMMONS, 2011) and\
    \ it has consequences for how securities and insecurities are \nunderstood.  \n\
    The development of computing technologies to their current stage and the \nexponential\
    \ growth in the number of people connected to the Internet are directly \ntied\
    \ to the privatization of cybernetic technologies in the 1980s (DUNN \nCAVELTY,\
    \ 2016). In turn, the strong presence of the market in the evolution of \nthese\
    \ technologies also influenced how to think and conceive the security issues \n\
    that arise because of them, hence the variety of actors addressing them as ‘risks’\
    \ \n(CSTB, 1991; PCCIP, 2000). \nThe first part of the chapter will explore the\
    \ pervasiveness of the information \nsociety thesis in sociological and IR thought.\
    \ The goal is to understand how these \nattempts to make sense of technological\
    \ changes have contributed to reshaping \nsecurity thinking. Next, the chapter\
    \ will trace the development of computing \ntechnologies in order to assess the\
    \ social context behind advances in ICTs. Our \nargument is that these technologies\
    \ flourished among public funding and the private \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n59 \ninitiative. Marketization allowed their exponential diffusion\
    \ to everyday life and \nhas informed the main security concerns underpinning\
    \ the information society \nthesis. The case of the Internet is somehow paradigmatic,\
    \ as it started as a public \nfunded research network and became marketable in\
    \ the 1990s. \nThen, the chapter will explore the marriage between securing Critical\
    \ \nInfrastructure Protection (CIP) and ICTs. CIP grounds many calls to ‘secure’\
    \ \ncyberspace and is central to cyber security. The debate incorporates the thesis\
    \ that \nICTs change the way security is understood. The notion of ‘threat’ as\
    \ something \nimminent, direct and very diffused is replaced by the notion of\
    \ ‘risk’, to make \nreference to the uncertain and future nature of most security\
    \ challenges of the \n‘information age’ (DUNN CAVELTY, 2009a). Risk-based thinking\
    \ is \ncharacterized by the confluence of different attitudes (providence, prevention\
    \ and \nprecaution) in face of the uncertain and it orients the practices of agents\
    \ in the \nchamp of cyber security, particularly in attempts to reduce the ‘inherent\
    \ \nvulnerabilities of cyberspace’.  \nThe marketization of ICTs can be read as\
    \ a strategic move that have altered \nthe dynamics and set important grounds\
    \ for the development of the cyber security \nchamp. The effort made in the chapter\
    \ aims to lay the groundwork for the analysis \nof the positions agents take in\

    \ understood as “vulnerabilities” and risk-based thinking \nrepresents an attitude\
    \ in face of the phenomena that remain ‘unknown’ to this \nmarket, as well as\
    \ the translation of risks to cyber (in)security, are useful for \nunraveling\
    \ the intricate dynamics of the cyber security champ, and they will further \n\
    allow the visualization of agents’ positions, the struggles among them and the\
    \ \nstrategies they use, to be set forth in the next chapter. \n3.1. \nThe information\
    \ society thesis  \nTechnological developments have been a source of fascination\
    \ not only for \npeople involved in their creation, but also for people concerned\
    \ with their impact \non society. Western societies have been rarely at ease with\
    \ the technological \nadvancements they often celebrate. New inventions tend to\
    \ be followed by concerns \nwith their impacts on everyday life and on broader\
    \ societal organization. And, most \noften than not, the ideas associated with\
    \ new inventions come to inform how their \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº\
    \ 1412452/CA\n60 \nimportance for every life is conceived. A computer with access\
    \ to the Internet can \nbe just that or it can be a revolutionary tool capable\
    \ of changing the most central \naspects of modern economy, culture and politics.\
    \  \nTerms such as “the global information age” (SIMMONS, 2011); “information\
    \ \nsociety” (WEBSTER, 1997); “information age” (ALBERTS; PAPP, 1997; DAY, \n\
    2001); “network society” (CASTELLS, 2010); and “information technology revo-\n\
    lution” (NYE, 2004; CASTELLS, 2010) are employed to make sense of \ntechnological\
    \ changes triggered by advances in micro-electronics and \ncommunication technologies.\
    \ Although it is possible to speak of information \nsociety ‘theses’, the use\
    \ of the term “information society thesis” in this chapter aims \nto provide a\
    \ common ground for all these conceptualizations as their core concerns \nconverge\
    \ to address the extension and impact of ICTs within society20.  \nThe information\
    \ revolution concerns the set of technologies subsumed under \nthe heading of\
    \ ICTs, characterized by the application of knowledge and information \nto knowledge\
    \ generation, information processing and communication devices and \nmarked by\
    \ a global reach integration between computer and telecommunication \ntechnologies,\
    \ with the use of information to overcome distance, time and location21 \n(DUNN\
    \ CAVELTY, 2002; 2007; CASTELLS, 2010). These technologies have \nallegedly benefited\
    \ networked (instead of centralized) forms of organization and \ncommunities where\
    \ information flows play a central role (NYE, 2004; CASTELLS, \n2010; SIMMONS,\
    \ 2011).  \nCastells’ (2010) version of the information society thesis22 is the\
    \ most \ndiffused, holding that ICTs are transformative technologies that alter\
    \ the conditions \nthrough which social and economic relations take place. These\
    \ technologies are as \n                                                     \
    \      \n20 Criticism to the information society thesis stresses the failure of\
    \ most accounts in setting out \nclearly in what ways and why is information becoming\
    \ so central to the point it ushers a new type \nof society. In the same vein,\
    \ it expresses a concern with the overdependence of quantitative measure-\nments\
    \ – or the question of how ‘more information’ is altering qualitative aspects\
    \ of societal life (see \nWEBSTER, 1997). \n21 For Castells (2010), it also includes\
    \ biology and artificial intelligence. \n22 Castells (2010) establishes a distinction\
    \ between the terms ‘information’ and ‘informational’ \nsocieties based on specific\
    \ forms of social organization. The idea of an information society \nemphasizes\
    \ the role of information within a given society and is not necessarily representative\
    \ of \nthe mode of organization of the current societies. Distinctly, the term\
    \ informational society indicates \na form of organization based on how new technological\
    \ conditions make possible for information \ngeneration, processing and transmission\
    \ to be sources of productivity and power. The author’s main \nconcern is with\
    \ the impacts of technology in the organization of society and it considers the\
    \ \n‘information economy’ as a transition in world’s industrial history (see also:\
    \ WIENER, 1989; \nROSZAK, 2005). \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    61 \ncentral to the information revolution as the steam engine, electricity, fossil\
    \ fuels and \neven nuclear power were to the previous, successive, industrial\
    \ revolutions. The \nnew paradigm is characterized by: having information as its\
    \ raw material; the per-\nvasiveness of its effects; applying the logic of the\
    \ network in any system or set of \nrelationships depending on ICTs; its flexibility;\
    \ and the indistinctness between its \nconstituent parts, due to the convergence\
    \ of their technological trajectory into a \nhighly integrated system.  \nThe\
    \ evolution of ICTs is marked by the deep integration between digital \ncomputers\
    \ and human living. The imbrication of software and ICTs in everyday life \ncomes\
    \ as a consequence of the growing interconnectedness and flexibility of digital\
    \ \ntechnologies and is what makes them so powerful. Computers can be programmed\
    \ \nto do a variety of things and so, they become pervasive and ubiquitous (HOVEN;\
    \ \nWECKERT, 2008; CASTELLS, 2010; KITCHIN; DODGE 2011). Disruptions in \nthe\
    \ normal functioning of objects and infrastructures dependent on these \ntechnologies\
    \ range from minor nuisances to major incidents with serious economic, \npolitical\
    \ effects and even life-threatening situations (KITCHIN; DODGE 2011). \nThe logic\
    \ of ubiquitous computing fed debates about a fourth industrial \nrevolution,\
    \ based on the integration of cyber-physical systems, on the Internet of \nThings\
    \ (IoT), big data, cloud computing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, artificial\
    \ \nintelligence and robotics (SCHWAB, 2015; EUROPEAN COMMISION, 2016). \nThe\
    \ information revolution would be the third revolution in history, preceded by\
    \ \nthe mechanization of production – the first revolution – and by the advent\
    \ of \nelectrical power – the second. The discourse does not change much: the\
    \ distinction \nof this revolution in relation to the previous one is because\
    \ of the greatest (and \ndisruptive. And unprecedented. Also exponential) speed,\
    \ scope and impact of \ntoday’s transformations (SCHWAB, 2015).  \nIn IR, strong\
    \ attention has been paid to the impacts of the ‘information \nrevolution’ – understood\
    \ more or less commonsensically as the society’s \nwidespread dependence on ICTs\
    \ and their growing importance to international \naffairs – on security (ERIKSSON;\
    \ GIACOMELLO, 2006; 2007). In fact, concerns \nwith technological change affecting\
    \ international security affairs are not new: they \nhave accompanied theorization\
    \ since the early 1900s, and have been particularly \nstrong during the Cold War’s\
    \ fears of a thermonuclear Armageddon (MCCARTHY, \n2015). But the technological\
    \ revolution has fostered in the discipline a whole new \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n62 \ncommonsense focused on a global interdependence\
    \ enabled by the transnationali-\nzation of production and by the development\
    \ and continuous spread of \ncommunication technologies since the 1970s (KEOHANE;\
    \ NYE, 1998; NYE, \n2004; MCCARTHY, 2015).  \nThe adoption of some core concerns\
    \ of the information society thesis by IR \nhas been partially influenced by a\
    \ growing dialogue with other disciplines, \nparticularly sociology. This dialogue\
    \ has resulted in a contestation of the \ndomestic/foreign divide, with a focus\
    \ on issues that either transcend or merge \ndomestic/foreign issues. Nevertheless,\
    \ IR has unevenly addressed the information \nsociety thesis per se and its core\
    \ focus has been on the impacts of technology on \nmatters of security, power\
    \ and global politics (see ERIKSSON; GIACOMELLO, \n2006; NYE, 2004).  \nMcCarthy\
    \ (2015) pays attention to the role of information technologies for \ntheory-making\
    \ in IR and argues for its centrality to the core concerns of the \ndiscipline\
    \ (for example, the changing nature of global governance and transnational \n\
    regulation; the transformation of the state; possibilities for democracy and concerns\
    \ \nabout hegemonic transition in the international system). This is an important\
    \ move \nto bring information technology to the core of IR debate – instead of\
    \ treating it as \nan exogenous phenomenon. Yet, whilst the author addresses some\
    \ core points of \nthe information society thesis, less attention is given to\
    \ the thesis itself.  \nWithin the discipline, theorization on technological change,\
    \ and particularly \non the social and political impact of ICTs, has been criticized\
    \ for being either too \ninstrumentalist or too essentialist (MCCARTHY, 2015).\
    \ In this vein, when a \ntechnological object is not judged by its use, without\
    \ major considerations of its \ncharacteristics, it is otherwise perceived to\
    \ “cause” social and political change \nthrough its inherent characteristics.\
    \ McCarthy (2015) argues that this deterministic \nbias precludes possibilities\
    \ of understanding ICTs as forms of social power.   \nState control, or the gradual\
    \ loss of thereof, over certain forms of power is an \nunderlying preoccupation\
    \ in IR considerations about ICTs (NYE; OWENS, 1996; \nNYE, 2004; SIMMONS, 2011;\
    \ MCCARTHY, 2015). A common assumption is \nthat the global information age, this\
    \ age where information is considered to be a \ncentral asset and resource (NYE;\
    \ OWENS, 1996; NYE, 2004; DUNN CAVELTY, \n2007; CASTELLS, 2010), casts doubt on\
    \ the traditional notion of power associated \nwith coercion and military weapons\
    \ and marks the increasing importance of non-\nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n63 \nstate actors, such as firms, interest organizations social\
    \ movements and transna-\ntional networks, in security politics (ERIKSSON; GIACOMELLO\
    \ 2007; DUNN \nCAVELTY, 2007). As Nye (2004) argues, the effects of ‘information’\
    \ on ‘power’ \ntakes foreign policy out of the exclusive control of governments:\
    \ \nWhat this means is that foreign policy will not be the sole province of governments.\
    \ \nBoth individuals and private organizations, here and abroad, will be empowered\
    \ to \nplay direct roles in world politics. The spread of information will mean\
    \ that power \nwill be more widely distributed and informal networks will undercut\
    \ the monopoly \nof traditional bureaucracy (NYE, 2004:82). \nDunn Cavelty (2007),\
    \ on the other hand, provides a distinct insight of this \nprocess of power redistribution\
    \ allegedly facilitated by ICTs and by the centrality \nof the information paradigm.\
    \ At the heart of her argument is the idea that \ncomplexity and change are two\
    \ distinctive characteristics of the information age. \nThey allow understanding\
    \ this historical moment as marked by persistent opposites \nin which order comes\
    \ from episodic patterns with contradictory outcomes. Thus, \ninstead of providing\
    \ some alarming or thrilled account of the ‘loss’ of state power, \nshe argues\
    \ that the outcome of the rearrangement perceived in the challenge to \nstate’s\
    \ position as the major player in economics and in the international system: \n\
    will likely be a skewed, complex and volatile pattern of power distribution, as\
    \ \ntransfer of authority occurs in diverse directions, and as changes are absorbed\
    \ and \noperationalized by different actors, at different levels, in different\
    \ ways and at \ndifferent speeds (DUNN CAVELTY, 2007:90) \nFrom a critical viewpoint,\
    \ the information society thesis captures the \ncentrality of information in Western\
    \ thought. The working of modern ICTs relies \non the production, storage, communication\
    \ and use of information. In addition, the \ndevelopment of the cybernetic science,\
    \ which anchors these technological \nadvances, granted information the privileged\
    \ status of an asset, or a valuable \nquantity, as information is considered the\
    \ central element of such scientific \napproach (ROSZAK, 2005; DAY, 2001). As\
    \ Day (2001) notes, the central place \ngranted to information in the ‘informational\
    \ age’ makes information both a \nsynonym for knowledge and an ‘economically valuable\
    \ thing’ (DAY, 2001:1).  \nConceiving information as a valuable asset has consequences\
    \ for thinking \nsecurity in the digital age23, as the integrity of information\
    \ becomes object of \n                                                       \
    \    \n23 Digital age security includes both the information infrastructure run\
    \ by ICTs and cyber threats, \nwhile the means of attack can either target physical\
    \ infrastructures underlying ICTs, such as tele-\ncommunication cables, or virtual,\
    \ targeting networked communications and systems (DUNN \nCAVELTY, 2007).  \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n64 \nprotection and the risk of losing\
    \ it is attributable to a perception of increased vul-\nnerability and loss of\
    \ control resulting from the move from an industrial to an \ninformation society\
    \ (ERIKSSON; GIACOMELLO, 2007). As such, it enhances \nsecurity policies’ focus\
    \ on the vulnerability of governmental and military digital \ninfrastructures,\
    \ on the one hand, and on the commercial providers that own and \noperate most\
    \ of these infrastructures, on the other, as well as the security \nrequirements\
    \ for their operation worldwide (PAPP; ALBERTS, 2000; DUNN \nCAVELTY; BRUNNER,\
    \ 2007).   \nDigital age security hinges on risk: from the inherent risk of system-failure\
    \ to \nthe risk of an attack by a third party. As information technologies spread\
    \ through \nthe social fabric, and the operation of everyday activities, from\
    \ communications to \nfinances, became dependent on them, vulnerabilities started\
    \ to be perceived as risks \nto security (CSTB, 1991). A particular feature of\
    \ computing technologies is that “a \ncomputer may be under attack for an indefinite\
    \ length of time without any \nnoticeable effects” (CSTB, 1991:15), which incurs\
    \ in the possibility of overlooking \nthe traces of attacks by mistaking them\
    \ for benign events or simply because they \nleave no clear traces. Computerization\
    \ presents security challenges stemming from \nthe nature of informational technologies,\
    \ which include the vulnerabilities derived \nfrom the programmability of computers,\
    \ the interconnection of systems and their \nuse as a part of complex systems\
    \ that comprise infrastructures dependent on \nsoftware (CSTB, 1991). The relation\
    \ between critical infrastructure and risk \ngrounds most of the appeals to secure\
    \ cyberspace and will be addressed later in the \nchapter. \nThe adoption of the\
    \ information society thesis by IR allowed visualizing \ncertain security challenges\
    \ associated to the pervasiveness of ICTs in society. \nTheoretical, policy-oriented\
    \ and even critical approaches to cyber security tend to \nincorporate these concerns,\
    \ in part or in their totality, in an almost naturalized way \n(ARQUILLA; RONFELDT,\
    \ 1993; DUNN CAVELTY, 2002; ERIKSSON; \nGIACOMELLO, 2007; LIBICKI, 2007; DEIBERT;\
    \ ROHOZINSKI, 2010), to the \npoint that some of the core assumptions of the information\
    \ society thesis can be \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n65 \n\
    read as a commonsense grounding cyber security24. The problem with this natural-\n\
    ized adoption of the information society thesis is that it also adopts a naturalized\
    \ \nview of technology in accordance to how it is described by some information\
    \ \nsociety theorists. In this context, a certain technological determinism has\
    \ prevailed. \nBut as the information age comes to be seen as the natural consequence\
    \ of \ntechnological developments, their impact on issues of justice, equity and\
    \ politics \nbecomes obfuscated (MAY, 2002). \nThe next section will dissect in\
    \ more detail the technological developments \nbehind the commonsense. Both the\
    \ development and diffusion of ICTs are closely \ntied with varying degrees of\
    \ processes of marketization, intensified with the 1970s \ncapitalist crisis and\
    \ involving distinct patterns of public and private enmeshment.  \nIt will approach\
    \ the development of ICTs and its social context, focusing on the \ninstitution\
    \ fostering them. Social fluidity between military, academic oriented \nresearch\
    \ and commercial practices contributed largely to the booming of ICTs and \nof\
    \ the Internet and such fluidity remains useful for comprehending the main \n\
    dynamics of the cyber security field.  \n3.2. \nMarketizing ICTs: the growth and\
    \ diffusion of information \ntechnologies from the 1970s to the present.   \n\
    \ The trajectory of the “development of ICTs” is quite difficult to approach,\
    \ \namong other reasons because of the lack of consensus regarding where one should\
    \ \nstart when talking about ICTs – or about what set of technological advances\
    \ \nadequately represents it. Contemporarily in IR and Political Science, the\
    \ term came \nto refer to the set of information-based digital technologies developed\
    \ in western \ncountries, as it is the case of the digital computer, of networks\
    \ such as the Internet, \nsmartphones and others. In some cases, however, the\
    \ interpretation is far more \nextensive so as to refer to any form of communication\
    \ technology, from signal fires \nto flags (PAPP et al., 1997). Even if one sets\
    \ its limits to the modern era, there is \nstill a wide range of technologies\
    \ falling into such category, as the case of the \ntelevision. For the purpose\
    \ of clarification, the section will approach technologies \nfalling into Papp\
    \ et.al. (1997) concept of the third information revolution. The focus \n    \
    \                                                       \n24 These assumptions\
    \ involve the information technology revolution and the alleged shifts in work,\
    \ \neconomy and production it generated, the centrality of information for the\
    \ organization of modern \nsocieties and the concurrent social impacts of these\
    \ tendencies.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n66 \nis particularly\
    \ on computing, which comprises machines and software, networked \nand telecommunication\
    \ technologies. Distinctly from Castells (2010), the present \nanalysis does not\
    \ include genetic engineering, although the interrelation between \ninformatics\
    \ and biology is a promising and very interesting trend in debates \nregarding\
    \ artificial intelligence. \n The history of the development of ICTs can be divided\
    \ in two moments: the \nfirst one concerns the development of micro-electronics25\
    \ and other machine-\nrelated technologies and the second one concerns the development\
    \ of networked \ntechnologies, among which the most successful example is the\
    \ Internet. There is no \nclear-cut temporal division between the two processes,\
    \ although the impact of the \nInternet was only felt in the early 1990s (NEGROPONTE,\
    \ 1995; CASTELLS, \n2001; 2010). ICTs are still developing and at a fast pace,\
    \ and it is a difficult task to \ncatch up to the most current trends in these\
    \ areas. Yet, at the end of the section, the \nwork pinpoints some recent developments\
    \ that are influencing cyber security \nthinking, as is the case of the IoT. \
    \ \n The World War II and its aftermath are the birthplaces of both the first\
    \ \nprogrammable computer and of micro-electronics, with the invention of the\
    \ \ntransistor26. Early computers were developed in Germany and in the United\
    \ \nKingdom, as war efforts to acquire technological superiority and defeat the\
    \ enemy. \nIn the US, also resulting from a war effort, the ENIAC computing system\
    \ was built \nto be faster than any previous concurrent. All these wartime machines\
    \ were \nenormous: ENIAC alone occupied more than 1,000 square feet and weighted\
    \ about \n30 tons. With their penetration into the civilian sphere by the 1960s,\
    \ the use of \ncomputers, albeit difficult, became more available. The development\
    \ of the \ntransistor, patented by Bell Labs in 1947, and further advances in\
    \ micro-electronics \nwould allow for a gradual diminishment of these machines.\
    \ \n  These advances were competition-driven, as a dispute in the electronics\
    \ \nmarket began to materialize and government contractors entered the race for\
    \ the \ncomputer age, as is the case of IBM in 1953, with its 701 vacuum tube\
    \ machine. \n                                                           \n25 Micro-electronics\
    \ refers to the subfield of electronics that studies and manufactures very small\
    \ \nelectronic designs and components. \n26 Transistors are semiconductor devices\
    \ that amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical \npower. They are fundamental\
    \ components of modern electronic devices, and are often embedded in \nintegrated\
    \ circuits.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n67 \nThe company\
    \ would later dominate the computer industry, populated by companies \nsuch as\
    \ Sperry, Honeywell, Burroughs and NCR. Except for IBM, none of these \ncompanies\
    \ lasted to the present (see PAPP et al., 1997; CASTELLS, 2010). \n \nCommercially,\
    \ the application of the transistor remained restricted until the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the junction transistor, in 1951. The later invention of the planar \nprocess27,\
    \ in 1959, by Fairchild Semiconductors, allowed integrating miniaturized \ncomponents\
    \ and precision manufacturing. The diffusion of micro-electronics in all \nmachines\
    \ came only in the 1970s, with the invention of the microprocessor28 by \nIntel.\
    \ The effects of miniaturization would spread to consumer’s everyday living: \n\
    (…) greater miniaturization, further specialization, and the decreasing price\
    \ of in-\ncreasingly powerful chips made it possible to place them in every machine\
    \ in our \neveryday life, from dishwashers and microwave ovens to automobiles,\
    \ whose \nelectronics, in the 1990s standard models, were already more valuable\
    \ than their \nsteel. (CASTELLS, 2010:41) \nFor Castells (2010), the 1970s represent\
    \ the core of information technology \nrevolution with the diffusion of ICTs.\
    \ The combination of “node” technologies, \nsuch as electronic switches and routers,\
    \ and new linkages or transmission \ntechnologies \nrevolutionized \ntelecommunications\
    \ \nand, \nadditionally, \nthe \ndevelopment of these technologies involved certain\
    \ degree of market competition \nbetween Bell Companies and Canada’s Northern\
    \ Telecom. But, as the author notes, \nit was the convergence of most electronic\
    \ technologies developed from the World \nWar II on into the field of interactive\
    \ communication that led to the development \nof the Internet.  \nJordan (1999)\
    \ suggests that the interest of US defense contractors in \ncomputers, as part\
    \ of defense research, forced the Department of Defense’s \nAdvanced Research\
    \ Project (ARPA) to give a significant step in the direction of the \nunification\
    \ of the use of computers in a single terminal by conceiving a project to \nnetwork\
    \ computers, what would be later known as ARPANET, or Internet’s \n“mother”. Castells\
    \ (2001; 2010) argues that the US government was motivated by \ngreat power competition\
    \ with the Soviet Union, and felt alarmed by the 1950s \n                    \
    \                                       \n27 The planar process is an advance\
    \ in the manufacturing of small components in the semiconductors \nindustry, as\
    \ it is used to build individual components of a transistor and to connect them\
    \ together. \nThis is the primary process by which integrated circuits are built.\
    \  \n28 Castells (2010) calls the microprocessor “a computer in a chip”. The device\
    \ incorporates the func-\ntion of a computer’s central process unit (CPU) by accepting\

    \ by surprise because “rather \nthan people using ARPANET to communicate with\
    \ computers, as the designers \nexpected, people used it to communicate with other\
    \ people” (JORDAN, 1999:38). \nBecause of this particular application, other networks\
    \ were developed. For \nexample, in the 1980s, the National Science Foundation\
    \ (NSF) became involved in \nthe creation of two distinct networks: CSNET, and,\
    \ in cooperation with IBM, a \nnetwork for non-science scholars called BITNET.\
    \ ARPANET was, however, the \nbackbone communication system of both networks.\
    \ What is nowadays known as \nthe Internet derives from this specific use of ARPANET\
    \ as the network of the \nnetworks – although ARPANET itself was closed in February\
    \ 1990.   \nThe Internet was “privatized” in 1995, with the extinction of the\
    \ existing \nNSFNET – NSF’s own network, developed still in 1984. Castells (2010)\
    \ suggests \nthat among the ‘forces’ that led to the closing of this last governmental\
    \ operated \nInternet backbone there were commercial pressures and the growth\
    \ of private cor-\nporate and non-profit cooperative networks. Since then, global\
    \ networks have \nexpanded enormously and significant shifts in the operation\
    \ of the Internet \noccurred. A current trend is that technology companies that\
    \ traditionally operate \nsoftware, like Google or Facebook, now design their\
    \ own hardware as a way to \nreduce costs and improve efficiency. Telecommunication\
    \ companies, like AT&T \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n69 \nand\
    \ Verizon, have signaled interest in pursuing this model, which will have \nimplications\
    \ for businesses of traditional hardware suppliers, like Cisco, Dell, HP \nand\
    \ IBM (METZ, 2016). The Internet's architecture today derives from the \ncompetition\
    \ among these companies. \nThis brief account of the development of ICTs tells\
    \ us something about the \nrelations and forces behind technological development.\
    \ As stressed by Castells \n(2010), scientific, institutional and personal networks\
    \ between the Defense \nDepartment, the National Science Foundation, major research\
    \ universities and \ntechnological think tanks were behind the development of\
    \ the Internet. The node of \nprivate companies should be added. Some companies\
    \ were behind think tanks such \nas ATT’s Bell Laboratories and Palo Alto Research\
    \ Corporation, which was funded \nby Xerox, and many others. Computer scientists\
    \ enjoyed great mobility between \nthese various institutions, creating a “networked\
    \ milieu of innovation which \ndynamics and goals became largely autonomous from\
    \ the specific purposes of \nmilitary strategy or supercomputing linkups” (CASTELLS,\
    \ 2010:48). \nThe Silicon Valley is perhaps the best example of market’s participation\
    \ in \nthe information revolution. In the 1970s, the site saw the development\
    \ of core \ntechnologies in micro-electronics29, thanks to the convergence between\
    \ a large pool \nof skilled engineers and computer scientists from the major universities\
    \ in the area; \nan assured market dependent on the generous funding of the Defense\
    \ Department \nand the development of an efficient network of venture capital\
    \ firms30. Besides, the \ndynamism of its industrial structure in relation to\
    \ the rigid, large and well-\nestablished companies in the East, allowed the diffusion\
    \ of new startup firms and \nknowledge diffusion through job hopping and spin\
    \ offs. Investors in venture capital \nfirms in Silicon Valley would also distinguish\
    \ themselves for being knowledgeable \nabout the projects in which they were investing\
    \ due to their origins in the electronic \nindustry (CASTELLS, 2010).  \nThis\
    \ conjunction of factors is, according to Castells (2010), also behind the \n\
    ease with which Silicon Valley was able to capture the industry of the Internet,\
    \ in \nthe occasion of its ‘privatization’: \n                               \
    \                            \n29 Examples are the integrated circuit, the microprocessor\
    \ and the microcomputer. \n30 Castells (2010) also notes the importance of the\
    \ early institutional leadership of Stanford Univer-\nsity.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n70 \nLeading Internet equipment companies (such as Cisco\
    \ Systems), computer \nnetworking companies (such as Sun Microsystems), software\
    \ companies (such as \nOracle), and Internet portals (such as Yahoo!) started\
    \ in Silicon Valley. Moreover, \nmost of the Internet start-ups that introduced\
    \ e-commerce, and revolutionized \nbusiness (such as Ebay), also clustered in\
    \ Silicon Valley. (CASTELLS, 2010:65) \nThus, defense spending, scientific research,\
    \ private companies and individual \nentrepreneurs were all driving forces behind\
    \ many of the emerging ICTs. The \nhistory of these technologies has been marked\
    \ by an interesting combination \nbetween public funding and private research,\
    \ both in academic and think tanks \nenvironments. In the case of the Internet,\
    \ even before its ‘privatization’, to use \nCastells’ term, establishing a distinction\
    \ between what was exactly government, \nuniversity and business (for instance,\
    \ a Boston firm named BBN was contracted to \nbuild ARPANET) soon became a difficult\
    \ task for those outside the booming \ntechnological environment. The naturalized\
    \ ‘job hopping’ practice between distinct \npublic/private institutional environments\
    \ also contributes to such perception.    \nThe commercialization of these technologies\
    \ is accountable for their all-\nembracing diffusion. In fact, as Castells (2010)\
    \ notes, technological innovation has \nbeen market-driven since the 1970s. In\
    \ a sense, the US has been the core of this \nburgeoning market. Some of today’s\
    \ biggest IT companies were born in the \ncountry, and, searching for new market\
    \ niches in products and processes, foreign \ncompanies often establish their\
    \ business there too. In addition, in the US, the state \nplayed an important\
    \ role in fostering such markets by funding and contracting out \nwith these companies\
    \ (CASTELLS, 2010).   \nBefore resuming this topic, a few words about current\
    \ trends in information \ntechnology are important, due to their impact on cyber\
    \ security thinking. Since the \ncommercialization of the Internet, in the early\
    \ 1990s, navigation and connectivity \nwere improved, and spread around the world.\
    \ The expansion and increased \nmarketization of the Internet are leading to the\
    \ gradated shift from IPv4 to IPv6 \nprotocols. In practice, this means that there\
    \ is need for more room online, since \ntoday’s Internet is so ‘overpopulated’\
    \ that the availability of IPv4 addresses has run \nout. Recent developments in\
    \ information technologies have contributed to this shift \nand one worth stressing\
    \ is the phenomenon of the IoT. \nAlso named industrial internet, Machine-to-Machine\
    \ communication (M2M) \nand ubiquitous computing, the IoT represents the most\
    \ recent trend of embedding \ncomputers in things (WEISER, 1999; EVANS, 2011;\
    \ KELLMEREIT; \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n71 \nOBODOVSKI,\
    \ 2013). The IoT is a network of coded objects, devices, vehicles, \nbuildings\
    \ and others, that collect and exchange data31 (see ITU, 2012). Put simply, \n\
    it is about machines ‘talking’ to other machines and providing data for Internet\
    \ \nbusinesses so they can act upon it (KELLMEREIT; OBODOVSKI, 2013). Modern \n\
    smartphones are representative of this trend, as are smart TVs, houses, cities\
    \ and all \nthe “smart” stuff. In this sense, “IoT describes a world where just\
    \ about anything \ncan be connected and communicate in a ‘smart mode’ by combining\
    \ simple data to \nproduce usable intelligence.” (BARAJAS, 2014). Sterling (2014),\
    \ on the other \nhand, criticizes this discourse for being a ‘slogan’ that disguises\
    \ what he terms “epic \nstruggle” over power, money and influence between some\
    \ of the information age \nbiggest companies. For him, the IoT is an “all-purpose\
    \ electronic automation \nthrough digital surveillance by wireless broadband”\
    \ (STERLING, 2014:5).  \nThe implications of ubiquitous computing for cyber security\
    \ are manifold. \nSurveillance (both governmental and for marketing purposes)\
    \ and third party ex-\nploitation are examples. Personal information and business\
    \ data existing in the \ncloud32 can be accessed/stolen due to exploitable vulnerabilities\
    \ in at least one of \nthe many devices that connect them. It suffices to have\
    \ one weak link in the security \nchain to be vulnerable to third party exploitation.\
    \ Thus, user privacy is a serious \nconcern in this interconnected world of things\
    \ (BARAJAS, 2014; GREENBERG; \nZETTER, 2015). And, of course, hackable digital\
    \ objects are not targeted only by \nmalicious hackers. They are also attractive\
    \ to government intelligence agencies \n(STERLING, 2014).  \nThe IoT debate represents\
    \ one of the most current trends in the development of \ninformation technologies.\
    \ The commercialization of the Internet in the 1990s and \nits global expansion\
    \ have been already pointed as directly related to the \nproliferation of security\
    \ vulnerabilities, particularly in what concerns the security \nof critical infrastructures\
    \ (PCCIP, 2000). Critical information infrastructure \nprotection has been portrayed\
    \ as a national security issue in the US and fundaments \n                   \
    \                                        \n31 The Cisco Internet Business Solutions\
    \ Group (IBSG) considers the IoT as the point in time when \nmore “things or objects”\
    \ were connected to the Internet than people. \n32 Cloud computing refers to the\
    \ possibility of accessing files and executing tasks through the Inter-\nnet.\
    \ By definition, it is an on-demand computing model of autonomous, networked IT\
    \ (hardware \nand/or software) resources. In practice, IT activities are outsourced\
    \ to one or more third parties with \nrich pools of resources (HASSAN, 2011).\
    \ \n \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n72 \nmost of cyber securing\
    \ moves from both governments and the private sector. The \nnext section will\
    \ present some considerations about the relation between CIP and \nrisk-based\
    \ approaches to security. This is an important link that supported \ncyberspace\
    \ securing efforts and laid the groundwork for a burgeoning cyber \nsecurity market.\
    \  \n3.3. \nCritical infrastructure protection, risk and public-private \npartnerships\
    \ \nThe CIP debate has been, for some time, associated to threats coming from\
    \ \nand because of cyberspace (ABELE-WIGERT; DUNN, 2006; DUNN CAVELTY, \n2005,\
    \ 2009c; 2015; ARADAU, 2010; PCCIP, 2000; PALLUAULT, 2011). The \nconcept embraces\
    \ a wide range of sectors in the economy, industry and government, \nsuch as energy\
    \ and electricity, water supply, transportation, logistics and \ndistribution,\
    \ government services, emergency and rescue, as well as health services, \nbanking\
    \ and financal services and telecommunications and ICTs (DUNN \nCAVELTY, 2009,\
    \ 2015; GAO, 2016). What is central in CIP are the economical \nand national security\
    \ risks of having these infrastructures, in which modern \nsocieties are grounded,\
    \ incapacitated or even completely destructed (ABELE-\nWIGERT; DUNN, 2006, ARADAU,\
    \ 2010; PALLUAULT, 2011).   \nThe argument sustained hereafter is that CIP debate\
    \ has been marked by an \nurge to secure both physical and digital infrastructures.\
    \ Efforts to secure \ninfrastructures are anchored in the distinction proposed\
    \ by Deibert and Rohozinski \n(2010) between risks to cyberspace, which include\
    \ CIP, and risks through \ncyberspace, understood as risks that arise from cyberspace\
    \ but do not target \n(physical) infrastructures per se. This distinction is not\
    \ at odds with Denning’s \n(2003) argument that cyber security should be viewed\
    \ as an infrastructure in itself, \nif one accepts that digital infrastructure\
    \ can coexist with, but be independent from, \nthe physical ones. Attempts to\
    \ secure cyberspace tended to include both aspects of \ninfrastructures, once\
    \ cyberspace can become a force-multiplier if the possibility of \nrisks to cyberspace\
    \ and risks through cyberspace are combined33 (see DUNN \nCAVELTY, 2008). \n \
    \                                                          \n33 The section will\
    \ not delve into the debate concerning the distinction between CIP and Critical\
    \ \nInformation Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). The latter’s focus is on protecting\
    \ data and software \nresiding on computer systems that operate critical physical\
    \ infrastructures. The distinction has \nbecome prejudicial for understanding\
    \ how CIP has been conceptualized, once in the context of \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n73 \nIt is worth noting that the concern with the protection\
    \ of vital assets dated \nback to the World War II. But only in the 1970s and\
    \ 1980s national security experts \nturned their attention to the possibility\
    \ of infrastructure discontinuity due to disrup-\ntions or third party attack\
    \ (DUNN CAVELTY, 2007; 2009; COLLIER; LAKOFF, \n2008). In the 1990s, developments\
    \ in information technology and the attention of \npolicy-makers and security\
    \ experts gave a new impetus to CIP in security debate, \nwith a focus on cyber-infrastructures34\
    \ (DUNN CAVELTY, 2008; 2015).  \nThis focus was an answer to a growing concern\
    \ with the interdependency \ncreated by information technologies that the US government\
    \ had developed in the \n1980s. According to the President’s Commission on CIP\
    \ report (PCCIP, 2000), the \ninterlinkage between connected infrastructures has\
    \ created a new dimension of \nvulnerability, that combined with the emerging\
    \ constellation of non-traditional \nthreats, was believed to pose “unprecedented\
    \ risk” (PCCIP, 2000:225). \nInformation infrastructure has, thus, been a core\
    \ aspect in CIP debate. Still in \nthe 1990s, it was established in security and\
    \ political circles that key sectors of \nmodern society increasingly relied on\
    \ a spectrum of interdependent software based \ncontrol systems for their continuous\
    \ operation (ABELE-WIGERT; DUNN, 2006). \nToday, ICTs have emerged as a common\
    \ factor upon which distinct sectors of \nsociety converge and the topics of cyber\
    \ security and CIP are often handled as one \nthing only (DENARDIS, 2014; DUNN\
    \ CAVELTY, 2015). Vulnerabilities in \ncritical infrastructures are attributed\
    \ to the centrality of information infrastructure \nin the operation and functioning\
    \ of core assets and infrastructures (DUNN \nCAVELTY, 2009).   \nVulnerability\
    \ is portrayed as an inherent feature of information \ninfrastructures, due to\
    \ not only third party exploitation, but also risks of internal \n           \
    \                                                \ncritical infrastructure policy\
    \ debate, physical infrastructures have grown strongly dependent on \ninformation\
    \ technologies. However, there have debates on the nature of cyber security as\
    \ an infra-\nstructure in itself. Denning (2003) advocates for this perspective.\
    \ This view, however, tends to \nexclude aspects of information security that\
    \ deal with information that is not digitalized. Yet, on the \ndistinction between\
    \ CIP and CIIP, Dunn Cavelty (2005) suggests that both should not be viewed as\
    \ \nseparate concepts, but instead, CIIP should be viewed as an essential part\
    \ of CIP. In this sense, a \nfocus on cyber threats would risk ignoring important\
    \ physical threats, which would be as dangerous \nas neglecting the virtual dimension\
    \ of the problem. \n34 The notion of cyber-infrastructure is anchored on interdependency.\
    \ According to Deibert and \nRohozinski (2010), through cyberspace, electronic\
    \ clearances take place, irrigation systems are \ncontrolled, hospitals and educational\
    \ systems interconnect, and governments and private industries \nof all types\
    \ function. For CIP, this implies that critical infrastructures do not need to\
    \ be attacked \nphysically, but may be targeted through electronic or virtual\
    \ means.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n74 \nfailure (PALLUAULT,\
    \ 2011). The President’s Commission report emphasizes how \nvulnerability constitutes\
    \ a security problem in more than a single occasion (PCCIP, \n2000:225, 228-229,\
    \ 233). Collier and Lakoff (2008) argue that CIP is based on an \nunderstanding\
    \ of security threats as system-vulnerability. This setting derives from \na perception\
    \ that 20th century’s technological and political developments rendered \nexisting\
    \ security frameworks inadequate, which has led experts to invent new ways \n\
    of identifying and dealing with emerging security threats, such as environmental\
    \ \ncatastrophes, major techonological accidents and terrorist attacks. One salient\
    \ \ncharacteristic of these new threats is their incalculability and, thus, the\
    \ impossibility \nof deterring them on the basis of the previous Cold War doctrine\
    \ of deterrence35.  \nA reading of vulnerabilities in terms of risk allowed experts\
    \ to embrace the \nelements of unpredictability and uncertainty that has served\
    \ to distinguish these new \nfrom previous, traditional, security threats, anchored\
    \ on the notion of “threat” as \nsomething imminent, direct and certain (DUNN\
    \ CAVELTY, 2009). Equally \nimportant, the idea of vulnerability sheds light on\
    \ the possibility of internal failures \nin society (PAULLUAULT, 2011). Thence,\
    \ the argument about risks to critical \ninfrastructures is anchored on technical\
    \ developments in information technologies: \nas new technologies rise, so do\
    \ new vulnerabilities (ANDERSON, 1996).  \nBy portraying vulnerabilities in information\
    \ technologies as risks, security \nexperts, policy makers and private corporations36\
    \ can offer distinct political \npossibilities and security measures to deal with\
    \ these informational society \nchallenges. The move has an important political\
    \ implication: the appeal to the \nnecessity of establishing partnerships between\
    \ governments and private companies \nhas been considered a logical imperative\
    \ in order to deal with insecurities in digital \ninfrastructures (ANDERSON, 1996;\
    \ DUNN CAVELTY; SUTER, 2009; PCCIP, \n2000). Critical infrastructures are owned,\
    \ operated and supplied largely by private \n                                \
    \                           \n35 Early CIP debates focused on catastrophic disruptions\
    \ in critical infrastructures, much like early \ncyber security debates focused\
    \ on cyber war. Aradau (2010) criticizes that the securitizing move \nfocuses\
    \ on an all-hazards perspective to CIP follows the risk-based approach to security\
    \ that is more \nconcerned with the unpredictable and unexpected failure and ignores\
    \ ordinary, everyday failures \nand disruption.  \n36 The participation of private\
    \ corporations can be both direct or quite subtle, as the case of the CSTB \n\
    (1991) report. The board was then composed by distinguished members from the academy,\
    \ computer \nscientists and representatives from private companies and think tanks,\
    \ such as AT&T’s Bell \nLaboratories and Xerox Corporation.   \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n75 \nactors who, collectively, have more sophisticated\
    \ technical resources and a better \noperational access to them than governments\
    \ (DUNN CAVELTY, 2007).  \nThe main political implication of the appeal to PPPs\
    \ to secure the digital age \n– which has grown strong in the CIP debate during\
    \ the 1990s –  is placing a great \npart of the burden of “securing” it in the\
    \ hands of the private sector. As Petersen \n(2008a) notes in her study of terrorism\
    \ and insurance companies, the concept of \npartnership allows giving political\
    \ importance to private entities by making private \ndecisions on “how to act”\
    \ a matter of national security. This process is very similar \nto the one inscribed\
    \ in CIP and cyber security debate. Thus, the process of policy-\nmaking is also\
    \ affected by the growing importance of PPPs: it is shifting from a \n“single-entity\
    \ phenomenon to a multi-entity one, as it has become customary to \ninvolve representatives\
    \ of all major stakeholders in the policy preparation process \n(DUNN CAVELTY,\
    \ 2007:103). \n3.4. \nRisk-based thinking and cyber security \nRisk-based thinking\
    \ has become almost indissociate from cyber security. The \nway threats are framed\
    \ as “risks” has become constitutive of the habitus of the \nagents in the champ.\
    \ Speeches, reports and documents of any kind tend to stress the \nrisk that vulnerabilities\
    \ in networks represent to the user, the corporation and the \ngovernment. The\
    \ same goes for the products and services being advertised against \nthird parties,\
    \ government or criminal, willing to exploit these vulnerabilities. Being \nconnected\
    \ is both a source of constant opportunities and dangers. \nThe task becomes one\
    \ of identifying over which perception of risk the \ncommonsense of the cyber\
    \ security champ rests. There are several approaches to \nthe notion, many of\
    \ which explicitly carry distinct interpretations about the social \nfunction\
    \ and meaning of ‘risk’, as well as about its relation to other ideas, such as\
    \ \ndanger or security. And the interplay between the latter and risk constitutes\
    \ an \nimportant aspect of many sociological and economic risk studies (LUHMANN,\
    \ \n1993; PETERSEN, 2008a, 2008b, 2011). \nHistorically, risk and security were\
    \ believed to express distinct ontologies \n(PETERSEN, 2008a; 2008b; 2011). Risk\
    \ followed a domestic economic logic, \nfunctioning within a universe of self-governing,\
    \ control and calculability. It “came \nto order our understanding of the possible\
    \ societal futures inside the State by \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    76 \ndescribing how people lives are organized and how decisions are made \n(PETERSEN\
    \ 2008b:407; see; LUHMANN 1993). Security, on the other side, was \nfounded in\
    \ the Westphalian political state and it has been associated with external \n\
    affairs. The relationship between private persons, firms and security was one\
    \ of \n‘protection’ and security was a right to protection. This conception of\
    \ security and \nnational security gives private persons and firms a secondary\
    \ role in terms of \ncarrying out foreign policies on security (PETERSEN, 2008b).\
    \ \nThe intersection between risk and security owes much to the rise of a common\
    \ \nresearch agenda highlighted by a focus on ‘new’ transnational threats, that\
    \ \nquestions the possibility of calculation and the means-end rationality that\
    \ were \ncentral for a previous concept of risk (PETERSEN, 2008a; 2011). Yet,\
    \ the debate \ngained a distinct form, as risk came to refer to a wide range of\
    \ everyday situations \ninvolving diverse themes and is subject to regulation\
    \ by governments, companies \nand citizens (PETERSEN, 2011).  \nThe diversity\
    \ of conceptualizations around risk can be challenging and \npossibly lead to\
    \ confusion. Petersen (2011), for example, identifies three \napproaches to risk:\
    \ an economic approach, a cultural approach and a sociological \napproach. The\
    \ first one considers risk a measurable and controllable analytical tool \nfor\
    \ capturing future threats; the second approach considers risks to be a matter\
    \ of \ncultural perception and focuses on the institutional and social structures\
    \ that shape \nperceptions of risk; the third approach sees risk as an ever-changing\
    \ discursive \nconstruction.  \nIt is intuitive to cast away assumptions that\
    \ consider risk as a coherent \nperspective. As Petersen (2011) and O’Zinn (2008)\
    \ suggest, risk studies compose \nmore likely a pluralistic debate, sometimes\
    \ with very few points in common \nbetween the existent perspectives. There is\
    \ no consensus over whether risk is \ncalculable or incalculable or even if it\
    \ is an analytical or descriptive concept. \nCritical risk studies, for example,\
    \ focus on the role of risk management decisions \nand security policies in establishing\
    \ meanings of politics and political power. This \napproach to risk inside IR\
    \ security studies understands that a risk based perspective \nto security offers\
    \ qualitative distinctions in terms of policy prescriptions and \ngovernmental\
    \ technologies, in relation to a threat-based one. Risk based \ninterpretations\
    \ are believed to emphasize more the systemic characteristics, such as \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n77 \nvulnerabilities, and less agency\
    \ and intent between conflicting parties (ARADAU \net al., 2008; ARADAU; 2010).\
    \    \nA guiding light in this labyrith of approaches to risk is to understand\
    \ how it \nis conceived in face of the uncertain. Ewald’s (2002) study on the\
    \ philosophy of \nprecaution is helpful in this sense, in that it highlights the\
    \ tensions between the \nnotions of risk and uncertainty in the context of a new,\
    \ nameless, paradigm of \nsecurity anchored on the notion of precaution. The author\
    \ presents the divergences \nbetween the economic assumption of risk as a ‘measurable\
    \ uncertainty’ and the \nprinciple of precaution by placing precaution in the\
    \ category of ‘nonrisk.’ A nonrisk \nis not measurable nor assessable. It is a\
    \ ‘risk beyond risk’ (EWALD, 2002:294). In \nhis terms, precaution is not prevention,\
    \ it is not applicable to what can be assessable; \nits focus is on what is uncertain.\
    \  \nCyber security is in the middle of the tension between risk and uncertainty,\
    \ \namidst the confusion between providence, prevention and precaution. These\
    \ are \nthree, complementary, attitudes towards uncertainty. Providence is based\
    \ on faith, \nprevention concerns reducing risks and precaution focuses on uncertainty,\
    \ the un-\ncertainty of scientific knowledge (EWALD, 2002). Exponents of critical\
    \ risk \nstudies contend, in consonance with the principle of prevention, that\
    \ “risk” may \nindicate a specific relation to the future, one that requires monitoring\
    \ it in order to \ncalculate what it can offer in order to control and minimize\
    \ its potential harmful \neffects or, in other words, “risk can be conceptualized\
    \ as an estimation of the \ndangerousness of the future” (ARADAU et al., 2008:148).\
    \  \nVulnerabilities in software and hardware are managed in terms of risk and,\
    \ \nfor the cyber security industry (to a certain extent), one thing is certain:\
    \ it is not a \nmatter of ‘if’ a device or network will be attacked anymore, but\
    \ a matter of ‘when.’ \n(RAYTHEON, 2015a; MARGETTA, 2014). The appearance of certainty\
    \ towards \nthe pervasiveness of ‘cyber risks’ in fact conceals the unknown identity\
    \ of the \nperpetrator and is at the heart of the ‘attribution problem’37. The\
    \ intensity of cyber-\nattacks creates the perception that attacks are imminent,\
    \ and that such events are \nonly a matter of time.  \n                      \
    \                                     \n37 The attribution problem refers to difficulty\
    \ of finding the true identity of a cyber-attacker. For a \ndetailed discussion\
    \ on the problem of attribution, see Rid and Buchanan (2015). \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n78 \nBut even if the language of risk seems to be predominant,\
    \ the principle of \nprecaution is part of many practices towards cyber security,\
    \ particularly considering \nthe existent concerns about the possibilities of\
    \ critical infrastructure catastrophic \ndisruption and cyber-terrorism (DUNN\
    \ CAVELTY, 2009). Ewald argues that “the \nprecautionary principle invites one\
    \ to anticipate what one does not yet know, to take \ninto account doubtful hypotheses\
    \ and simple suspicions. It invites one to take the \nmost far-fetched forecasts\
    \ seriously, predictions by prophets, whether true or false.” \n(EWALD, 2002:288).\
    \ Anticipating the unknown may be as tempting as anticipating \nmost tangible\
    \ possibilities. When considering this, one can imagine all the existing \npredictions\
    \ for cyber wars.  \nThe set of preventive and precautionary attitutes towards\
    \ the uncertain are \nindissociated from a preemptive posture towards security.\
    \ This is an attitude \ntowards security threats that conceives them as largely\
    \ unpredictable and \npotentially catastrophic and acts based on conjectural knowledge:\
    \ hunches, leads \nand suspicion. Preemptive security is not as interested in\
    \ seeing the action of \nindividuals as it is in premeditating potential dangers\
    \ (DEGOEDE, 2014).  \nCyber ‘risks’ are framed according to the uncertainty they\
    \ represent. The \nmore certain the threat, the more manageable it becomes. And\
    \ vice-versa: the bigger \nthe uncertainty, the more focused on anticipating it\
    \ the practices towards it become. \nThis complex modus of framing threats is\
    \ particularly stronger in the market where \nprivate companies act, as risk-based\
    \ thinking informs many of their practices. This \nis, again, the case of companies\
    \ working with “active-defense”, which are an object \nof this study. The very\
    \ notion of active defense rests on the imperative of becoming \nresilient in\
    \ face of the possibility of innumerous threats and, at the same time, using \n\
    the technical knowledge available to prevent a potential attack from happening.\
    \ It \ninvolves prevention on a large scale, and also precaution, in face of the\
    \ remote \npossibility of an escalation of cyber conflicts.    \nRisk-based thinking\
    \ is part of the background knowledge collectively shared \nin the cyber security\
    \ champ. It is grounded on some fundamental assumptions of \nthe information society\
    \ thesis, particularly on the implications of the pervasiveness \nof networks\
    \ in the current organization of society. The realization that attacks to \ninfrastructure\
    \ can have a networked effect, thanks to the code responsible for its \nundisrupted\
    \ functioning, has led to threat characterizations of cyberspace as \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n79 \nungovernable, unknowable and a source\
    \ of vulnerabilities and threatening actors \n(BARNARD-WILLS; ASHENDEN, 2012)\
    \ \nNow, these characterizations indicate specific views of cyber security that\
    \ are \neither reinforced or weakened once compared to the actual practices in\
    \ the champ. \nAny endorsing or rejection of a given characterization of a cyber-threat\
    \ must \nconsider the underlying struggles over the meaning of cyber security,\
    \ broadly \nspeaking, and the practices of the actors concerned. Having considered\
    \ this, the next \nchapter will explore the dynamics of the cyber security champ,\
    \ identifying the \nagents involved and the stakes over which they struggle. It\
    \ will pay a particular \nattention to the practices of cyber security companies\
    \ and their implications.  \n \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    \ \n4. (In) ‘securing’ cyberspace – the practice of cyber security \ncompanies\
    \ and the working of the cyber security market \nThe present chapter will investigate\
    \ the dynamics of the cyber security \nchamp. The central thesis is that the main\
    \ stakes involving private companies in the \nchamp of cyber security orbit around\
    \ their investment in a lucrative and diversified \ncyber security market, which\
    \ has been fed by attempts from politicians, the military \nand security experts,\
    \ to secure cyberspace. As argued in the previous chapters, the \npeculiar marriage\
    \ between information technologies and the private sector \ncontributed to placing\
    \ cyber security in a distinct position in relation to other \n‘threats’ to national\
    \ security. The same marriage informs much of the dynamics of \nthe champ, particularly\
    \ the struggles between the government and the private sector.  \nTo catch a glimpse\
    \ of this relation, the chapter will be divided in two parts: \nthe first part\
    \ will situate the struggles in the cyber security champ in the United \nStates,\
    \ focusing on the points of agreement and disagreement between the agents \nconcerned.\
    \ The option for limiting the analysis to the U.S. has two justifications: \n\
    the first one is based on the dynamic of the cyber security market in the country,\
    \ \nwhich is diversified and highly problematic. In the U.S., not only have \n\
    developments in ICTs been central: the country also concentrates the most intense\
    \ \nefforts to secure and securitize cyberspace (DUNN CAVELTY, 2008).  The second\
    \ \nreason is a methodological one: expanding the analysis to other countries\
    \ would \nrequire a more detailed account of the cyber security market’s dynamics\
    \ in each \ncase, a requirement that, for reasons of time and resources, this\
    \ research would not \nmeet. Yet, despite focusing on a specific territorial location,\
    \ the research shows that \nthe practices of agents in this champ rebound beyond\
    \ the U.S.  \nDespite initial difficulties in investigating the dynamics of the\
    \ champ in the \nU.S. directly, access to classified documents highlighting them\
    \ has been made \npossible thanks to WikiLeaks’ disclosure of contracts of products\
    \ and services of \nsurveillance and cyber security services between the U.S.\
    \ government and private \ncompanies. \nThe second part of the chapter will investigate\
    \ the practices of cyber security \ncompanies – a category that includes both\
    \ traditional defense companies that turned\nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº\
    \ 1412452/CA\n81 \ntheir attention to cyber security and newer niches, composed\
    \ by IT companies of \nvaried sizes that sell cyber security solutions and surveillance\
    \ technologies. Paying \nattention to these practices is fundamental to understanding\
    \ some of the current \ndynamics of this market as a political consequence of\
    \ the form of cyberspace \nsecuritization that has prevailed in the political\
    \ and military circles in the U.S. The \nsection also analyzes the burgeoning\
    \ market of zero-day vulnerabilities and its \nimplications for security in cyberspace.\
    \  \nIn the analysis, the chapter identifies in the practices of cyber security\
    \ \ncompanies certain tendencies that correspond to the adoption of three different\
    \ (but \nsometimes complementary) approaches to cyber security. These approaches\
    \ \ncorrespond to the features and measures that are the most valued in each selected\
    \ \nproduct. They correspond to defensive security, openly offensive security\
    \ and \nactive defense. A distinction is made between openly offensive measures\
    \ and active \ndefense on the basis that the latter encompasses the former, but\
    \ the contrary does \nnot happen. In commercial cyber security, active defense\
    \ involves a vast range of \nsolutions among which offense is a silent possibility,\
    \ while in the companies’ \nrelations with governments, it is a tacit option.\
    \ \n4.1. \nStruggles in the cyber security champ in the U.S. \nAs Pierre Bourdieu\
    \ (1992, 2004) would note, the social world is constituted \nby struggles between\
    \ distinct agents over certain stakes. These struggles are \ncertainly marked\
    \ by patterns of cooperation and competition aiming for a certain \nform of power,\
    \ as is the case of the power to name some issue as something, and \nthey are\
    \ constitutive of the social champs that intersect with the field of power and\
    \ \ndwell in the social world. Based on this view of the social world, this section\
    \ will \nproceed into assessing the struggles in the champ. It will do so by mapping\
    \ agents’ \nposition vis-à-vis one another, based on the amount of capital each\
    \ disposes. The \nanalysis of the existing conflicts and alliances will, in turn,\
    \ provide an overview of \nthe current stakes in the champ. The data-gathering\
    \ process was based on the \nselection of official documents, advertisements,\
    \ market analyses, job offerings, \njournalistic texts, classified documents and\
    \ e-mails leaked in WikiLeaks, reports \nand webpages of companies offering cyber\
    \ security services, defense-related \ngovernment agencies and think tanks. The\
    \ identification of agents was based on \ntheir involvement in the idealization,\
    \ development, commercialization and \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    82 \ndiscursive justification of cyber security solutions. Each agent’s position\
    \ is assessed \nin terms of the technical and economic capital they dispose. \
    \ \nCyber security is a puzzle constituted by distinct actors, among public \n\
    bureaucracies, defense experts, computer experts and private companies, all of\
    \ \nwhich struggle for making sense about its core elements. It is shaped by discourses\
    \ \nand practices alike, and it often involves conflicting perceptions about the\
    \ referent \nobject being threatened. The following actors have been protagonists\
    \ in struggles \ninside the champ of cyber security in the US: government’s defense\
    \ and intelligence \nagencies; the hacking community, independent IT experts;\
    \ security experts working \nin policy-oriented think tanks, and private technology\
    \ companies38.  \nIn the champ, the existence of a burgeoning market for securing\
    \ computers \nand users (individuals, businesses and governments) is often accepted\
    \ as a natural \nconsequence of the recognition of cyberspace’s inherent insecurity,\
    \ to the point that \nthe champ and the market juxtapose. The main dynamics of\
    \ the champ involve, on \nthe one hand, the commercialization of cyber security\
    \ solutions, endpoint \nprotection, consulting services, cyber risk management,\
    \ and others, and, on the \nother hand, the construction of distinct representations\
    \ of cyber threats by private \ncompanies, government agencies and think tanks,\
    \ in order to gather resources to \nsupport activities that range from R&D to\
    \ outsourcing and funds for policy \nadvising.  \nGovernment agencies  \nIf the\
    \ defense and intelligence community’s activities seemed to be \nsmoldering since\
    \ the end of the Cold War, the combination between ‘big data’, \nsecurity threats\
    \ and terrorism has renewed the purpose of their activities \n(DEIBERT, 2013),\
    \ as well as added new players to the government bureaucracies’ \nstruggles. One\
    \ example is the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created in \n2002, after\
    \ the 11/09 terrorist attacks in the US. The DHS is formally charged with \ncivilian\
    \ security and is responsible for coordinating the efforts to protect US critical\
    \ \ninfrastructure from disruptions. Its approach to cyber security is similar\
    \ to the \n                                                           \n38 The\
    \ label embraces a wide range of sectors, from antivirus companies, to software\
    \ and hardware \ndevelopers, Internet service providers and online services providers.\

    \ perceptions, considering the vulnerability of cyberspace \nand its infrastructure\
    \ to physical and cyber threats or hazards (DHS, 2016).  \n Early struggles between\
    \ government’s defense and intelligence agencies \nconcern who would be in charge\
    \ of cyber security initiatives (SCHNEIER, 2009), \na function that today seems\
    \ to be shared among the FBI, the NSA, the DoD and the \nDHS at different levels.\
    \ These agencies enter the field provided with technical \nexpertise on information\
    \ technologies and risk management, which can come from \ninside employees or\
    \ in the form of defense contracts with private companies, \ncooperation with\
    \ other government agencies, partnerships with the private sector \nand networks\
    \ with policy and risk experts working for think tanks. The size of the \ncyber\
    \ security budget of each agency allows providing numerous jobs opportunities\
    \ \nand investments in highly technological projects inside the agency or in private\
    \ \ncontractors and is determinant in setting their position vis-à-vis one another\
    \ and in \nrelation to other agents in the champ. Despite limitations in workforce\
    \ and \nefficiency, the amount of economic and political capital they dispose\
    \ makes these \nagencies powerful actors struggling in the field. \nTable 1: Approximate\

    \ government. According to Shorrock \n(2008), in 2007, about 70% of this budget\
    \ went to outsourced activities. The ‘black budget’, as it is \nalso known, is\
    \ classified, but documents leaked by Edward Snowden showed that the agency was\
    \ in \nline to receive $10.5 billion in 2013.  \n40 According to the DHS, “cyber”\
    \ or cyber security jobs tend to deal with the following tasks: cyber \nincident\
    \ response, cyber risk and strategic analysis, vulnerability detection and assessment,\
    \ intelli-\ngence and investigation, networks and systems engineering, digital\
    \ forensics and forensics analysis \nand software assurance. It can also involve\
    \ intelligence gathering and SIGINT. \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    84 \nContestations often come in the form of questioning an agency’s capacity\
    \ to \nhandle cyber security initiatives and have resulted in the strengthening\
    \ of alliances \nbetween some governmental agencies. The DHS, for example, has\
    \ been criticized \nfor being too bureaucratic and technically incompetent by\
    \ industry and security \nexperts. The critique, in turn, led the department to\
    \ adopt a strategy of allying with \nother agencies, such as the Departments of\
    \ Commerce, Defense, Justice and State, \nin order to provide a coherent cyber\
    \ defense policy and to develop international \nstandards (GARCIA et al., 2014).\
    \ \nThe agencies also adopt competing understandings and practices of cyber \n\
    security. Operating at the level of defense, the DoD41 considers that disruptions\
    \ \nfrom third parties, state-owned and private, and cyber theft of intellectual\
    \ property \nto undercut US technological and military advantage constitute core\
    \ cyber security \nthreats to the security of national networks, systems and information\
    \ (DOD, 2016). \nThe most polemical – and secretive – agency in the government\
    \ bureaucratic milieu, \nthe NSA, does little to define cyber security, but invokes\
    \ the importance of \nincreasing vigilance and resources to thwart cyber risks\
    \ (ROGERS, 2015). The \nagency has built a huge and complex system of mass surveillance,\
    \ which \ndimensions came to the public due to leaks by Edward Snowden. The NSA’s\
    \ known \npractices involve using hacking and mass surveillance to provide intelligence\
    \ to the \nfederal government.  \nThe NSA’s practices find some resistance in\
    \ segments of the private sector, \nof the Department of Justice and the FBI,\
    \ particularly regarding its surveillance \nprogram and the possibility of being\
    \ charged of cyber security (SCHNEIER, 2009). \nThe agency recently announced\
    \ a reorganization that will consolidate its spying and \ndomestic cyber security\
    \ operations, thus unifying espionage and cyber defense \ncapabilities for the\
    \ US government (VOLZ, 2016). \nDespite resisting the idea of concentrating cyber\
    \ security in the hands of the \nNSA, the FBI has cooperated with the agency in\
    \ data gathering for intelligence \npurposes and it has, itself, focused on intelligence\
    \ attributions concurrently with its \ntraditional law enforcement duties (BARRET,\
    \ 2015; ACKERMAN, 2015; \nDEIBERT, 2013). This stronger orientation towards intelligence\
    \ activities, also \n                                                        \
    \   \n41 The DoD operates at the external defense level. It’s “cyber” mission,\
    \ to use the department’s own \nterminology, concerns the defense of networks,\
    \ systems and information against cyber-attacks and \nthe provision of “cyber”\
    \ support to military operational and contingency plans (DOD, 2016).  \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n85 \nanchored in the FBI’s interests in\
    \ cyber security for law enforcement against cyber-\ncrime, has placed the agency\
    \ on the forefront of some core information age security \ndebates. The encryption\
    \ debate is perhaps the most known of them42 and, in addition \nto placing the\
    \ FBI against some powerful technology corporations43, it highlights \nthe distinct\
    \ approaches to encryption inside the government apparatus44, opposing \nthe FBI’s\
    \ and the NSA’s public position over the matter (MCLAUGHLIN, 2016).  \nYet, in\
    \ face of the leaked documents provided by Edward Snowden, NSA’s \nstrategy does\
    \ not necessarily need to be read as a pro-privacy discourse. As the \nformer\
    \ NSA director Michael Hayden signaled, US intelligence agencies know how \nto\
    \ gather information without weakening encryption. He also left unsaid that \n\
    hacking allows both agencies to circumvent encryption to get content as well \n\
    (MCLAUGHLIN, 2016; HACKETT, 2016).  \nTable 3: Main points of agreement and disagreement\

    \ government agencies and private actors (DUNN CAVELTY, 2016; \nDOD, 2016; FBI,\
    \ 2016; DHS, 2016). These comprise a wide range of unlawful and \nillegal activities\
    \ online and practices dependent on a certain degree of knowledge \nof coding,\
    \ like sabotage and espionage. For example, the FBI definition of ‘high \ntechnology\
    \ crimes’ englobes cyber terrorism, espionage, computer intrusion and \nfraud.\

    perpetrated by an individual with enough expertise in computers: black markets45\
    \ \nhave become a profitable venue for sophisticated, highly organized and financially\

    \ and Lulzsec, differs substantially from profit hacking in \nthat it is carried\
    \ out of some political, religious, environmental or personal \nconviction (IDEM,\
    \ 2011). Hacktivists tend to use their knowledge of code to target \ngovernment\
    \ and global institutions’ websites (NYE, 2014).  \nHence, hackers are fundamental\
    \ players in the cyber security champ, but they \nare far from being a uniform\
    \ group. Some of them are profit oriented and dispose \nof some degree of institutional\
    \ organization and economic capital, as is the case of \nthe Hidden Linx group\
    \ (DOHERTY et al., 2013), while others work in disperse \nnetworks around the\
    \ world, with little economic capital or institutionalization and \nuse hacking\
    \ as a strategy to give visibility to certain political claims (NYE, 2014). \n\
    Their position varies in terms of the impact of their actions to other agents’\
    \ \nstrategies and they exert considerable influence in authoritative definitions\
    \ of cyber \nsecurity.  \nIndependent IT experts \n IT experts have a similar\
    \ knowledge of code and computers as hackers do, \nand they can be compared to\
    \ non-malicious hackers in most of their activities. They \nare different in that\
    \ they usually make a living of this knowledge, composing the \n‘cyber security\
    \ workforce’ in private companies, think tanks and the government. \nBut these\
    \ actors can transit among autonomous, lawful work and the black market, \nsometimes\
    \ overlapping with the figure of the malicious hacker. In the current cyber \n\
    threat scenario, this group can be really valuable: demand for IT professionals\
    \ has \nbeen rising for some time, both in the government and in the private sector,\
    \ as a \nresponse to the diffusion of computers and connectivity, the slow advance\
    \ in secure \nsoftware and the perception of insecurity arising from it and from\
    \ awareness of \nhacking activities (LIBICKI et al., 2014). Individuals with expertise\
    \ in IT can work \nindependently or as part of a public/private organization,\
    \ identifying vulnerabilities \nand advanced persistent threats (APTs) and either\
    \ reporting them to the company \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    88 \nthat develops the software or commercializing them in the gray market46 or\
    \ in the \nblack market (FIDLER, 2014; DOHERTY et.al., 2013).   \nAs hackers,\
    \ the core capital these agents possess is (a deep) knowledge of \ncoding. Knowledge\
    \ of market dynamics can be equally important – all the more if \nthe professional\
    \ works independently (FIDLER, 2014). Because of this valuable \n‘asset’, cyber\
    \ security professionals often find themselves in the middle of struggles \nbetween\
    \ government agencies and private companies for specialized workforce \n(LIBICKI\
    \ et al., 2014). Their knowledge of computer technology is, thus, an \nimportant\
    \ capital for these actors and each sector offers different incentives to \nattract\
    \ IT experts: the private market usually offers high salaries and flexible \n\
    benefits to attract professionals, but in turn grants less stability; the public\
    \ market \nhas less flexible wages and benefits. Yet, as Libicki et al. (2014)\
    \ argue, a \ngovernment employee has the privilege of carrying out certain operations\
    \ that \nwould be considered illegal if done by anyone else.  \nBecause of the\
    \ difficulties in hiring ‘upper tier’47 cyber security professionals, \nsome agencies\
    \ (e.g. the NSA) would rather ‘make’ than ‘buy’ professionals (by \n“making” the\
    \ work refers to investing in qualification after the recruitment). \nFurther,\
    \ a recent strategy of the US government to deal with the problem of \nrecruiting\
    \ skilled individuals has been to outsource the work to private contractors. \n\
    What happens to the provision of security is also applicable to the recruitment\
    \ of \nsecurity professionals: as governments are unable to adequately provide\
    \ it by \nthemselves, recruitment policies are predicated on the concept of sharing\
    \ \nresponsibility with private actors (DUNN CAVELTY, 2009b). \nSecurity experts\
    \ in policy-oriented think tanks \n On a distinct spectrum of the map lie policy-oriented\
    \ think tanks that have \nturned considerable attention to cyber security in the\

    \ tanks’ activities show the growing importance of the \nsubject for policy-making.\
    \ All the six most influential think tanks in the US48 have \npolicy topics and\
    \ experts working with cyber security policy-making and publica-\ntions have increased\
    \ considerably since 201049. Among them, the RAND \nCorporation has begun to address\
    \ information security still in the 1980s, having \nentered the ‘cyber’ realm\
    \ in the 1990s, with the well-known publication by Arquilla \nand Ronfeldt (1993)\
    \ named “Cyber war is coming!”.   \n Think tanks’ involvement in cyber security\
    \ comes as either a reaction to \nperceived vulnerabilities in computer security,\
    \ as it was the case of the RAND \nCorporation’s early involvement with the topic\
    \ (see WARE, 1966; 1967a; 1967b), \nor to the increasing prominence that cyber\
    \ security acquired in policy-making \nprocess (GARCIA et al., 2014; DUNN CAVELTY,\
    \ 2016). Policy-oriented think \ntanks tend to produce perceptions about cyber\
    \ threats and risks and revenues can \ninfluence the content-production in most\
    \ cases. Recurrent sources of income for \nmajor think tanks include self-generated\
    \ revenue, e.g., charging conferences and \nmembership fees and selling their\
    \ own books and periodicals, donations from \nfoundations, individuals and corporations,\
    \ and government grants and contracts.50 \nDonations diverge in their symbolic\
    \ effects: money from specific sectors of an \nindustry often comes with a specific\
    \ purpose, whilst donations from foundations \ncan focus on broader stakes. In\
    \ the case of cyber security, this may result in policy \nprescriptions focused\
    \ on thinking about how government actions affect the private \n             \
    \                                              \n48 The top 6 most influential\
    \ think tanks in the US are: Brookings Institution, The Carnegie \nEndowment for\
    \ International Peace, the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS),\
    \ the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations, the Wilson Center and the RAND Corporation.\

    \ Report. Available at: \n<http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=think_tanks>.\
    \  \n49 A quick search in each website reveals this growth: Brookings started\
    \ publishing about cyber \nsecurity in 2010 and today has about 283 publications,\
    \ among events, reports, commentaries, expert \nopinions and books. The RAND Corporation\
    \ has about 164 publications only under the topic of \ncyber security, and much\
    \ more under the topics of cyber warfare and information security. The CSIS \n\
    has offered the biggest search results, totalizing 324 publications under the\
    \ topic technology and \ncyber security. Both the RAND Corporation and the CSIS\
    \ have offered diversified accounts of \ncyber-issues, addressing cybercrime,\
    \ risk, cyberwarfare, surveillance and a broad range of topics \nconcerning the\
    \ impacts of ICTs on security. The Wilson Center and the Carnegie Endowment for\
    \ \nInternational Peace are those with the more modest search results: they account\
    \ for about 40 and 49 \npublications on the topic of cyber security, respectively.\
    \   \n50 Think tanks often depend on three kinds of clients: political clients,\
    \ e.g., policy-makers, parties \nand activist networks; economic clients, e.g.,\
    \ foundations, corporations and wealthy donors; and \nmedia clients, e.g., journalists,\
    \ newspapers, periodicals, radio and television programs. In most \ncases, economic\

    \ the broader landscape. Partnerships with governments, \nin turn, can grant think\
    \ tanks both political access and robust funding, but they are \nnot always desirable,\
    \ once there is a risk of undermining the perception of the in-\nstitution as\
    \ ‘independent’ (MEDVETZ, 2012). \n The attention directed at cyber security is\
    \ influenced by both think tanks’ \nrelations with economic and political actors\
    \ and struggles for publicity and funding. \nThe kind of relationship each think\
    \ tank has with its sponsor and the professional \nbackground of its experts also\
    \ influences the focus of its publications, as it is the \ncase of RAND’s attention\
    \ to cyber war and cyber threats51 and of CSIS’ debates on \nCIP, governance and\
    \ surveillance.52 Think tanks are particularly influential in \nproviding competing\
    \ definitions for cyber security and cyber threats/risks, \nsometimes in alignment\
    \ with governmental definitions and sometimes contesting \nthem (DUNN CAVELTY,\
    \ 2013). CSIS often publishes direct recommendations for \npolicy-makers53 and\
    \ tends to focus on the importance of defending against \nintrusions from hostile\
    \ countries, exploitation from cyber-crime and strengthening \npublic-private\
    \ partnerships (CSIS, 2008; 2010; ZHENG; LEWIS, 2015; ZHENG, \n2015).  \n  The\
    \ private sector: private companies \nThe private sector’s54 cyber security landscape\
    \ is complex and diverse. It \ninvolves the interests of banks, telecommunication\
    \ companies, healthcare \norganizations, the energy sector, large and small technology\
    \ companies and defense \ncontractors. Private companies are responsible for the\
    \ ownership and operation of \nphysical and digital infrastructures, and thus,\
    \ central actors in the CIP and in the \nInternet debate. The technology sector\
    \ has backed much of the development in ICTs \nand in technology standards in\
    \ the past decades. Companies within the sector range \n                     \
    \                                      \n51 It should be noted that most of RAND’s\
    \ resources come from the DoD.  \n52 Most of CSIS experts have career background\
    \ in politics and are familiar with governance debates. \n53 One example is the\
    \ 2010 report ‘Cybersecurity: two years later’ that makes an assessment of the\
    \ \nimplementation, by the federal government, of the recommendations formulated\
    \ in the 2008 ‘Se-\ncuring cyberspace for the 44th presidency’. Its evaluation\
    \ is that difficulties in implementation of \nrecommendations reveals internal\
    \ political disputes over the importance of cyber security and the \nrole of federal\
    \ government in its implementation. \n54 By definition, the term ‘private sector’\
    \ encompasses pro-profit sectors of society that are not \ncontrolled by the state.\
    \ In this work, the term is employed as a synonym of private companies.  \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n91 \nfrom hardware and software developers,\
    \ internet service providers (ISPs), online \nservice providers (OSPs), the antivirus\
    \ industry and cyber security companies.  \nThe growing importance of these actors\
    \ is also linked to the political impli-\ncations of their commercial and corporate\
    \ practices (DENARDIS, 2014). \nCorporations’ policies for the usage of products\
    \ and services and determinations \nover whether to interrupt hosting services\
    \ are constitutive of the political power of \nprivate corporations. Individual\
    \ privacy online, including policies of data collection \nfor advertising purposes,\
    \ is usually defined and delimited by social media end user \nagreements (DEIBERT,\
    \ 2013; DENARDIS, 2014). Private actors respond to \npolitical events as much\
    \ as they carry their core commercial functions55, sometimes \nwithout the direct\
    \ constraints faced by democratic governments. Hence, “where \ngovernments could\
    \ be, and are, constrained by constitutional protections of free \npress and free\
    \ speech, private industry is not necessarily subject to these same \nconfinements”\
    \ (DENARDIS, 2014:12).  \nSince the Internet infrastructure and operation is mostly\
    \ a responsibility of \nthe private sector, governments need its compliance to\
    \ carry out their attempts to \n‘secure’ cyberspace. Deibert (2013) calls this\
    \ phenomenon a “downloading” of \npolicing responsibilities. In practice, functions\
    \ like monitoring users’ activities \nonline, filtering access and controlling\
    \ content/information are delegated to private \ncompanies that run and operate\
    \ the Internet. And when these actors are entrusted \nwith powers and responsibility\
    \ to police the Internet, issues of transparency and \naccountability arise (DEIBERT,\
    \ 2013; DENARDIS, 2014). The risk is that, by \ngranting lawful access responsibilities\
    \ to the private sector, a market for the \ncommercial exploitation of data is\
    \ created. As Deibert argues, “as companies are \nforced to surveil/police their\
    \ networks and data, products and services are emerging \nthat enable them to\
    \ do so more effectively and efficiently” (DEIBERT, 2013:223). \nPublic-private\
    \ relations are filled with struggles between security agencies \nand private\
    \ actors (DEIBERT, 2013; HERN, 2015). These struggles sometimes \ngenerate patterns\
    \ of cooperation, as is the case of Google’s cooperation with the \nNSA after\
    \ reported attacks on its networks (NAKASHIMA, 2010; DEIBERT, \n             \
    \                                              \n55 DeNardis (2014) gives an account\
    \ of that political power in the case of Wikileaks. She argues that \nthe decision\
    \ by the company hosting the website to cut off services to Wikileaks was a response\
    \ to \nthe release of sensitive diplomatic correspondence data. Similar attitudes\
    \ by Amazon were taken \nbecause of “violations to its terms of service”. \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n92 \n2013; HARRIS, 2014) or the case of\
    \ AT&T’s alleged participation in a NSA’s \nwiretapping program (DEIBERT, 2013;\
    \ HARRIS, 2014). But in most cases, there \nare conflicting interests. One example\
    \ is how the US government and technology \ncompanies have struggled over the\
    \ issue of encryption. The FBI took the lead, \ncriticizing Apple Inc.’s ‘ubiquitous’\
    \ encryption because it supposedly brings more \ninsecurity to the country by\
    \ making it harder to catch terrorists and other criminals \n(HERN, 2015). Companies\
    \ like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and IBM also \nconflicted with the NSA after\
    \ the disclosure of their alleged participation in \nprograms of data collection.\
    \ The core of the conflict revolved around the possible, \nprevious awareness\
    \ these companies had of the NSA’s program (ACKERMAN, \n2014; REITMAN, 2014; GALLAGHER;\
    \ GREENWALD, 2014). At stake were the \neconomic consequences of an eventual cooperation\
    \ with the agency’s practices.  \nNeither of these companies, however, focuses\
    \ on the commercialization of \ncyber security solutions or term their products\
    \ and services so. It was the conflict \nor cooperation among themselves (and\
    \ between them and government agencies) \nthat generated concerns that were close\
    \ to cyber security. Therefore, a particular \ngroup of private actors deserves\
    \ scrutiny: companies that work or have oriented \nthemselves to the cyber security\
    \ market, or ‘cyber security companies’. The \ndenomination is broad and it does\
    \ not intend to describe the wide range of products \nand services these actors\
    \ may offer, nor does it give a clue about the possible \nrelations these companies\
    \ can develop with and within governments. But it signals \na common ground between\
    \ this group of companies, which is their focus on a \nmarket of cyber security\
    \ service and solutions. Within this group, the work \nidentified companies commercializing\
    \ antivirus services and companies \ncommercializing sets of services understood\
    \ as ‘cyber security solutions’ for private \ncompanies and governments. \nAccording\
    \ to the Cybersecurity Ventures research and market intelligence’s \nreport (2015),\
    \ the market for cyber security was estimated in about US$ 75 billion \nin 2015\
    \ and is expected to grow to US$170 billion by 2020. This burgeoning market \n\
    has commercial and federal clients as main consumers: the antivirus industry plus\
    \ \nhundreds of companies working with consulting and operational support, incident\
    \ \nanalysis and response, risk management, APTs, cloud and IoT security, security\
    \ \ndata, intelligence and big data analytics/security have oriented themselves\
    \ to \ncommercial demands from industry and other companies. Some of them also\
    \ \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n93 \ncommercialize with governments,\
    \ although they do not work exclusively in the role \nof defense contractors,\
    \ as is the case of Symantec. The defense and intelligence \nsectors are the largest\
    \ contributors to cybersecurity solutions, as the report states. \nSeveral regions\
    \ around the world have expanded markets for cyber security \nas a direct response\
    \ to rising cyber espionage and other information age security \nconcerns (MORGAN,\
    \ 2015; DUNN CAVELTY, 2009a; DEIBERT, 2013). This, \nin turn, has generated requirements\
    \ for IT professionals, feeding the demand for a \n‘cyber security workforce’\
    \ in both the private and the public sectors. It is the market \nfed by government\
    \ agencies the main responsible for this expansion, particularly in \nthe US.\
    \ A report by Market Research Media suggests that “the annual cyber security \n\
    spending of the US Federal government is bigger than any national cyber security\
    \ \nmarket (…), exceeding at least twofold the largest cybersecurity spending\
    \ coun-\ntries” (MARKET RESEARCH MEDIA, 2015). Over the past decade, the US \n\
    federal government has spent $100 billion on cyber security and $14 billion more\
    \ \nhave been budgeted for 2016. The DHS alone spent more than 3% of its 2014\
    \ \nbudget on cyber security and budgeted about US$582 million just for its EINSTEIN\
    \ \nintrusion detection system.  \nIn face of the competitive atmosphere and the\
    \ market prospects for \ninformation technology security, partnerships between\
    \ public and private sectors \nbecome strategic. And once again, government funding\
    \ fuels a parcel of this market. \nAn interesting movement of the DHS was to announce\
    \ the opening of an office in \nthe Silicon Valley, in order to “improve relations\
    \ between tech companies and the \ngovernment, spread the government’s ideology\
    \ on cybersecurity throughout the \ntech industry, and recruit top talent that\
    \ might otherwise head to the private sector” \n(MORGAN, 2015). Similarly, the\
    \ DoD announced it would provide venture capital \nfunding to Silicon Valley’s\
    \ startups to help the Pentagon in developing advanced \ncybersecurity and intelligence\
    \ systems (CAMERON, 2015).  \nStruggling with cyber security companies for the\
    \ federal market of cyber \nsecurity are also some of the traditional contractors\
    \ and giants from the defense \nsector. Defense contractors in the cyber security\
    \ market focus on the federal \ngovernment as a client, although attempts of expanding\
    \ to the commercial market \nexperiences exist (MORGAN, 2015). These actors’ re-orientation\
    \ from traditional \ndefense activities to cyber security can be read as a strategy\
    \ to capture a parcel of \nthe crescent budget directed at the sector (BRITO;\
    \ WATKINS, 2011). Through its \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    94 \nproducts, solutions and categorizations, these actors work to endorse or\
    \ dismiss the \nversions of cyber security56 proposed by the distinct governmental\
    \ spheres, and en-\nter in direct competition with information technology firms\
    \ for government \ncontracts. \nIn sum, the cyber security champ is constituted\
    \ by the hacking community \nand independent cyber security experts, security\
    \ and policy experts working \nthrough think tanks, governmental bureaucracies\
    \ and private companies. The latter \nsplit into distinct categories that range\
    \ from non-ICT related industry to ISPs and \nsocial media networks. Whilst conflicts\
    \ between these categories and governments \ntouch cyber security tangentially,\
    \ the group of private companies commercializing \ncyber security solutions offers\
    \ a more comprehensive view of the dynamics of \nmarketized security. Agents in\
    \ the champ dispose of distinct arrangements of \ncapital: experts working in\
    \ think tanks have their reputation and personal \nconnections; independent professionals\
    \ have their knowledge of code; private \ncompanies often benefit from economic\
    \ capital and quality workforce and, on the \nother side of the spectrum, government\
    \ bureaucracies hold a significant amount of \nsymbolic capital and a bigger power\
    \ to ‘name’ risks to cyber security. Particularly \nin the latter case, the power\
    \ of naming comes accompanied by generous funding to \nprivate contractors. \n\
    Most of these actors struggle for economic resources, and federal spending \n\
    has been particularly desirable for private firms, governments and politicians\
    \ alike. \nIn turn, the issue of definition becomes particularly relevant, as\
    \ certain conceptions \nof cyber security may prevail over others and justify\
    \ resource allocation to specific \nsectors, such as national security agencies\
    \ or the military. As Brito and Watkins \n(2011) note, the inflation of cyber\
    \ threat benefits not only calls for increased \nregulation, but also the government\
    \ spending on the cyber security industry. \nIf, because of their prominence in\
    \ the development, ownership and operation \nof computer and networked technologies,\
    \ private companies are believed to have a \nrole of greater importance in securing\
    \ cyberspace, it is necessary to inquire about \nthe implications of the activities\
    \ of those companies commercializing security in \ncyberspace for security in\
    \ cyberspace itself. Underlying this questioning is an \n                    \

    \ further both the practices of these companies and the relations \nthey establish\
    \ to strengthen their position in the cyber security champ. In the attempt \n\
    to answer to market tendencies and securing pressures, these companies also play\
    \ \nan important role in defining understandings of cyber security through their\
    \ prac-\ntices and these practices can, perhaps unwillingly, have undesired effects\
    \ for \ncyberspace security. The next section will delve further in the dynamics\
    \ of the cyber \nsecurity market by investigating the practices of some of these\

    \ software and services seeking to enhance the \nsecurity of the Internet user,\
    \ the practices of private companies within the universe \nof cyber security are\
    \ pivotal for shaping perceptions of security and insecurity in \ncyberspace.\
    \ Economic assumptions, which play a fundamental role in defining the \nnature\
    \ of the service to be offered, are part of the logic of these practices, but\
    \ they \nalone cannot explain the technical and market choices made by most of\
    \ these \ncompanies. Risk-oriented thinking is part of the collective habitus\
    \ in this champ, \nand also a fundamental factor in the development of cyber security\
    \ solutions and \non corporate decision-making. This can be observed in advertisements,\
    \ threat and \nrisk assessment reports, fact-sheets and other documents sponsored\
    \ and published \nby companies in this segment, as well as what is made available\
    \ in their websites. \nThe adoption of certain technical standards complements\
    \ the background \nknowledge that informs the practices of these companies. This\
    \ requires that \ncompanies have a specialized workforce with sufficient knowledge\
    \ of code. \nNetwork security and resilience requirements are the most important\
    \ technical \nstandards for a company working with sensitive data and businesses.\
    \ They are \nemphasized by public authorities and also are mandatory for companies\
    \ contracting \nout with the government. \nThe cyber security market is populated\
    \ by companies advertising for the most \ndistinct products and solutions focused\
    \ on enhancing security in cyberspace, as in \nthe case of antivirus companies;\
    \ on identifying and preventing cyber-attacks; and \non helping governments and\

    \ services can be quite useful for \ncountering intrusions. \nIn order to understand\
    \ the dynamics of the cyber security market, the work \nwill investigate the practices\
    \ of the group of companies advertising for cyber secu-\nrity solutions. Strictly,\
    \ cyber security companies, independent of the size, advertise \nand commercialize\
    \ products and services that offer a certain degree of protection \nagainst malicious\
    \ software, cyber intrusions and cyber-attacks to the customer. In \nsome cases,\
    \ services can also include risk assessment. But there are so many \npossibilities\
    \ other than ‘defense’ in the market for cyber security that other services, \n\
    not directly suited to provide protection to the customer or the machine, can\
    \ be \nfound under the label ‘cyber security solutions’. One example is the companies\
    \ that \ncommercialize zero-day vulnerabilities with governments. Another example\
    \ is the \ncommercialization of overtly ‘offensive’ cyber security solutions,\
    \ which can be \nquite troublesome, particularly in face of the alliance between\
    \ the private sector and \nintelligence agencies.     \nThe work also pays attention\
    \ to the ‘solutions,’ the products and services that \nthe selected companies\
    \ advertise in their websites and commercialize with \ngovernment and commercial\
    \ customers. It analyzes the nature of the security \nmeasures proposed in each\
    \ case. The selection of the products and/or services was \nnot exhaustive, as\
    \ there is a variety of solutions out there in the market. Instead, the \ndata\
    \ collected was delimited to the products and services in which the target \n\
    audience is comprised of governments and other companies; to the ‘main’ products\
    \ \nand services within the companies’ portfolio; and specifically, in the case\
    \ of \nproducts, to those offering the most complex set features, instead of those\
    \ offering \nthe most basic ones (for example, the option was to analyze the ‘pro,’\
    \ ‘advanced’ \nand ‘enterprise’ solutions, instead of the ‘free,’ ‘small business’\
    \ ones). When it was \npossible, the selected solutions were combined with the\
    \ main security strategy \nadopted by the company (for example, Endgame’s “adaptive\
    \ defense” approach).  \nDidactically, these companies are separated in three\
    \ categories: antivirus (or \nendpoint security companies), IT companies advertising\
    \ for cyber security solutions \n(with a special focus on those in the zero-day\
    \ market), and traditional defense \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    97 \ncontractors that had oriented themselves to cyber security57. This division\
    \ suggests \nthat, although said companies are all together in the cyber security\
    \ business, com-\npeting for a part of the market, cyber security solutions are\
    \ not the same, nor are \ncompanies’ strategies to address them. In some cases,\
    \ the partnership between \ncompanies and their clients can offer fruitful means\
    \ of protection for individual \nusers, but there are cases in which this alliance\
    \ can result in violations of privacy \nand in the increasing of insecurity in\
    \ cyberspace. \n4.2.1. Antivirus companies \n Among the private companies commercializing\
    \ cyber security services, \nantivirus companies are perhaps those that seem to\
    \ be closer to the individual \ncomputer user. The advent of antivirus technology\
    \ dates back to the 1980s, but it \nbecame widespread with the development of\
    \ connectivity and the diffusion of \nmalicious software, such as viruses, through\
    \ networked computers. Most antivirus \ncompanies made their name developing software\
    \ for preventing, detecting and \nremoving malicious software from the user’s\
    \ machine. Research and discovery of \nnew ‘threats’ has been fundamental for\
    \ this end and a complementary work by these \nactors (see KASPERSKY, 2016). \n\
    The work has scrutinized market strategies of some of the largest and most \n\
    well-rated antivirus companies: Avast Antivirus, Kaspersky Labs, Symantec, \n\
    McAfee, Bitdefender and Avira. These agents work with distinct strategies to \n\
    consolidate, maintain or increase their position in the market. The acquisition\
    \ of \nstart-ups, a common strategy among companies working in the IT sector,\
    \ allows \nthem to have access to new technologies and to the qualified engineers\
    \ working for \nstart-ups. In 2014, Avast Antivirus has, for example, acquired\
    \ the start-up Inmite, \nspecialized in mobile technology. This move can be read\
    \ as a response to market \ntendencies associated with the expansion of mobile\
    \ technology and its adoption by \nmillions of users (and, additionally, good\
    \ acquisitions bring the attention of \ninvestors). These deals have cost millions\
    \ of dollars, as the 2007 acquisition of the \n                              \
    \                             \n57 Although traditional defense contractors are\
    \ placed in a category of their own, it should be noted \nthat some antivirus\
    \ and IT companies regularly contract out with (or at least sell products to)\
    \ the \nU.S. government, as is the case of Symantec and Endgame.  \nPUC-Rio -\
    \ Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n98 \ndata leakage prevention company VONTU\
    \ by Symantec indicates (the deal cost \naround US$350 million).  \nMost companies\
    \ opt for ‘untangling’ their products in different categories of \nprotection,\
    \ such as antivirus protection, internet protection and protection against \n\
    (or removal of) ransomware, just to give a few examples (see BITDEFENDER, \n2016;\
    \ AVIRA, 2016). All the companies studied in the present work distinguish \nbetween\
    \ threats to the home user and to businesses (small and large), offering dis-\n\
    tinct, more complex and diversified services to the latter, such as threat analysis\
    \ and \nconsulting. Companies like Kaspersky Antivirus and Symantec also provide\
    \ \npublicly available and insightful threat analyses and reports on cyber security.\
    \ \nKaspersky labs has made long term predictions about the evolution of APT attacks\
    \ \nand the ‘balkanization’ of the Internet58, and also provided an overview of\
    \ cyber \nsecurity in 2015, describing it as “full of cyber-criminals that are\
    \ proving hard to \ncatch and cyber-espionage actors that are even harder to attribute”\
    \ (KASPERSKY, \n2016).  \nSymantec openly works with the U.S. government civilian\
    \ and defense \nagencies. The company hosts an annual government symposium that\
    \ works as a \nbridge between federal cyber security standards and requirements\
    \ and the \ntechnology offered by the private sector. According to the company’s\
    \ website, \n“we’ve combined our proven private-sector technology with federally\
    \ focused \ninvestments in R&D, and our people are well-versed in Federal standards\
    \ and \nrequirements. We understand the issues you face because we’ve examined\
    \ them, \nand addressed them, for years.” (SYMANTEC, 2016)  \nOne important aspect\
    \ of this niche is that the changing dynamic of cyber-\nthreats forced the antivirus\
    \ sector as a whole to reinvent itself and led some industry \nbusinessmen to\
    \ declare the ‘death’ of the antivirus industry (YADRON, 2014; \nMCAFEE, 2015).\
    \ The reality behind these exaggerated claims is, however, closer \nto an “antivirus\
    \ is dead! Long live antivirus!” logic than to failures in businesses \nmodels.\
    \ The word ‘reinvention’ assesses the way in which companies started \ncommercializing\
    \ solutions for dealing with the operation of malware, identity theft, \n    \
    \                                                       \n58 The Balkanization\
    \ of the Internet is a process where the Internet is ‘divided by countries.’ The\
    \ \nrisk is that the availability of Internet could be controlled by attacks on\
    \ the service junctures that \nprovide access across different boundaries (See\
    \ KASPERSKY, 2016). \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n99 \nransomware\
    \ and vulnerability exploitation. Discourse goes as follows: protecting \nagainst\
    \ intrusions in a computer is still a part of every product, but this alone is\
    \ no \nlonger enough. New strategies and solutions are required to deal with the\
    \ always \npresent risks of being connected: risks to intellectual property, to\
    \ the safety of user \ninformation and to the operation of ‘critical’ sectors.\
    \ \nThe declaration of the ‘death’ of the antivirus in practice is likely a market\
    \ \nstrategy for some companies to announce new products and services oriented\
    \ at \ntackling risks other than computer viruses and worms. The conflict of terminology\
    \ \nthat distinguishes companies insisting on the relevance of the term ‘antivirus’\
    \ \n(SALMI, 2014; AVIRA, 2016; BITDEFENDER, 2016) from companies using the \n\
    term ‘endpoint protection’ to describe the wide range of cyber security solutions\
    \ for \nhome users and corporate clients distinctly (SYMANTEC, 2016; KASPERSKY,\
    \ \n2016; MCAFEE, 2016) seems apparent. McDonald (2012), argues that this termi-\n\
    nological struggle is misplaced, for “AV hasn’t been AV for years”. This market,\
    \ \nwhich he terms “Modern Endpoint Protection Platforms” includes a variety of\
    \ \nprotection models: signature and non-signature based, corporate, home user\
    \ or \ngovernment focused (MCDONALD, 2012; see KASSNER, 2012). Most of these \n\
    companies have added cyber risk management to the portfolio.59 \nContemporary\
    \ endpoint protection, or its less fashionable cousin “antivirus \nprotection,”\
    \ are both anchored on a specific approach to cyber security, which \nfocuses\
    \ on defensive security. Defensive security focuses on the protection of \ninformational\
    \ devices, networks and online activities from possible cyber-threats, \nand is\
    \ often characterized by its responsive nature, that is to say, the response comes\
    \ \nafter the threat is discovered (ROSEQUINST, 2013). It focuses on the system’s\
    \ \nenvironment and on hardening the endpoint’s infrastructure against cyber-threats\
    \ in \nsuch a way that the risk of intrusions is minimal. \nTable 4: Antivirus\

    \ mainly), complexity and the fact that \nthey are paid, instead of being for\
    \ free. For strategic reasons, free solutions are often \nsimpler and have a less\
    \ sophisticated technology compared to the paid ones. \nEndpoint protection tends\
    \ to include antivirus and firewalls in the same product. \nThe products on the\
    \ first column have as their main focus the detection and reaction \nto an unauthorized\
    \ access within the system. They are characterized for having a \ndefensive approach\
    \ to cyber security, also termed ‘passive defense’.  \nAlthough complex, the focus\
    \ of this group of solutions is on detecting \nadvanced threats and malware, fighting\
    \ them off and securing data and online \nactivities, such as shopping and e-mailing.\
    \ Some include behavioral monitoring,60 \nvulnerability protection and basic risk\
    \ management platforms. The defensive \napproach includes what Dewar (2014) terms\

    \ observing deviations from the expected behavior of the user or system.  \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n101 \nand other kinds of detection technologies.\
    \ The main goal is to reduce the chances \nof an unauthorized access. Resilient\
    \ cyber defense, in turn, involves ensuring the \nuninterrupted functioning of\
    \ critical infrastructures and services that depend on \nnetworked communications.\
    \ According to the author, “Resilience itself is predi-\ncated upon accepting\
    \ that incidents will occur and focusing on the ability to recover \nfrom those\
    \ incidents, either returning to the original state or adapting to generate a\
    \ \nnew, adjusted state” (DEWAR, 2014:16). \nTwo exceptions to the tendency to\
    \ adopt more defensive solutions are \npresented by Symantec’s DeepSight Intelligence\
    \ and by Kaspersky’s Anti-Targeted \nAttack, two services aiming at anticipating\
    \ and mitigating cyber security risks. \nFocused on corporate clients, they advertise\
    \ services oriented at keeping the \ncustomer’s teams informed of vulnerabilities,\
    \ providing advanced analysis of \nattacks and, in the case of DeepSight Intelligence,\
    \ sharing the motivations and \ntechniques of ‘threat actors,’ in order to improve\
    \ decision-making and allow the \nimplementation of ‘proactive controls’ before\
    \ the attack occurs (see SYMANTEC, \n2016). These services are provided by specialized\
    \ teams, which are also capable of \nassessing and testing the customers’ response\
    \ program for security risks.  \nSymantec’s DeepSight solution and Kaspersky Anti-Targeted\
    \ Attack are \nlabeled as active defense because of their strong investigative\
    \ purpose. These two \ncases may indicate that at least a parcel of the antivirus/endpoint\
    \ industry is slowly \nadopting a more open risk prevention and mitigation approach.\
    \ The term ‘active-\ndefense’ will be better discussed in the subsection 4.2.3.,\
    \ in this chapter, in face of \nthe popularity of such measures in the universe\
    \ of defense contractors. It is \nimportant to note, however, that active defense\
    \ is distinguished from pure defense \nin that its focus is to guarantee security\
    \ by going beyond the endpoint environment. \nIt does not suffice to maintain\
    \ the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the \nsystem or the network\
    \ in the most cost effective and unobtrusive manner. Defending \nis crucial, but\
    \ it is also necessary to investigate (and sometimes punish) the attacker.  \n\
    The ‘endpoint protection’ terminology concurs with the main discursive \nstrategies\
    \ employed by security and defense circles to secure cyberspace, which \ntend\
    \ to emphasize the risk of third party exploitation of systems vulnerabilities\
    \ and \nthe consequent possibility of loss, theft and/or disruption of (critical)\
    \ information \n(see ANDERSON, 1996; and ANDERSON et al., 1999, for example).\
    \ To counter \nthese risks, a parcel of the antivirus industry is slowly turning\
    \ its attention to \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n102 \nservices\
    \ oriented at identifying, understanding and/or mitigating risks in order not\
    \ \nonly to stop cyber-attacks as they happen, but also to prevent their emergency.\
    \ But \nas this ‘preemptive’ approach becomes more and more popular within cyber\
    \ \nsecurity circles, it feeds the expansion of the cyber security market beyond\
    \ the \ndefense-oriented antivirus industry, with new companies being created\
    \ and \ntraditional defense companies orientating themselves to answer to this\
    \ burgeoning \nmarket (DEIBERT, 2013; HARRIS, 2014).  \n4.2.2. IT companies \n\
    \ Some companies have diversified their products to offer cyber security \nsolutions\
    \ that go beyond endpoint security. Companies such as FireEye (and its \nsubsidiary\
    \ Mandiant) combine a set of strategies, from using the expertise \nengineers,\
    \ computer analysts and researchers in order to develop real-time threat \nintelligence\
    \ to prevent, monitor and respond to intrusions, to offering consulting \nservices\
    \ and risk analysis to clients (WOODS, 2014). These companies are not \nfocused\
    \ exclusively on ‘defensive’ cyber security (nor do they openly advertise for\
    \ \noffensive solutions). Instead, they propose “adaptive” and active defense\
    \ solutions \n(FIREEYE, 2016).  \n The cyber security company Mandiant became\
    \ known in 2006, after the \npublication of the APT1 espionage report, where it\
    \ presented documented evidence \nof cyber-attacks targeting the U.S. and other\
    \ English-speaking countries’ \norganizations perpetrated by the People’s Liberation\
    \ Army. The company is part of \na group of private actors that focused on building\
    \ its own sources and methods of \nintelligence collection and analysis and it\
    \ was acquired by FireEye, another cyber \nsecurity firm, in January 2014 for\
    \ the sum of US$1 billion. \nMandiant’s release of the APT1 report was a successful\
    \ marketing move. The \nissue of Chinese espionage was known to government authorities,\
    \ but very little \ndiffused outside the government circles. The report not only\
    \ made the company an \nauthority on the subject, it also generated huge interest\
    \ from the media and other \nsectors of society and raised the fear of APTs \n\
    But, as Harris (2014) notes, whereas Mandiant’s business focused on \ninvestigating\
    \ cyber intrusions, FireEye’s aimed to prevent them. And with \nMandiant as its\
    \ subsidiary, FireEye could now both rely on its good reputation and \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n103 \noffer a more diversified set of\
    \ solutions to its clients and lead a business model \nwhereas cyber security\
    \ became a form of “technology enabled insurance” \n(WOODS, 2014). Post-acquisition,\
    \ Mandiant is now portrayed as a consulting \nsubsidiary. As FireEye announces\
    \ in its own website, Mandiant works in \n“responding to the most critical cyber-security\
    \ incidents and empowering organi-\nzations to protect their most critical assets”\
    \ (FIREEYE, 2016).  \nAnother group of companies announces a radically distinct\
    \ business: the \nbusiness of zero-day vulnerabilities – and, in some cases, the\
    \ potential exploits \nderived from them61. Some of them not only commercialize\
    \ active defense, but also \nopenly advertise for cyber “offense” solutions, as\
    \ the case of Hacking Team and \nthe already-out-of-business VUPEN (now ZERODIUM).\
    \ This group is more often \nthan not directly in touch with agencies in the intelligence\
    \ and security community, \nbut it also demonstrates interest in the commercial\
    \ cyber security market. VUPEN, \nfor example, had a threat protection program\
    \ to both government and corporations, \nbut the commerce of exploits was – at\
    \ least, in theory – restricted to the first. \nFidler (2014) notes that the market\
    \ for zero-day vulnerabilities is part of a \nlucrative trade in cyber weapons\
    \ and “unlike cryptography and nuclear \ntechnologies, where the government played\
    \ a strong role in development, the \nprivate sector zero-day vulnerability market\
    \ and the discovery of zero-days by in-\nhouse government teams seem to have largely\
    \ developed simultaneously” \n(FIDLER, 2014:10). One particularity of this market\
    \ is the value of secrecy – an \nexploit of a vulnerability can only be developed\
    \ if the vulnerability in question is \nnot patched or explored by other agent.\
    \  \nMost “boutique” companies62 operate in the “gray market” for zero-day \n\
    vulnerabilities. The gray market involves the trade between sellers, governments\
    \ \nand other non-criminal clients. Distinctly from the black market, the gray\
    \ market is \nlegal. But unlike the white market, composed by reward programs\
    \ to researchers \n                                                          \
    \ \n61 A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in a computer or software code, often\
    \ unknown by the pro-\ngrammer or the company responsible for its development.\
    \ An exploit is a code written specifically \nto take advantage of this vulnerability\
    \ (see FIDLER, 2014). For an empirical study on zero-day \nattacks, see Bilge\
    \ and Dumitras (2012). \n62 Ollman (2012) employs the term “boutique” to refer\
    \ to vulnerability vendors. The term implies \nthat this group offers a niche\
    \ of a high-priced product, if compared to the “exploit development \necosystem”\
    \ that involves bigger companies and the government, on the side of the “gray”\
    \ market, \nand the illegal activities in the black market.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n104 \nthat report vulnerabilities63, despite its legality,\
    \ this market can create adverse \nconsequences for cyber security (FIDLER, 2014).\
    \  \nThe Italian company Hacking Team serves as an example of this issue. \nDetails\
    \ about its business became available at WikiLeaks after the company was \nhacked.\
    \ Publicly, the company offers offensive cyber security services to law en-\n\
    forcement and national security organizations, using malware and zero-day \nvulnerabilities\
    \ to gain access to a target’s network (HERN, 2015; HACKING \nTEAM, 2016). The\
    \ company affirms it provides tools to the government to fight \ncrimes and terrorism\
    \ and that it does not sell to non-State actors nor to governments \nblacklisted\
    \ by the U.S., the E.U., the U.N., NATO or ASEAN. But the leaked \ndocuments suggest\
    \ that it could have been commercializing with non-State actors, \nas one invoice\
    \ reveals a deal of a three-month access to its remote control tool, \nwhich allows\
    \ hacking into Android, Blackberry and Windows devices, between the \ncompany\
    \ and a private Brazilian firm (see HERN, 2015). The Citizen Lab of the \nUniversity\
    \ of Toronto has reported that a surveillance backdoor commercialized by \nthe\
    \ company was used to target a Moroccan citizen journalist group (MARQUIS-\nBOIRE,\
    \ 2012), and that U.S. based data centers were used as part of foreign \nespionage\
    \ anchored on Hacking Team’s remote control tool (MARCZAK et al., \n2014).   \n\
    The DoD and the FBI are among the U.S. government agencies that \ncontracted Hacking\
    \ Team's services, according to the documents leaked in 2015. \nThe FBI has been\
    \ using the remote control software since 2011 in its Remote \nOperations Unit.\
    \ The agency deploys malware in investigations, but details on these \nefforts\
    \ are blurred (CURRIER; MARQUIS-BOIRE, 2015).  \nBesides Hacking Team, there are\
    \ a few other companies that became known \nfor their involvement in the zero-day\
    \ market. Endgame is a good example of this. \nThe company now orients itself\
    \ to the wider market of commercial defense \nproducts, but the previous involvement\
    \ with the zero-day market granted it the title \nof the ‘Blackwater of hacking.64’\
    \ As a contractor of intelligence and defense \n                             \
    \                              \n63 Some companies have reward programs for security\
    \ researchers that communicate vulnerabilities \nin their software, but since\
    \ it is not their main business, rewards are not higher as in the commercial \n\
    market. For a detailed study on these vulnerability reward programs, see Finifter\
    \ et al. (2013).  \n64 The reference is made to the role of the polemical private\
    \ security contractor Blackwater (and of \nprivate security companies, broadly)\
    \ in the Iraq War.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n105 \ncompanies,\
    \ Endgame used to sell zero-day exploits for millions of dollars a year, \npromising\
    \ it would not disclosure the discovered vulnerabilities to software makers \n\
    that could patch them. This business became public after Anonymous, the hacker\
    \ \ngroup, published e-mails from Endgame’s partner HBGary Federal.  \nThe “new”\
    \ business of Endgame allowed the expansion of its services to the \ncommercial\
    \ cyber security market. The company now offers Big Data solutions and \nsells\
    \ a “vulnerability intelligence” software that works by pulling together infor-\n\
    mation from the customer’s navigation and security systems and pairing it with\
    \ the \ncompany’s own research on malware. (GREENBERG, 2014).   \nGreenberg (2014)\
    \ argues that, although Endgame no longer sells exploits, the \ncompany doesn’t\
    \ deny having businesses with the government and selling the \nagencies tools\
    \ that can be used for offensive hacking. Its CEO avoids commenting \nabout government\
    \ business due to secrecy agreements. It is worth noting, however, \nthat its\
    \ ‘vulnerability intelligence’ service can be employed to discover flaws in a\
    \ \nsurveillance target. And that the company commercializes cyber security solutions\
    \ \nthat allow for offensive measures to be adopted.  \nDistinctly from broader\
    \ commercial defense market, the legal market for \nzero-days is, on its surface,\
    \ restricted to governments. The Snowden leaks showed \nthat, in the year of 2012,\
    \ the NSA contracted a 12-month subscription to VUPEN’s \nexploit service. The\
    \ CEO and head researcher of VUPEN, Chaouki Bekrar, has \nargued that the partnership\
    \ between intelligence agencies and vulnerability sellers \nis nothing but common\
    \ sense: “There is no news here, governments need to leverage \nthe most detailed\

    \ itself as a leading provider of defensive and offensive cyber \nsecurity intelligence\
    \ (see SCHWARTZ, 2013; HARRIS, 2014). \nThe reasons why VUPEN’s business came\
    \ to a term in 2015 are not clear. But \nits founders’ new company, ZERODIUM,\
    \ offers a very similar business model. \nUnlike Endgame, ZERODIUM has not left\
    \ the zero-day market, but instead, it \nacquires zero-day discoveries from independent\
    \ researchers and resells them to its \ncorporate and government clients. In practice,\

    \ Mandiant’s) solutions openly adopt an active-defense \napproach, which the company\
    \ names ‘adaptive-defense.’ The purpose of such \napproach is to go beyond conventional\
    \ security, as ‘it gives security teams a \nfragmented, incomplete view into what’s\
    \ going on in their network. It’s passive and \nblind to broader threat trends’\
    \ (FIREEYE, 2015). The company proposes, instead, \nan anticipatory, more flexible\
    \ and integrated framework that incorporates ‘internal’ \n(the endpoint’s, the\
    \ customer’s) and ‘external’ intelligence provided by the \ncompany’s teams or\
    \ by Mandiant’s consulting services. FireEye products also have \na focus on investigating\
    \ the origins and patterns of threats and attacks, in order to \nprovide the customer\
    \ better risk assessment and incident response.  \nA distinct pattern can be observed\
    \ in Hacking Team’s Galileo. The company \nopenly advertises65 for an offensive\
    \ approach to cyber security. Anchored in the \nmilitary strategy, the offensive\
    \ approach is characterized by the adoption of \nmeasures such as the conduction\
    \ of reconnaissance and surveillance, the \ninterception of communications, the\
    \ denial of access and resources, compromising \n                            \
    \                               \n65 The Hacking Team’s website announces: “we\

    systems and undermining its integrity (the so-called ‘hacking back’), and by \n\
    disabling or destroying assets (ROSENQUIST, 2013). \nAs Hacking Team announces,\
    \ its main customers are governments. The threat \nframework the company emphasizes\
    \ involves the risks of cybercriminals and \nterrorists using mobile phones, tablets,\
    \ laptops and computers equipped with end-\nto-end encryption. The company’s solution\
    \ provides law enforcement and \nintelligence communities a way to bypass this\
    \ ‘barrier’: Galileo, a hacking suite for \ngovernment interception.  \nThe “Hunting\
    \ Cycle” is Endgame’s strategy to counter cyber threats. It has \nfour pillars:\
    \ to survey, to secure, to detect and to respond. The idea of hunting \ncorresponds\
    \ to the ‘proactive, surgical, stealthy pursuit and eradication of \nadversaries\
    \ to protect enterprise networks’ (ENDGAME, 2016), while the response \nstrategy\
    \ to be crafted correspond to including options such as killing malicious \nprocesses,\
    \ deleting persistence, blocking traffic or gathering additional forensic \ndata,\
    \ once the threat is identified. \nThe case of Endgame is slightly distinct, when\
    \ compared to the two previous \ncases. The company does not adopt an openly offensive\
    \ approach. Its focus is on \nturning enterprises into ‘hunters,’ proposing that\
    \ organizations embrace an \noffensive strategy within their networks, instead\
    \ of waiting for the attack to happen. \nThus, despite the possibilities that\
    \ its platform is being used by its government \nclients for surveillance purposes\
    \ (GREENBERG, 2014), the company’s solutions \nwere categorized as ‘active defense.’\
    \ This option is justified by a lack of exclusively \noffensive measures in the\
    \ company’s advertisements, but not necessarily by the lack \nof offensive possibilities\
    \ in the its solutions. Active defense encompasses the \npossibility of adopting\
    \ offensive measures in face of an attack, but offense is not \nthe only way to\
    \ deal with a security threat.    \nZERODIUM’s approach to security will remain\
    \ uncategorized, due to the \ninsufficient data provided by the company. Although\
    \ the work found indicators that \nits business remained similar to its antecessor,\
    \ VUPEN, the actual dynamics of its \nvulnerability research program could not\
    \ be properly scrutinized to the point the \nresearch could provide a precise\
    \ characterization about its approach to cyber \nsecurity. It would be possible\
    \ to discuss that there is a tendency within the zero-day \nmarket that indicates\
    \ an inclination to an offensive or, at least, active defense bias. \nIt would\
    \ also be possible to consider that the vulnerabilities that ZERODIUM \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n108 \nacquires and commercializes with\
    \ other companies and governments are used for \noffensive measures, such as surveillance,\
    \ but it is not possible to characterize the \ncompany’s business as inherently\
    \ offensive with the little data available about it.  \nAmong the companies involved\
    \ in the vulnerability and intelligence milieu, \nthere is an attempt to expand\
    \ business beyond the government sector, but no \nintention of leaving it. Some\
    \ businesses rearrangements, like Endgame’s and \nZERODIUM’s, can possibly signal\
    \ an attempt to look at both market niches. \nPressures to secure cyberspace contributed\
    \ to creating this commercial security \nmarket for offensive and defensive cyber\
    \ security, cyber warfare and surveillance \ntechnologies. Thus, despite being\
    \ relatively small companies, there is a real concern \nabout the implications\
    \ of the commerce of intelligence solutions and vulnerabilities \nfor security\
    \ and privacy online. But these ‘boutique’ companies are far from being \nalone\
    \ in the market for offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. Some bigger \n\
    actors are willing to grab their own parcel of the cyber ‘pork’, to use Brito\
    \ and \nWatkins (2011) term, for themselves. \n4.2.3. Defense contractors \nAs\
    \ Deibert (2013) notes, this last category is the most secretive among the \n\
    private actors investigated so far. It is composed by traditional defense contractors\
    \ \nwhose businesses with the U.S. government dates back to the Cold-War period.\
    \ \nSince the late 1990s, in face of restrictions to the defense budget, some\
    \ of these \ntraditional contractors have oriented themselves to the burgeoning\
    \ cyber security \nmarket (DEIBERT, 2013; HARRIS, 2014; BRITO; WATKINS, 2011).\
    \ \nThe secrecy around these companies’ businesses makes it more difficult to\
    \ \ninvestigate their strategies with precision. However, some complementary tools,\
    \ \nsuch as the description of the job positions being offered and reports on\
    \ the \nacquisitions of technology companies working with cyber security by those\
    \ defense \ngiants can offer a good reinforcement for the journalistic texts and\
    \ the information \nmade available both at the websites of these companies and\
    \ in the WikiLeaks files. \nThe strategy of acquiring minor companies is, in itself,\
    \ a good thermometer for \nmeasuring the kind of business that major defense contractors\
    \ have with their \nclients inside the government.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n109 \nFor example, it can show how the current market niche for\
    \ these defense \ncontractors can be quite confined to the aerospace, defense\
    \ and intelligence sectors \nof the government. According to Morgan (2016), these\
    \ sectors were among the \nlargest contributors to the gross revenue in the cyber\
    \ security market, in the year of \n2015. In the past decade, the sum spent by\
    \ the U.S. federal government in cyber \nsecurity was of around US$ 100 billion\
    \ and the Obama administration has budgeted \naround US$ 14 million for 2016.\
    \  \n The fact that some defense contractors, such as Boeing and General \nDynamics,\
    \ opted for selling out their cyber security businesses companies with \ncommercial-oriented\
    \ products may indicate that they are leaving the commercial \ncyber security\
    \ market for companies that want to work with corporate customers, \nand focusing\
    \ on the government clients instead (MORGAN, 2016). Raytheon Co., \none of the\
    \ biggest defense contractors, has adopted a distinct strategy to conciliate \n\
    commercial and government demands, leaving for its subsidiary Forcepoint the task\
    \ \nof dealing with the commercial market. Another big defense contractor, Northrop\
    \ \nGrumman Co., has made a similar move with the creation of its new business\
    \ unity, \nAcuity Solutions Corp. Defense contractors have a lot to gain in their\
    \ business with \nthe government agencies, but the dynamics of working with quite\
    \ secretive tasks \nand of working with corporate necessities may be very distinct.\
    \ This may help to \nexplain why some companies opted for leaving the commercial\
    \ cyber security \nsector, while others created separate businesses to answer\
    \ to the demands of their \ncommercial customers.  \nAll of the major defense\
    \ companies investigated (Raytheon, Northrop \nGrumman Corp., Bae Systems, Boeing,\
    \ General Dynamics, Booz Allen Hamilton \nand Lockheed Martin) have now entered\
    \ the cyber security business. They’ve done \nso by acquiring smaller several\
    \ cyber security companies and, at the same time, by \ndeveloping their own capabilities.\
    \ Boeing announces it has services on CIP, \nnetwork surveillance and data analytics,\
    \ information security, mission assurance \nand information operations capabilities,\
    \ whilst Northrop Grumman adds situational \nawareness, modeling and simulation,\
    \ cloud security and supply chain to the \nportfolio. It refers to the work of\
    \ its cyber security team as being made by \n“developing systems and solutions\
    \ that are revamping the entire cyberspace \ncontinuum of defense, exploit, and\
    \ attack.”  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n110 \nThe involvement\
    \ of defense contractors in the vulnerability exploit business \nhas recurrently\
    \ appeared in the media and in the literature on cyber security \n(SCHNEIER, 2012;\
    \ 2013; DEIBERT, 2013; BRITO; WATKINS, 2011; HARRIS, \n2014), but it is quite\
    \ difficult to assess, if compared to their smaller and less \ntraditional competitors.\
    \ Raytheon, for example, announces a series of cyber security \nsolutions for\
    \ integrated defense systems and intelligence. The list of products (and \nthe\
    \ forms of cyber security covered by them) that the company offers is the biggest\
    \ \namong the contractors investigated. But what calls attention is less the vast\
    \ cyber \ncapabilities the company has and more the possible functionalities of\
    \ these \ncapabilities – the “what are they being used for?” question. \nThe hint\
    \ may come from quite an unexpected source. Some of the company’s \njobs announcements\
    \ call for reverse-engineers and vulnerability researchers to be \npart of a “highly-skilled\
    \ and dynamic team that performs vulnerability research and \nexploit development”\
    \ in the incorporated Blackbird Technologies, a cyber security \ncompany specialized\
    \ in providing surveillance and secure communications to spy \nagencies and special\
    \ operation units. The acquisition of Blackbird by Raytheon has \ncost about US$\
    \ 420 million (REUTERS, 2014). The position for Insider Threat \nAnalyst at the\
    \ same company requires the candidate to have experience with \ncounter-intelligence\
    \ and to “collaborate with the intelligence community and \nFederal Civil partners\
    \ to share and collect cyber threat data for use in strategic threat \nassessments,\
    \ prioritization of resources and development of lead generation.” \n(RAYTHEON,\
    \ 2016). \n In the same vein, General Dynamics requires professionals familiar\
    \ with \nzero-day exploits or capable of analyzing unpatched vulnerabilities.\
    \ The company’s \ncyber security solutions are part of its “Mission Systems”,\
    \ integrating Command, \nControl, \nCommunications, \nComputers, \nIntelligence,\
    \ \nSurveillance \nand \nReconnaissance (C4ISR) systems for all domains plus cyber.\
    \  \nDefense contractors got quickly involved in the market for offensive cyber\
    \ \nwarfare and surveillance technologies. Since the 1990s, the number of cyber-units\
    \ \nin these companies has increased. For example, the Booz Allen Hamilton’s cyber\
    \ \nunit, which focuses on intelligence, was built in the years of 1996 and 1997\
    \ by the \nformer NSA’s director John M. McConnell. And, like McConnell, many\
    \ others \nhave employed the knowledge acquired while working for defense and\
    \ intelligence \nagencies to create and improve intelligence and cyber security\
    \ units in private \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n111 \ndefense\
    \ contractors. Taking advantage of the so-called revolving door between \ngovernment\
    \ and businesses, government employees head off to the industry after \nserving\
    \ intelligence and defense agencies long enough to acquire training, top-\nsecret\
    \ security clearances and professional contacts and acquaintances. Then, they\
    \ \nsell back to government agencies what they’ve learnt during their stay in\
    \ the \ngovernment (HARRIS, 2014). \nTable 6 analyzes the defense contractor’s\

    \ Cyber \nRaytheon Riot Tool** \n**Unadvertised  \nThe first thing that should\
    \ be noted is that Table 6 indicates that defensive \nproducts are not excluded\
    \ from the portfolio of defense contractors. It was identified \nthat General\
    \ Dynamics, Boeing, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin and \nNorthrop Grumman\
    \ offer at least one openly defensive product/service. General \nDynamics defense\
    \ and protection capabilities include, for example, the deployment \nof perimeter\
    \ defenses, protection against zero-days and infrastructure hardening, \nwhile\
    \ Northrop Grumman’s “The FAN” is a layered cyber security defensive model \n\
    to customers building a secure IT architecture.  \nA second thing that should\
    \ be noted is that the table indicates that all the \nactors investigated have\
    \ a core solution that can be easily characterized as ‘active-\ndefense.’ What\
    \ these distinct solutions have in common is the purpose of not only \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n113 \nprotecting a machine, a network\
    \ or the end-user’s online activities, but also \ninvestigating the dynamics of\
    \ the attack and, in some cases, even punishing the \nattacker. The basic trait\
    \ of these products is the fact that the ‘defense’ is not \nrestricted to the\
    \ endpoint environment anymore.   \nDittrich and Hima (2005) define active defense\
    \ as constituted by digitally-\nbased, reactive66 measures that aim at countering\
    \ an intrusion and serve to \ninvestigative, defensive or punitive purposes. These\
    \ measures are non-cooperative, \nin the sense that they are implemented without\
    \ the consent of (at least) one of the \nparties involved or affected by the intrusion\
    \ and they tend to impact a remote system \n(a system that is owned or operated\
    \ by a third party). According to the authors, \n“these tactics range from more\
    \ benign information-gathering measures (e.g., trace-\nbacks) that impact remote\
    \ systems without impairing their ongoing operations and \nfunctions to more aggressive\
    \ measures (e.g., denial of service counterattacks) \nexpressly intended to inhibit\
    \ or even stop the operations and functions of remote \nsystems” (DITTRICH; HIMA,\
    \ 2005:3-4). \nA distinction must be made between the offensive and active defense\
    \ \napproaches. Offensive security is an independent approach which focuses on\
    \ using \noffense to enhance cyber security. Active defense is also an independent\
    \ approach, \nwhich can comprise both non-offensive and offensive measures. In\
    \ the work, the \noption was for categorizing as offensive only those products\
    \ with a manifest \noffensive purpose (such as conducing cyber operations, or\
    \ running a platform for \ngovernment surveillance). The remaining products were\
    \ considered as active \ndefense because their purposes are not exclusively offensive,\
    \ although offense can \nbe an option in some cases. \nLockheed Martin’s Pallisade\
    \ is an intelligence platform that allows the \ncollection of intelligence about\
    \ an adversary in order to identify the motives and \ntactics employed in an attack.\
    \ It operates under the Cyber Kill Chain framework, a \ncyber threat model developed\
    \ to detect a persistent adversary, analyze the attack \nprogress and develop\
    \ ‘actionable intelligence’ (LOCKHEED MARTIN, 2016). Bae \nSystem’s Threat Investigation\
    \ Solution and Threat Intelligence Management \nPlatform and Booz Allen Hamilton’s\
    \ predictive intelligence solution which include \n                          \
    \                                 \n66 In the sense that measures are implemented\
    \ following the detection of an unwanted intrusion and \nare intended to counter\
    \ it.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n114 \nCyber4Sight, Insider4Sight,\
    \ Global4Sight and CyberReady solutions, play a similar \nrole as they focus on\
    \ the detection and investigation of the behavior of the attacker.   \nIf compared\
    \ to the other companies, Northrop Grumman’s website is less \nspecific about\
    \ the products developed by the it. It is possible to identify the line of \n\
    security within which the company works, as it advertises having cyber intelligence\
    \ \ncapabilities “for collecting, fusing and analyzing cyber data to provide actionable\
    \ \ninformation and situational awareness for operators in support or conducting\
    \ cyber \nmissions,” cyber resilience capabilities to serve “as contingencies\
    \ for compromised \nnetworks and platforms to sustain basic functionality and/or\
    \ restore an optimal \nstate,” active cyber defense capabilities to enable defenders\
    \ to “more readily \ndisrupt, mitigate and neutralize cyberattacks and vulnerabilities\
    \ through proactive \nanticipatory actions and/or direct engagement with adversaries\
    \ in a controlled \ncyberspace environment;” it is working in the full spectrum\
    \ of cyber operations, \nthrough the integration of cyber and non-kinetic capabilities\
    \ in order to plan, map, \naccess and maneuver undetected through targeted networks;\
    \ and it employs “D5 \neffects67” against adversaries, “to shape and prepare the\
    \ operational environment, \nand/or work in conjunction with other non-kinetic\
    \ effects” (NORTHROP \nGRUMMAN, 2016). These “Full Spectrum Operations” signal\
    \ that the company \nengages, with the U.S. government, in real-world, cyber operations,\
    \ with \npurportedly offensive ends, as the employment of the D5 effects indicates.\
    \   \nThe presence of security operations centers (even if in the form of threat\
    \ \nintelligence teams or analytics centers) is a feature that is worth noting.\
    \ Basically \nevery defense contractor investigated offers a service of this kind,\
    \ oriented at \nproviding cyber security consulting, training, threat investigation\
    \ and tracking and \nincident response. These centers are not always advertised\
    \ as services in \nthemselves. They can be equally ‘implied’ in other solutions,\
    \ as is the case of \nLockheed Martin’s Analysis on Demand service, in which intelligence\
    \ analysts \ninvestigate and analyze threat-related data in order to provide risk-mitigation.\
    \  \nIn general, the imperatives of risk-mitigation and prevention underlie most\
    \ of \nthe advertises of cyber security companies. But regarding active-defense,\
    \ it \n                                                           \n67 D5 effects\
    \ refers to the U.S. Air Force “Degrade, Deceive, Destroy Deny, Disrupt” strategy\
    \ to use \nthe cyberspace domain in its advantage. It represents an open position\
    \ within the U.S. government \nregarding the possibility of attacking adversaries\
    \ through cyberspace. \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n115 \nbecomes\
    \ a part of another imperative, that of prediction. The notion of predictive \n\
    intelligence is anchored on the attempt to, through the careful tracking and \n\
    investigation of a threat, predict future risks and adopt measures to anticipate\
    \ to \nthem. \nBooz Allen Hamilton offers a whole line of products under the label\
    \ of \npredictive intelligence. According to the company’s website, anticipatory,\
    \ \npredictive intelligence is fundamental for an effective security posture.\
    \ In this sense, \npredictive intelligence involves the anticipation, prevention\
    \ and response to global \nthreats. This requires not only advanced IT techniques,\
    \ such as big data analytics, \nbut also a technological savvy workforce.  \n\
    It should be noted that an exception figures on Table 6. Raytheon Riot Tool \n\
    escapes the main methodology employed in the work as it was not advertised in\
    \ the \ncompany’s official website, once it was secretly developed on the request\
    \ of the \nFBI. Raytheon Riot Tool is a social-media, data mining application\
    \ in which the \nmain function is to analyze whether an individual is to be judged\
    \ or not a security \nrisk. The existence of this application came to public in\
    \ a The Guardian’s 2013 \narticle, where the company recognized to have developed\
    \ and shared the application \nwith the U.S. government and the industry, as part\
    \ of a joint national security \nresearch and development effort (GALLAGHER, 2013).\
    \  \nA final, interesting remark, concerning the solutions offered by the selected\
    \ \ndefense contractors is the fact that, as secretive as these companies might\
    \ be about \nsome of their solutions, as in the case of Raytheon Riot Tool illustrates,\
    \ the \ninvolvement with the intelligence sector is publicly recognized and advertised\
    \ as a \nstrategic advantage for both the companies and the national security\
    \ community. \nBae Systems describes itself as a global provider of communications\
    \ and \nintelligence technologies. Boeing includes among its offerings critical\
    \ \ninfrastructure protection, network surveillance and data analytics, information\
    \ \nsecurity, mission assurance and information operations capabilities. Northrop\
    \ \nGrumman emphasizes its intelligence capabilities. Lockheed Martin offers to\
    \ its \ngovernment clients cyber security solutions for intelligence-driven defense.\
    \ \nGeneral Dynamics advertises that through its capabilities, it defends the\
    \ nation’s \ncritical cyber resources and networks, and it assists its defense\
    \ and intelligence \ncustomers with the solutions it develops. Raytheon’s cyber\
    \ security products are \npart of a broader Intelligence, Information and Services\
    \ business. Lastly, Booz \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n116 \n\
    Allen argues for a collaborative framework with the defense and intelligence \n\
    community to tackle the challenge of cyber risks.  \nThe products and services\
    \ on Table 6 are a small parcel of what is offered by \ndefense contractors to\
    \ governments and commercial customers. Comparing the \nthree categories of cyber\
    \ security companies studied in the work, the solutions \nadvertised by the last\
    \ group were the ones that presented the most diversified set of \napproaches\
    \ to cyber security. This can be explained by the variety of solutions they \n\
    offer, if compared to antivirus and IT companies. Considering only the categories\
    \ \ninvestigated (commercial/business, paid and pro/advanced), each company within\
    \ \nthe antivirus group presented an average of 8,5 main products and services,\
    \ while \nin the case of IT companies the average was of 4. In the case of Endgame,\
    \ \nZERODIUM and Hacking Team, the products and services portfolio was relatively\
    \ \nsmall (two main products/services in Endgame’s case and one in Hacking Team’s\
    \ \nand ZERODIUM’s).   \n This may be an indicative that not only are defense\
    \ contractors investing \nheavily in the cyber security field: they are also investing\
    \ in a specific approach to \ncyber security, one that even in the case when it\
    \ is not openly offensive, it can be \nmarked by some offensive contours. In general,\
    \ cyber security companies are not \nfocusing alone on ‘hardening the infrastructure’\
    \ and waiting for it to be capable of \nblocking an attack anymore. Even manifest\
    \ defensive products and solutions come \nwith at least a basic risk-management\
    \ tool. The most recent appeal to active defense, \nand even openly offensive\
    \ approaches, should bring some reflections about the con-\ncept of security that\
    \ these companies are producing through their practices.  \nThe next chapter discusses\
    \ the impacts of active defense and offensive \napproaches on the concept of security.\
    \ It discusses the patterns found in this \nchapter’s analysis, analyzes the disputes\
    \ among companies for a dominant approach \nto security and develops a reflection\
    \ about the current dominant paradigm of \nsecurity and about the place of defensive,\
    \ active defense and offensive approaches \nin it.   \nThe problem with a “digital\
    \ arms trade” (DEIBERT, 2013:348) for products \nand services involving active\
    \ is its possible impact over actual security in \ncyberspace. This trade is part\
    \ of a market that has been irresponsibly fueled by the \ncompetition around the\
    \ definition of cyber threats and cyber security and by the \ngrowing hype around\
    \ threats coming from cyberspace. As Deibert (2013) observes, \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n117 \nthere is a growing legitimacy in the adoption of\
    \ ‘retaliatory’ measures and the \nincreased intelligence-gathering capabilities\
    \ of private companies (traditional \ndefense contractors or not) to prevent constant\
    \ penetrations in their networks. These \ncompanies now offer services that allow\
    \ them to hunt threats, and preventively \nassess risks, in contrast to companies\
    \ that offer passive defense solutions.  \n \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº\
    \ 1412452/CA\n118 \n5. An analysis of cyber security companies’ disputes over\
    \ \nthe production of cyber security  \n  In the previous chapter, it was argued\
    \ that cyber security companies produce \nspecific conceptions of security through\
    \ their practices, that is to say, through the \nadvertisement and commercialization\
    \ of cyber security solutions. Three approaches \nwere identified in each sub-category\
    \ of company: a defense-oriented approach, \npredominantly found in the antivirus\
    \ companies’ products; an offensive approach \nrising in the context of IT companies\
    \ in the zero-day market; and a mixed approach, \nnamed active-defense, mainly\
    \ adopted by defense contractors. The current chapter \ndiscusses the characteristics\
    \ of each approach and the symbolic disputes happening \nwithin the champ for\
    \ the prevalence of a certain category over the others.  \nThe main argument is\
    \ that the three approaches to cyber security have \nsomething in common: to a\
    \ certain degree, all rely on risk-based practices and on a \nrisk-oriented approach\
    \ to security. The role of risk varies within each case, as it can \nbe used to\
    \ justify the development of less-intrusive and more defensive cyber \nsecurity\
    \ solutions, or the employment of a more aggressive approach to combating \ncyber\
    \ threats. Based on this, it is argued that having ‘risk’ as a common ground \n\
    does not equalize the implications, for security, of the three approaches.  \n\
    \ The chapter is divided in four moments. Firstly, it discusses the semi-\nconscious\
    \ disputes underlying the approaches identified in the research. Disputes \nare\
    \ partially unconscious because companies do not always recognize themselves \n\
    as a part of a dispute for the production of a concept. On the other hand, most\
    \ \ncompanies assume to be in direct competition with their equals, based on the\
    \ liberal, \ncapitalist assumption of free-competition. \nIt is argued that there\
    \ is a prevalence of active-defense, in contrast with an \nopenly offensive or\
    \ exclusively defensive approach that is strategic to the \ncompanies’ relations\
    \ with the State. As is the case with the use of force, in the U.S. \n(and in\
    \ most countries in the world), only state-actors and the corporations under \n\
    contract with them have the legal endorsement to process and collect intelligence\
    \ \nand to conduct offensive cyber operations. But as a certain degree of suspicion\
    \ falls \nover the idea of a company ‘hacking back,’ or simply proactively hacking\
    \ a third \nparty for whatever the purpose, the label of active defense comes\
    \ as a relief \nseparating the more assertive investigation operations in order\
    \ to attribute the attack \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n119\
    \ \nand the use of ‘security through obscurity’ measures from active hacking activities.\
    \ \nIn this sense, active-defense may be seen as a viable solution not only for\
    \ defense \ncontractors, but also for other cyber security companies, among the\
    \ antivirus \nindustry and IT companies, that commercialize products and services\
    \ with such \napproach. \nSecondly, the chapter analyzes the predominance of an\
    \ anticipatory approach \nto security in most of the solutions analyzed, and the\
    \ strength it has when active \ndefense is concerned. The argument is that anticipatory\
    \ cyber security has in the \ncurrent paradigm of risk a fertile ground. As argued\
    \ in chapter two, this paradigm \nis marked by the existence of complementary\
    \ attitudes towards risk. Active defense \ninvokes a paradigm of prevention: when\
    \ everyday cyber security is concerned, the \nadoption of measures to anticipate\
    \ the risk, relatively known in nature, but far less \npredictable when it comes\
    \ to the moment of the attack, is portrayed as the best \nstrategy to combat it.\
    \ The exception is the precautionary nature residing in the \ninvocation of the\
    \ ‘digital disaster’ (HANSEN; NISSENBAUM, 2009). Risks to \ncritical infrastructure\
    \ and the threat of cyber terrorism, when directly addressed by \ncompanies, may\
    \ result in different strategies to deal with risk, but follow a very \nsimilar\
    \ path in regards to the discourse adopted by governmental instances. \nThirdly,\
    \ the chapter traces a correlation between active defense and the \nmarketization\
    \ of security, discussed in chapter one. The argument is that the \npredominance\
    \ of active defense as a viable solution to fight cyber threats and the \nappeal\
    \ that more offensive strategies are slowly conquering within industry are both\
    \ \ncoherent with the entanglement between states and markets that has accompanied\
    \ \nthe development of the cyber security champ. The growing popularity and \n\
    acceptability of invasive solutions result from the traditional bridges constructed\
    \ \nbetween the government and industry, through partnerships, contracts and the\
    \ \nworkforce mobility.  \n Lastly, the work considers the implications of the\
    \ preference for active \ndefense for the concept of security. The core of active\
    \ defense strategies is a process \nof intelligence-acquisition about the threat\
    \ in order to trace proper risk-mitigation \nstrategies and to proportionate adequate\
    \ ‘incident response’, in which the former \nand latter terms have a wide semantic\
    \ nature. The information and techniques \ngathered in the investigative process\
    \ allow for better prevention, and as cyber \nthreats are said to evolve and improve\
    \ each day, the cycle of hunting for more \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº\
    \ 1412452/CA\n120 \ninformation about them continues. In the midst of this cycle,\
    \ the temptation of going \non the offensive becomes strong. And, in some cases,\
    \ the imperative of active de-\nfense can even conceal more offensive attitudes\
    \ towards the adversary.  \n5.1. \nThe symbolic disputes for the production of\
    \ cyber security \nThis section continues the analysis started in the previous\
    \ chapter, expanding \nthe discussion about the characteristics of each approach\
    \ to cyber security. It \nconsiders each approach as a strategy, adopted in the\
    \ context of the champ to \nproportionate companies a certain advantage when the\
    \ governmental market is \nconcerned, and analyzes how the disputes among private\
    \ companies, recognized as \npart of a liberal-capitalist natural dynamic of free-competition\
    \ among private \nentities, produce dominant understandings of security, in general,\
    \ and of cyber \nsecurity, in particular. \nIn economics, competition is a constitutive\
    \ aspect of the market process. It is \nbelieved to be beneficial for economic\
    \ performance, productivity and innovation \n(OECD, 2014). Private companies,\
    \ in general, have in the struggles with other \ncompanies for the offer of goods\
    \ and services in the market a commonsensical, long \nestablished, social norm.\
    \ Less emphasized, however, is the underlying competition \nfor establishing particular\
    \ understandings about the businesses they’re in. Thus, \nwhen the work claims\
    \ that companies engage in symbolic struggles, it stresses that, \nas with other\
    \ social universes, the dispute for the production of specific \nunderstandings\
    \ regarding cyber security is not always expressly recognized by \nprivate companies\
    \ as such. Disputes are commonly portrayed as natural outcomes \nof the market\
    \ dynamics, inside a context of search for profit and scarcity, and not \naiming\
    \ directly at the production of a specific meaning about something. \nThe advertisement\
    \ of products and services is one important strategy in the \nstruggles within\
    \ the cyber security champ. It sets the companies’ strategies and \nperceptions\
    \ regarding the most pressing risks and comes as a response to pressures \nwithin\
    \ the political and military spheres to make cyberspace more secure to national\
    \ \nsecurity ends. These products and services also manifest the companies’ distinct\
    \ \nperspectives on how cyber-threats are best combated. By posing the advertised\
    \ \nsolution as the solution against a certain security issue, they advocate that\
    \ the \napproach they adopt is the most suitable in the context of the selected\
    \ target \naudience.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n121 \nKaspersky’s\
    \ Anti Targeted Attack may be useful to counter APTs in an or-\nganization’s network,\
    \ while Total Security for Business is the most suitable to \nprotect a company’s\
    \ endpoints. These two solutions belong to the same company, \nbut have distinct\
    \ approaches to security – the first is active defense, the second, \ndefensive.\
    \ – They tell something about the nature of the dispute at stake: on one \nside,\
    \ companies advocate for an exclusive view of security, as is the case of Hacking\
    \ \nTeam’s offensive approach. In most cases, however, the disputes do not involve\
    \ \ncompanies defending a given view instead of another. Different approaches\
    \ have \nbeen observed within the same company’s portfolio (see Tables 4, 5 and\
    \ 6 in topic \n4). This indicates that what these disputes are about is the allocation\
    \ of specific \nviews of security to specific groups of customers. \nThe defensive\
    \ approach tends to be associated with the home user and small \nand mid-sized\
    \ businesses. Cyber security solutions falling under a defensive view \nof security\
    \ all presented an emphasis on hardening the endpoint’s infrastructure and \n\
    combating the threat once it was inside the system, network, or similar. This\
    \ focus \ncan be related to the security requirements of the targeted groups,\
    \ which tend to be \nlow if compared to governments, critical infrastructure operators\
    \ and big \ncorporations or private entities dealing with sensitive information,\
    \ such as banks. \nIn this perspective, a local store will hardly face the same\
    \ security threats a big \nmultinational corporation will and even if it does,\
    \ the risks would be allegedly \nlower. The antivirus companies that have expressly\
    \ affirmed to be working with \ngovernments, critical infrastructure sectors or\
    \ larger corporate clients have \npresented solutions in the active defense spectrum.\
    \  \nIn those solutions where defensive cyber security was portrayed as unable\
    \ to \naddress the dynamics of current cyber-threats, the option was for a distinct\
    \ approach \nto security. The inability of exclusively defensive measures to counter\
    \ current \nthreats is associated with the way that newest IT technological developments,\
    \ and \nparticularly the IoT, open new avenues to attacks. To address the new\
    \ security \nchallenges posed by advancements in technology, security would do\
    \ better if \nreformulated. \nThe urge to reformulate the concept of (cyber) security\
    \ answers to the needs \nand specificities of two particular groups: government\
    \ and big corporations. \nCompanies that have in these groups their main target\
    \ audience have presented \nmore solutions in the offensive and active defense\
    \ spectrum, if compared to those \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    122 \nwith a focus on smaller, commercial customers. Among other things, this\
    \ suggests \nthat governments and corporations have at their disposal alternatives\
    \ like using ad-\nvanced intelligence-gathering techniques to go on the hunt68\
    \ and, in some cases, \neven retaliating an adversary’s attack.  \nAs shown in\
    \ chapter three, the overtly offensive alternative has been \nadvocated by Hacking\
    \ Team. Hacking Team publicly announces to commercialize \nits surveillance solutions\
    \ only with governments, as it sustains that security \nproduced by law enforcement\
    \ (and counter terrorism) is a fundamental right of the \ncitizen. Most recently,\
    \ after researches indicating that the platform has been used \nby non-democratic\
    \ governments to surveil citizens (MARQUIS-BOIRE, 2012; \nMARCZAK et al., 2014),\
    \ the company has updated its customer’s policy to settle \nthat it does not commercialize\
    \ with countries blacklisted by the U.S., the European \nUnion and NATO.  \nThe\
    \ offensive alternative is particularly worrisome as it implies that agents \n\
    actively engage in surveillance-like activities and even in limited, cyber-war\
    \ like \nscenarios. And as Rosenquist (2013) indicates, the offensive security\
    \ approach is \ndriven by the military doctrine of controlling the battlefield\
    \ and taking the fight to \nthe enemy. It legitimizes a series of controversial\
    \ measures, from surveillance to \nhacking another party’s system, in the name\
    \ of security and law enforcement.  \nAlthough some people advocate for an increased\
    \ adoption of overtly \noffensive measures by private companies – or believe that\
    \ this is only a matter of \ntime (INFORMATION WEEK, 2013; ROSENQUIST, 2013),\
    \ the imperative of \nactive defense remains the most adopted by cyber security\
    \ companies. This solution \nis most often associated with the challenges faced\
    \ by big, commercial and \ngovernment clients, which tend to be equated, if not\
    \ almost equalized.   \nIn contrast with Hacking Team, for example, Endgame has\
    \ a more diversified \ncustomers base. And with such a wider base, it has adjusted\
    \ the way it addresses \nsecurity challenges. It advertises that the experience\
    \ with the intelligence \ncommunity and the department of defense is helpful for\
    \ its commercial customers, \nas the challenges faced by government actors have\
    \ eventually become \ncommonplace. Marked by an involvement with the zero-day\
    \ market, the company \n                                                     \
    \      \n68 “Going on the hunt” suggests the use of intelligence to gain information\
    \ about an attack and those \nbehind it. It is a constitutive step of both active\
    \ defense and offensive products and services.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n123 \nnow uses subtle terms, such as offense within a company’s\
    \ network, and allies the \nterms ‘defense’ and ‘hunt’ to characterize its commercial\
    \ strategy. It equalizes the \nsecurity requirements of private actors and governments,\
    \ and pictures its customers \nas hunters. As such, Endgame characterizes the\
    \ security of private companies as \nmarked by an imperative of reacting and gathering\
    \ intelligence about an attack.  \nThe alternative of active defense is strategic\
    \ to cyber security companies’ re-\nlations with their commercial customers, but\
    \ most fundamentally with state-actors. \nTo big corporate clients, active defense\
    \ opens up a way in which intelligence-\ngathering about an attack and the countermeasures\
    \ it allows can be used to their \nfavor at a payable cost. In what concerns the\
    \ companies’ relations with their \ngovernment clients, active defense may come\
    \ as a euphemism to the combined use \nof intelligence collection and (aggressive)\
    \ countermeasures. This is because under \nthe U.S. law69, companies are often\
    \ discouraged to adopt tactics such as hacking \nback, except with the government’s\
    \ endorsement. \nIn the context of the cyber security market,70 active defense\
    \ establishes a \nsemantic separation between assertive investigative operations\
    \ and ‘security \nthrough obscurity71’ from offensive activities outside the victim’s\
    \ network, such as \nhacking back. On the one hand, it addresses the perceived\
    \ common security \nchallenges faced by the target audience. But it also attends\
    \ to the expectations of all \nthe parties concerned (vendors and customers alike):\
    \ active defense becomes a \nviable solution for those cyber security companies\
    \ that aim at the strategic, \ngovernment market. The most sophisticated the capacity\
    \ of the product/service to \n‘anticipate’ the threat, the bigger is its appeal.\
    \ At the same time that it rises as a \ndominant conception of security, it becomes\
    \ a strategy in the midst of the disputes \nfor this specific piece of the market.\
    \ In the struggles to delimit which security is the \nmost suitable to whom, cyber\
    \ security companies compete to define how \ngovernments and other relevant, commercial\
    \ customers should protect themselves. \n                                    \
    \                       \n69 Criminal offenses under the U.S. Computer Fraud and\
    \ Abuse Act (18 USC 1030). \n70 The military definition for active defense involves\
    \ the adoption of measures to both detect, ana-\nlyze, identify and mitigate threats\
    \ and offensive capabilities and resources. In the same vein goes \nthe definition\
    \ proposed by Dewar (2014). \n71 The concept refers to the reliance on the secrecy\
    \ of the design and/or implementation of a network, \nendpoint or system as a\
    \ method to assure its security. See Anderson (2001).  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n124 \n5.1.1. Disputes between openly offensive security,\
    \ defensive security and \nactive defense \n At first sight, openly offensive,\
    \ defensive and active defense solutions seem \nto coexist peacefully in the cyber\
    \ security market, each one specifically aiming at a \ncertain kind of customer.\
    \ There are, nevertheless, disputes between these competing \napproaches to security\
    \ which manifest in studies and texts that make the case for \none or other approach.\
    \ One fundamental issue at stake is the possibility of granting \nbroader, legal\
    \ authorizations of the use of ‘hacking back’ by private actors.72 \nThere is\
    \ little disagreement over the importance of defensive measures. \nDefense is\
    \ a constitutive part of offense and active defense, and it is an approach in\
    \ \nitself. Contestations revolve around the reliance on purely defensive measures,\
    \ on \nthe option for equating cyber defense solely to the hardening of the infrastructure\
    \ \nand of the resilience of the machine and network. Those making the case for\
    \ active \ncyber defense or for the adoption of an openly offensive strategy argue\
    \ that defense \nalone does not suffice to protect against cybercrime and other\
    \ cyber threats \n(DEWAR, 2014; GLOSSON, 2015; STRAND, 2015).   \nThe research\
    \ has observed that those making the case for active defense \nseldom conflict\
    \ with the proponents of an openly offensive approach. In some \ncases, they establish\
    \ a distinction between both approaches, considering that \noffense is a prerogative\
    \ of governments and their contractors (and of companies \nthat sell these solutions\
    \ exclusively to governments), whilst active defense may \nhave a broader range.\
    \ What is often established is that active defense is \ndistinguished from offense\
    \ because it comprises more than just the possibility of \nhacking back (DENNING,\
    \ 2014; DEWAR, 2014; STRAND, 2015).   \nThe active defense approach and the debate\
    \ concerning its elements derive \nfrom the U.S. military doctrine. When discussing\
    \ a framework for active defense, \nDenning (2014) argues that this is an approach\
    \ to cyber defense which is multi-\ndimensional, with four dimensions: the scope\
    \ of effects (if they are either internal \nor external), the degree of cooperation\
    \ (if it’s cooperative or non-cooperative), the \ntype of effects (if it involves\
    \ collecting, sharing, blocking or adopting preemptive \n                    \
    \                                       \n72 For a debate on legal interpretations\
    \ of the hacking back alternative in the U.S. Computer Fraud \nand Abuse Act,\
    \ see Steptoe (2012).  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n125 \n\
    measures against an attack), and the degree of automation (if it is automatic\
    \ or in-\nvolves human action). The author even considers that, in the case of\
    \ the “cyber”, \nprivate entities are expected to provide strong defense and active\
    \ defense in order \nto defend their network, and these actors may be authorized,\
    \ by laws, contracts and \npolicies, to conduct certain active cyber defense measures,\
    \ but does not delve \nfurther into the legal and ethical aspects of the use of\
    \ active defense by private \nactors. \nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is a\
    \ legal barrier to the full employment \nof active defense measures, since it\
    \ requires the private entity to have an \nauthorization before it engages in\
    \ ‘hacking back’ or similar activities. There is a \ndebate over how the act is\
    \ to be interpreted to allow private companies to legally \nengage in this kind\
    \ of activity (STEPTOE, 2012) and, having this legal restriction \nin consideration,\
    \ some have proposed a legal framework for the use of active \ndefense by private\
    \ actors (GLOSSON, 2015). As Dittrich and Hima (2005) observe, \nin some cases,\
    \ companies adopt active defense measures without involving law \nenforcement\
    \ agencies, either due to the pace of cyber-attacks against their networks \n\
    or due to concerns with the effects of making an attack public to the company’s\
    \ \nreputation. \nThe case for the use of active defense by private companies\
    \ on their own \nbehalf has put some pressure on how the Computer Fraud and Abuse\
    \ Act is to be \ninterpreted while, at the same time, it has been positive for\
    \ the commerce of this \nkind of solution. The pressure that some authors have\
    \ made to argue that merely \ndefensive measure are not enough, and that defense\
    \ has to be more reactive \n(STRAND, 2015) indicates that there is a broader movement,\
    \ in the U.S., in favor \nof adopting active defense as the main strategy for\
    \ commercial and governmental \ncyber security. By avoiding a direct contestation\
    \ of the offensive approach, the \nproponents of active cyber defense save for\
    \ private actors the possibility of \ndisposing of the full-spectrum of active\
    \ defense measures for combating cyber \nthreats – hacking back included. \n5.1.2.\
    \ Risk and anticipatory cyber security \nA very interesting pattern that has been\
    \ perceived in the course of the research \nis the reliance on a risk-oriented\
    \ approach to security. To a certain extent, defensive, \noffensive and active-defense\
    \ products and services have all focused on reducing or \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n126 \nanticipating cyber risks (the end), through either\
    \ hardening the endpoint \ninfrastructure (defensive measures) or investigating\
    \ the pattern of behavior of the \nthreat, as a form of anticipating and preventing\
    \ future attacks from happening (the \nmeans).  \nIn the context of the disputes\
    \ among companies, the imperative of anticipating \nto risks appeared as a leveler\
    \ tendency. Thus, to a certain degree, it is possible to \naffirm that the practices\
    \ hitherto analyzed all rely on a risk oriented approach to \nsecurity. They have\
    \ all focused on solutions to mitigate risk or preventing it from \ntaking place,\
    \ in the first place. According to Ewald (2002), the preventive attitude \nrelies\
    \ on the ability of scientific knowledge and technical control to reduce the \n\
    probability of risk.  \nThe current security paradigm73 offers anticipatory security\
    \ a fertile ground \nto flourish. It is marked by distinct, complementary attitudes\
    \ towards the possibility \nand probability of a risk to happen: providence, prevention\
    \ and precaution74.  Under \nthe prevailing paradigm, the process of securing\
    \ an undetermined number of fluxes \nthat compose everyday life comprehends three\
    \ dimensions in which a body is \nsubject to protection, due the inherent permeability\
    \ of the flux and the risks it poses; \nto control, in which the distinction between\
    \ good and bad fluxes is established \nthrough processes of identification, localization\
    \ and selection; and to regulation, so \nexcesses are to be avoided and a certain\
    \ equilibrium can be reached (GROS, 2012).   \n Defensive measures to a certain\
    \ extent are measures of prevention in that, \nthrough protective measures set\
    \ in face of the inherent permeability of the machine, \nprevention falls within\
    \ the walls of the machine’s security, with little or no \nconsistent human interaction.\
    \ The prevention is somewhat anterior and not directly \ndependent on a specific\
    \ attack. It presupposes that without the assurance that a \nmachine is properly\
    \ secured, the risk of a silent, unperceived invasion is high.  \nOffensive measures\
    \ seem, at first, at odds with the paradigm of prevention, \nbut within the context\
    \ of cyber security, they actually presuppose a prior process of \nidentifying,\
    \ investigating, localizing and selecting the target. Further, these \n      \
    \                                                     \n73 According to Gros (2012),\
    \ this paradigm is termed biosecurity and focuses on assuring the normal \nfunctioning\
    \ of any given process or flux. The author considers that within this paradigm,\
    \ each flux \n(of information, of people, of markets) arguably deserving protection,\
    \ control and regulation consti-\ntutes a domain of security.  \n74 These institutes\
    \ have been conceptualized previously in the work.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n127 \nmeasures can fall in the preventive specter of anticipatory\
    \ cyber security once \nthey’re moved by the desire to attack sooner than later.\
    \ The perceived risk is that \nnot taking effective providences may encourage\
    \ attackers to keep digging for more \ninformation within critical networks. \
    \ \nThe whole notion of anticipatory security presupposes attempting to exert\
    \ \nsome control on facts that have not happened yet. In some cases, in order\
    \ for this \nkind of control to take place, it is necessary to identify and investigate\
    \ the modus \noperandi of the threat. Anticipatory cyber security rests on the\
    \ premise that: one \nshould avoid future risks by learning from past events.\
    \ As already discussed, active \ndefense relies on the adoption of measures to\
    \ ameliorate the techniques of anticipa-\ntion of the threat. It invokes the paradigm\
    \ of prevention and places anticipation as \nthe best strategy. Here, prevention\
    \ depends on acquiring intelligence about a threat \nand then turning this intelligence\
    \ in favor of the victims of a cyber-attack – and, \nincidentally, of cyber security\
    \ companies’ technical knowledge.  \nA possible exception to the preventive approach\
    \ is the precautionary nature \nof the security concerns motivated by cyber-terrorism\
    \ and the threat of a \ncatastrophic disruption of critical infrastructure (in\
    \ place of everyday disruptions). \nAs chapter two has argued, it was the sense\
    \ of urgency of these ‘irreversible,’ worst-\ncase-scenario risks that served\
    \ as core imperatives of securing cyberspace and \ntriggered several calls for\
    \ public-private partnerships (WHITE HOUSE, 2003; \n2011; GAO, 2016).  \nAlthough\
    \ within the anticipatory spectrum of security, in this case, the \nattitude towards\
    \ risk is quite distinct. The precautionary principle suggests that the \nmere\
    \ possibility of a risk is enough to take precautionary measures, but this risk\
    \ \noften has as characteristic the irreversible nature of the damage (EWALD,\
    \ 2002; \nGROS, 2012). This paradigm does not rely on the predictive nature of\
    \ the most \ncommon, but not least complex, threats due to the nature of the object\
    \ of security \nbeing threatened. In practice, the adoption of the precautionary\
    \ paradigm within \ncyber security adds a degree of urgency to existent attempts\
    \ to control and secure \ncyberspace against risks and may authorize dubious actions\
    \ by companies and \ngovernments in alliance.  \nThis is visible in the case of\
    \ cyber terrorism, where the precautionary \nimperative has served to justify\
    \ the adoption of offensive capabilities by companies \nand governments, and to\
    \ a certain extent, it has contributed to equalize the attitudes \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n128 \nand measures adopted by both. The scenario is slightly\
    \ more complex in the case \nof CIP oriented solutions, as the precautionary attitude\
    \ has led to the preference for \nmore active defense like products and services.\
    \ \n5.1.3. Active Defense and Marketization   \nThe relations between cyber security\
    \ companies and the U.S. government are \na constitutive aspect of the struggles\
    \ within the cyber security champ. As discussed \nin chapter one, through the\
    \ process of marketization, the state authorizes, legiti-\nmates and takes part\
    \ in certain market practices. In the U.S. cyber security champ, \nmarketization\
    \ takes form in the outsourcing of certain governmental functions, such \nas intelligence\
    \ and data collection, cyber operations, maintaining the security of its \ninformation\
    \ systems, and so on, and the constitution of public-private partnerships \nbetween\
    \ IT companies and the federal government as a recognition of the power \nthese\
    \ companies have when it comes to information technologies. \nIt is possible to\
    \ establish a logical correlation between the broader process of \nmarketization,\
    \ that takes place in the cyber security champ, and the predominance \nof active\
    \ defense as a viable solution to combat cyber-threats – or even the appeal \n\
    that certain offensive measures are having in the industry. Before being normalized\
    \ \nin the practices within the cyber security market, concepts such as active\
    \ defense \nand the concurrent adoption of offensive measures to answer cyber-threats\
    \ were \nbeing explored within the U.S. military and policy-making universes (see\
    \ DEWAR, \n2014; NATO CCDCOE, 2013; GAO, 2004; WHITE HOUSE, 2003). \nAs argued\
    \ in chapter two, the cyber security champ, as well as the formulation \nof cyber\
    \ security policies and solutions, has been marked by an entanglement \nbetween\
    \ public and private actors. The sharing of scientific and technical \nknowledge,\
    \ new technologies and security concerns by these parties has become \nboth a\
    \ commonplace and a necessity (WHITE HOUSE, 2003; NORTHROP \nGRUMMAN, 2015). Public-private\
    \ partnerships and defense contracts have been \nworking as bridges, where information\
    \ is exchanged, responses are coordinated and \nthe security concerns of governments\
    \ and companies become even. But these legal \nand political instruments are not\
    \ the only factors that have influenced the \nequivalence of security concerns:\
    \ the traditional mobility of IT specialized \nworkforce between the public and\
    \ private milieus keeps contributing to the ‘import’ \nof ideas from one sector\
    \ to another.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n129 \nPartnerships\
    \ such as the Financial Institutions Information Sharing and \nAnalysis Centre’s\
    \ (FI-ISAC) have resulted not only in information sharing, but also \nin joint\
    \ actions. Botnet takedown operations were coordinated by the UK National \nCrime\
    \ Agency and included the GCHQ, the Europol, the FBI, BAE Systems, Dell \nand\
    \ Kaspersky Labs. A similar operation was carried out by the Microsoft’s Digital\
    \ \nCrimes Unit in conjunction with an ISAC, the FBI, the American Bankers \n\
    Association and others (see HARRINGTON, 2014). \nActions of this kind, as well\
    \ as the defense contracts tying corporations and \ngovernments together, are\
    \ slowly contributing to a wider acceptability of more \n‘invasive’ solutions\
    \ and of the expanded version ‘protect, detect and react’ \nparadigm (OVERILL,\
    \ 2004), which includes active ‘threat intelligence’ gathering \nservices, through\
    \ the activities of CSOCs, being offered by private companies.  \nBut in some\
    \ situations, alliances between governments and corporations can \nresult in the\
    \ development of invasive surveillance tools, such as Raytheon’s Riot \nTool,\
    \ and on the deployment of equally invasive operations as attempts to identify\
    \ \npotential threats to national security. It can further result in attempts,\
    \ by \ngovernment’s agencies and its contractors, to undermine modern Internet\
    \ \narchitecture’s standards, such as cryptography and anonymity, in the name\
    \ of \nnational security and law enforcement. \nAs a security paradigm that has\
    \ traditionally been used by the military, the \nconcept of active (or proactive)\
    \ defense was gradually imported and adapted by \ncompanies within the Defense\
    \ Industrial Base (DIB). The alternative of active \ndefense, in contrast to offensive\
    \ measures or purely defensive options, allows for a \nvast range of actions by\
    \ the security provider – and, consequentially, it also allows \na significant\
    \ range of solutions to be offered in both the commercial and \ngovernment markets.\
    \  \nThe variability of actions allowed by the label grants it a privileged position\
    \ \nin the context of public-private partnerships. Adapted to the reality of commercial\
    \ \ncyber security, many active defense measures rest, without any harm, within\
    \ the \nrealm of legality, as in the case of threat intelligence and services\
    \ like the CSOCs \nshow, whereas government agencies and companies working for\
    \ them can set forth \nthe original definition to expand active defense’s reach.\
    \ In other words, \ngovernments can ‘go on the offensive’ without openly doing\
    \ so. The notion of \nadapting to each kind of threat, promoted in Endgame’s strategy,\
    \ is a constitutive \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n130 \naspect\
    \ of active defense and is consistent with how government and the private \nsector\
    \ understand the cyber-threat nowadays.    \nIn sum, there is an involvement of\
    \ defense and intelligence contractors – or \nother kinds of private actors –\
    \ in state-sponsored cyber operations mobilized under \na paradigm of active defense.\
    \ This ‘dual-use’ paradigm can serve both the commer-\ncial and the defense cyber\
    \ security markets and, in both cases, it raises concerns \nover the expansion\
    \ of active defense beyond the limits of legality (see DEIBERT; \nROHOZINSKI,\
    \ 2010; DEWAR, 2014).  \n5.2. \nActive defense as a security paradigm \nInquiring\
    \ about the implications of the paradigm of active defense for broader \nconceptions\
    \ of security involves recognizing the relevance of cyber security as a \nsecurity\
    \ problem. Between the 1990s and the 2000s, the topic went through a \nprocess\
    \ of securitization, moved by the excessive concerns with the impacts of ITs \n\
    on national and international security. The topic was then introduced to policy\
    \ and \nlawmaking and later recognized as a relevant subject within the countries’\
    \ security \nagendas (see HANSEN; NISSENBAUM, 2009) \nActive defense directly\
    \ influences the way that security issues in the virtual \ndomain are managed.\
    \ Working within a risk anticipation orientation, theoretically, \nit sets forward\
    \ preventive measures in order to foresee the possibility of an attack \nand consequentially\
    \ act before it happens. In practice, it involves detecting, \nidentifying and\
    \ reacting to an attack through a series of overlapping and sometimes \nuncoordinated\
    \ measures involving the measures to perfect the detection, the \ncollection of\
    \ intelligence about a threat behavior or the attacker, the use of \nhoneypots,75\
    \ bogus DNS entries76, identifying the attacker’s IP, using geolocation, \ncreating\
    \ fake websites with malware embedded in them, acquiring remote access to \nan\
    \ attacker’s system and other forms of hacking back. The data gathered through\
    \ \nmost of these processes can be used later in attempts to prevent future attacks.\
    \  \n                                                           \n75 A honeypot\
    \ is a security mechanism that purportedly simulates a computer, system or network\
    \ \nsecurity flaws in order to collect information about an attacker.  \n76 Also\
    \ known as DNS hijacking, it corresponds to the subversion of the resolution of\
    \ Domain Name \nSystem (DNS) queries. Such modifications serve malicious activities,\
    \ such as phishing, but are used \nby ISPs to redirect the user’s web traffic\
    \ to its servers in order to collect statistics, serve \nadvertisements and other\
    \ purposes. It can further be used by DNS service providers to censor the \naccess\
    \ to a given domain.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n131 \nSome\
    \ authors have argued that it is necessary to be careful with the use of \nactive\
    \ defense as a strategy (OVERILL, 2004; DEWAR, 2014). Dewar (2014) con-\nsiders\
    \ that it necessarily includes action beyond the defender’s immediate network\
    \ \n(through hacking back or surveillance). But even if it does not include such\
    \ an \noption, it still involves the use of ‘security through obscurity’ measures,\
    \ which, \naccording to Anderson’s (2001) may have some serious economic consequences,\
    \ \nnot only by constituting deliberated means of entrenching monopolies, but\
    \ also by \nmaking it harder to distinguish between good and bad products, due\
    \ to the little \ninformation available about their design.  \nDewar (2014) notes\
    \ that given cyberspace’s interconnectedness, problems \ninvolving the dubious\
    \ legality of private companies’ and state actors’ actions in \nmeasures undertaken\
    \ outside the victim’s network may become exacerbated if they \noccur extra-territorially.\
    \ He notes that, as a security paradigm, active defense \nemploys two methods:\
    \ a real-time, identification and mitigation of threats in \ndefenders’ networks\
    \ and a capacity to take external, offensive countermeasures. \nThe paradigm of\
    \ active defense authorizes the adoption of security measures \nas a form of risk\
    \ anticipation. This happens not only through least invasive methods, \nlike ‘security\
    \ through obscurity,’ but also fundamentally through threat intelligence \nand\
    \ hack backs. The basic of threat intelligence suggests that operation centers\
    \ act \nexclusively within the victim’s network and that it happens only in the\
    \ event of an \nattack, and involves exclusively threat behavior analysis. This\
    \ isn’t necessarily \nfalse. But it can be only a part of the story.  \nIf attackers’\
    \ means and motivations are so diverse as companies and \ngovernments stress,\
    \ resting within the environment of a potential victim won’t \nsuffice to prevent\
    \ the next attack from happening, nor provide an adequate level of \nintelligence\
    \ to cast away the possibility of a new attack. A more invasive \ninvestigation\
    \ will eventually be required.  \nThis leads to a correlated issue to active defense:\
    \ its use as a veiled \njustification for offensive measures. In practice, the\
    \ limit between active defense \nand offensive approaches is very thin. The work\
    \ has categorized as offensive only \nthose approaches from companies which openly\
    \ characterized them as such. In this \nvein, cyber operations and surveillance\
    \ platforms were the most common solutions \nwithin offensive cyber security.\
    \ \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n132 \n The paradigm of anticipatory\
    \ security through active defense seems to be \nrooted on a utopic dream of operating\
    \ in a cyberspace free from the risk of physical \nand digital harms. But, contradictorily,\
    \ this paradigm has to recognize that \ncyberspace, computer systems and networks,\
    \ and everything related are inherently \nrisky, so the best one could do would\
    \ be to try to anticipate to risks. It is almost as \nif one could conceive of\
    \ security while aiming for a social world free of any \nviolence.  \nThis utopic,\
    \ contradictory paradigm influences the form that security takes. It \nis not\
    \ so much an objective condition characterized by the absence of dangers, as it\
    \ \nis an attempt to exert control over certain kinds of fluxes. To feed the utopia\
    \ of a \nriskless cyberspace, anticipatory security invokes every form of control\
    \ available, \nprevention included. It escapes market’s and technical considerations\
    \ to become an \nend in itself. It urges for total surveillance to keep citizens\
    \ safe, because cyberspace \nis inherently dangerous and favors criminals and\
    \ terrorists. Any attempt to control \nbad fluxes can be validated, and the reach\
    \ of ‘security’ keeps expanding. And it is \nimportant to be careful with an uncontrolled\
    \ expansion of the concept of security, \nbecause this powerful concept has been\
    \ used to justify and suspend civil liberties, \nauthorize war-making and massively\
    \ reallocate resources to the sector being \nthreatened and to all those actors\
    \ who profit from it.  \n \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n \n\
    6. Concluding thoughts  \nThe cyber security market is a complex arrangement where\
    \ collectivities, in \nthe form of corporations, interact with governments and\
    \ individuals. It has existed \nalmost in consonance with the diffusion of ICTs\
    \ beyond the scope of academic and \nmilitary research, and gained considerable\
    \ strength since policy-makers realized the \npossibilities and risks of ICTs.\
    \ Part of the literature has turned its attention to the \nillegal market operating\
    \ underneath the legitimate cyber security market (ABLON \net al., 2014; FIDLER,\
    \ 2014) and the ‘gray’ market, characterized by legal business \ntransactions\
    \ between private companies and governments (FIDLER, 2014). Legal \nand illegal,\
    \ legitimate or illegitimate, each specter of the market operates in \naccordance\
    \ with its own dynamics, but all are backed by an economic logic and \nsustained\
    \ by a necessary technical expertise.  \nSince the Morris worm77, much has changed\
    \ in the universe of computer \nsecurity. The notion of the virtual space as an\
    \ intrinsically insecure environment \nbecame pervasive in the technical and political\
    \ accounts of the impacts of ICTs in \ngovernments’ and private actors’ daily\
    \ lives (CSTB, 1991; CSIS, 2008). And in \nboth the political discourse and on\
    \ the products and solutions offered by private \ncompanies, the term “cyber security”\
    \ came to replace its old-fashioned, technical, \ncousin “computer security.”\
    \      \nSecurity in cyberspace has become a profitable business. Struggles in\
    \ this \nchamp fuel a multi-billionaire market by increasing the number of perceived\
    \ \ninsecurities and generating a demand for the market to supply. The practices\
    \ of \nprivate companies become more present and relevant in this social universe\
    \ to the \npoint that it becomes difficult to disentangle their effects from those\
    \ of other \npractices in the champ. In theory, it is not so complicated to identify\
    \ whether a \npractice is from a think tank or from a government. A policy brief\
    \ is, generally, a \nthink tank practice, while an official speech by the President\
    \ or any given law is a \ngovernment’s practice. In reality, though, a policy\
    \ brief can be very much \ninfluenced by market conditions: to reach the conclusion\
    \ that a certain system has \ninherent flaws or that a security solution, the\
    \ antivirus, for example, is not enough \nto counter newer cyber security risks,\
    \ a think tank needs to consider the state of the \n                         \
    \                                  \n77 The Morris Worm (named after its creator,\
    \ Robert Morris) was one of the first computer worms \ndistributed through the\
    \ Internet and the first to gain the media’s attention.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\
    \ Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n134 \nart of the cyber security market and consider some\
    \ of the same economic \napproaches that market actors make when developing their\
    \ products.  \nThe range of what constitutes a security risk is significantly\
    \ expanded, some-\ntimes more at the expense of fear than of actual events (BRITO;\
    \ WATKINS, 2011). \nTechnical risks are combined with risks to security, as is\
    \ the case of arguments \nabout the security risks of the theft of intellectual\
    \ property, that marry economics \nand national security (CSIS, 2008; DENARDIS,\
    \ 2014).  \nEarly cyber security companies, mostly antivirus companies, were born\
    \ to \naddress the risks posed by computer worms and viruses. As a response to\
    \ this \nevolving technology, malicious codes became increasingly sophisticated.\
    \ \nAdditionally, with the expansion of the Internet to far beyond its original\
    \ capacity78 \nand with the expansion of mobile connectivity, new categories of\
    \ risks began to \nappear, at the same time that the impacts of previous, existent\
    \ threats, could have a \nlarger reach. What is elusive in this small story about\
    \ how companies began to \naddress cyber security problems is the dimension the\
    \ service has acquired when the \ndebate entered policy circles (see DUNN CAVELTY,\
    \ 2008).  \nAnchored on reports such as the CSTB’s and others, politicians’ and\
    \ security \nexperts’ awareness of cyber risks increased and, thus, they started\
    \ taking preventive \nand precautionary measures against real events and events\
    \ in potential (see CSTB, \n1991; ARQUILLA; RONFELDT, 1993). The political hype\
    \ over cyber security \ncalled for increased budgetary investments to improve\
    \ the resilience of the \ngovernment and private sector’s networks, on the one\
    \ hand, and for preventive \nmeasures, on the other. The discourse of prevention\
    \ became particularly prominent \nafter the 09/11 attacks, with the enmeshment\
    \ between counterterrorism and cyber \nsecurity policies (PALLUAULT, 2011; DEIBERT;\
    \ ROHOZINSKI, 2010).   \nThe possibilities for the cyber security market became\
    \ wider: if, initially, \nspecialized companies appeared to address the problems\
    \ posed by computer worms \nand viruses, something strongly anchored on technical\
    \ solutions, the dynamics of \nvirtual risks allowed a broader market to operate,\
    \ something that included these \nprevious players and new players, such as defense\
    \ contractors or companies \n                                                \
    \           \n78 The adoption of the IPv6 protocol to avoid the exhaustion of\
    \ the previous IPv4 indicates the extent \nto which the Internet has been expanded.\
    \ The new protocol will replace IPv4 and allow for 7.9×1028 \nmore internet addresses\
    \ than its predecessor.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n135 \n\
    specialized in cyber security solutions other than antivirus. Cyber security became\
    \ \na matter of protecting infrastructure and governments against terrorism, combating\
    \ \nforeign espionage and preventing cyber-attacks from happening. \nIn this context,\
    \ the rationale of ‘security’ and the participation of the market \nin it are\
    \ correlated. The current paradigm of security invites one to view “security”\
    \ \nas a commodity, a merchandise (GROS, 2012). Under this paradigm, security\
    \ has \ntwo senses: one related to a state of protection and absence of peril,\
    \ and the other \ndesignating the “entirety of the means of effective protection\
    \ for people, the system \nof active threats that makes it possible to avert potential\
    \ disturbances in a continuing \nway” (GROS, 2010:280).  \nWhilst distinct understandings\
    \ of security have been formulated through the \nmodern era (see GROS, 2012),\
    \ the security of the network, which informs cyber \nsecurity, is about securing\
    \ fluxes. The permeability of the machine is viewed as a \nrisk. And the generalized\
    \ interconnection, so constitutive of contemporaneity, fuels \nthe paranoia of\
    \ a planetary catastrophe, extensive to the universe of the networks in \nthe\
    \ form of major disruptions (GROS, 2012). The main concern of this \nconceptualization\
    \ is with assuring the continuity of processes and preventing \ninterruptions\
    \ of any kind – or, at least, continuously work to prevent it. As Gros \n(2012)\
    \ defines, this understanding of security \nIl s’agit cette fois de désigner la\
    \ continuité d’un processus. Ce sens de la sécurité \nalors pourra concerner aussi\
    \ bien des fluxes matériels (numériques, alimentaires, \netc.), qu’il faut accompagner\
    \ a fin d’empêcher les engorgements soudains ou les \ninterruptions brutales (sécurité\
    \ énergétique, routière, alimentaire), ou bien qu’il \ns’agit de trier, sélectionner,\
    \ filtrer, pour interdire d’accès les éléments nocifs \n(sécurité informatique,\
    \ sécurite sanitaire) (GROS, 2012:173). \nUnder the contemporary dynamics of securitization\
    \ of the virtual space, \nimperatives of protection, control and regulation (of\
    \ the flux) take place. And under \nthe imperative of protection are the principles\
    \ of prevention and precaution. These \nprinciples and the ideal of control pursue\
    \ a logic of permanent requests, in contrast \nto the antique ideal of internal\
    \ stability (GROS, 2012). The constant risk of threats, \nmagnified by the inherent\
    \ vulnerabilities of cyberspace, makes cyber security the \n‘good’ one requests\
    \ for, a good that, from the beginning was never truly indivisible \nnor a monopoly\
    \ of the State (DUNN CAVELTY, 2015). In this sense, distinctly \nfrom the security\
    \ of the state, for example, cyber security is somewhat strange to \nPUC-Rio -\
    \ Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n136 \nthe previous logics of war and peace,\
    \ as it is a child of the paradigm of security, \ninstead of war (GROS, 2010;\
    \ 2012). \nCommodified, cyber security fuels and is fueled by a logic of supply\
    \ and \ndemand. As the debate on the IoT highlights, the more people and devices\
    \ get more \nconnected, new forms of system and network exploitation are believed\
    \ to have \ndeeper and far reaching damages. And the more diversified and complex\
    \ the real or \nperceived threats, the more diverse and complex the security solutions\
    \ offered. \nThree consequences arise from this. One is that the strong logic\
    \ of the market, \nimbued in the provision of cyber security, helps establishing\
    \ a ‘culture of fear’ – \nparticularly among government circles, where the concerns\
    \ about cyber-threats are \nthe most intense. A second consequence is that it\
    \ leads to a cost-based \ndifferentiation in the provision of security. And the\
    \ efficacy of such provision is \nalso amenable to the amount of money one can\
    \ pay to have it (GROS, 2012). The \nfree or the most basic versions of products\
    \ offer little to truly protect the user or the \ncompany against the diversity\
    \ of security threats out there in the Internet. To keep \noneself protected,\
    \ one has to acquire sophisticated, but often quite specialized, \nsecurity solutions.\
    \    \nThe third consequence has not been envisaged in Gros’ (2012) analysis and\
    \ \nis a particular outcome of the growing participation of the state in cyber\
    \ security \npolicy making. Because of the peculiar origins of ICTs, the state’s\
    \ involvement in \nthe champ has always required a direct involvement with other\
    \ powerful agents \noperating in it, as is the case of private companies. As the\
    \ work has shown, public-\nprivate partnerships have been invoked in order to\
    \ carry on cyber security policies. \nThe perception, by government circles in\
    \ the U.S., of the operation of ICTs and the \nexpertise about it as roles that\
    \ belong mainly to the private sector, and the insistent \ncalls to secure cyberspace,\
    \ have led to the constitution of a diverse set of public-\nprivate arrangements.\
    \ Some are particularly peaceful. Deibert and Rohozinski \n(2010) argue that,\
    \ in some cases, businesses are forced to comply with \ngovernment’s demands.\
    \ But in some cases, they voluntarily do. And in others, they \neven seek governments\
    \ with specific products and services to sell, and vice-versa. \nWith the latter\
    \ example in mind, it should be noted that a particular security-\noriented arrangement\
    \ involving companies willing to commercialize their technical \nexpertise with\
    \ the security-seeking government, stands out. It is called the cyber \nsecurity\
    \ industrial complex.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n137 \n\
    6.1. \nThe cyber security industrial complex    \nOne immediate consequence of\
    \ pressures to secure the virtual space enabled \nby ICTs has been the constitution\
    \ of a particular arrangement between public enti-\nties and private corporations\
    \ – either traditionally belonging to the field of defense \nor those new, security-oriented,\
    \ companies born with the expansion of information \ntechnologies. This arrangement\
    \ is oriented towards the commercialization of a \nbroad set of products and services\
    \ required by governments, including active-\ndefense solutions, the commercialization\
    \ of zero-day vulnerabilities, and internet \nfiltering and surveillance technologies\
    \ (BRITO; WATKINS, 2011). \nThe cyber security industrial complex is a far reaching\
    \ enmeshment between \nthe public and the private spheres. It encompasses not\
    \ only defense companies that \ntraditionally participated in the previous military-industrial\
    \ complex, but also \nincludes some of the more recent and specialized IT companies\
    \ working with quite \ninnovative cyber security solutions. What is commercialized\
    \ in this burgeoning \nmarket are solutions to cope with terrorism, cyberwar,\
    \ the activities of malicious \nhackers, possible disruptions in critical infrastructure\
    \ and cyber-crime. \nThere is a competition between these distinct groups of firms\
    \ for security \ncontracts with the government, as both IT firms and defense contractors\
    \ see \nopportunities to profit from the cyber business (BRITO; WATKINS, 2011).\
    \ Large \nsecurity vendors, for example, tend to use the acquisition of highly\
    \ specialized start-\nups and smaller companies as a strategy to gain significant\
    \ shares of the market. \nNot only this allows the acquirer a larger market share;\
    \ as it also adds to its services \nportfolio some new, disruptive technologies\
    \ and renovated engineering talent. In \naddition, the acquisition of innovative\
    \ start-ups may expand the ties among the \nprivate sector and the government,\
    \ or even create new ones, as some of the newly \nincorporated companies eventually\
    \ come with an extra bonus: existent contracts \nwith government agencies (DEIBERT,\
    \ 2013). \nIn the context of the cyber security industrial complex, companies\
    \ not only \nserve a market for network attack strategies and surveillance techniques:\
    \ by \nmarketing cyber security solutions and intelligence services to defense\
    \ and \nintelligence agencies, they are also creating a new market and new opportunities\
    \ \n(DEIBERT, 2011). The government’s interest in spending on computer and cyber\
    \ \nsecurity solutions is directly influenced by the way that market actors and\
    \ the \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n138 \nindustry reinforce\
    \ particular frames of cyber threats (BARNARD-WILLS; \nASHENDEN, 2012). One example\
    \ is the perception of an IT market analyst quoted \nin Brito and Watkins (2011):\
    \ “It’s a cyber war and we’re fighting it. In order to fight \nit, you need to\
    \ spend more money, and some of the core beneficiaries of that trend \nwill be\
    \ the security software companies.” (BRITO; WATKINS, 2011:69) \nThe cyber security\
    \ industrial complex holds an intimate relation to processes \nof militarization\
    \ in the West. As U.S. major corporate giants and dozens of niche \nfirms join\
    \ forces to serve the cyber security market, a global, cyber-offensive \noriented\
    \ market flourishes: “there are enormous profits to be made in developing \ncapabilities\
    \ to deny access to knowledge, prevent networks from functioning, or \nsubvert\
    \ them entirely. Fibre-optic surveillance and cyberspace disruption is now \n\
    big business.” (DEIBERT, 2013:398) \nIntelligence-gathering capabilities advertised\
    \ by corporations are as good as, \nor even better than, the government’s. And\
    \ these actors not only design threat \nsignatures, they are also discovering\
    \ (and commercializing) zero day vulnerabilities \n(HARRIS, 2014). Harris (2014)\
    \ contends that some companies today are in position \nto compete with governments\
    \ for the “conduct of hostilities” in cyberspace.  \nThe perverse dynamics of\
    \ the cyber security industrial complex is that it feeds \nitself of a fear-based\
    \ hype and, in turn, sells back to the government some products \nand services\
    \ that have been used to surpass existent regulations and violate online \nprivacy\
    \ (BRITO; WATKINS, 2011; DEIBERT, 2012; 2013; HARRIS, 2014). This \ninstitutional\
    \ arrangement possibly jeopardizes existent attempts to make cyberspace \na more\
    \ secure environment by both employing techniques that explore the systems’ \n\
    and networks’ vulnerabilities in the same fashion that cyber-criminals do and\
    \ by \ncreating a defense-budget dependent constituency with a wide influence\
    \ over \npolicy-making, threat-perceptions and strategic interests (see DEIBERT,\
    \ 2011; \n2013). \nThe existence of the cyber security industrial complex also\
    \ affects the \ndynamics of Internet governance. Currently, there is a consensus\
    \ that it is \ndistributed among numerous stakeholders, which includes governments,\
    \ private \ncompanies, civil society networks and communities of technical experts\
    \ from \nmultiple countries (DEIBERT; ROHOZINSKI, 2010; MUELLER et al., 2013;\
    \ \nDENARDIS, 2014). Technical arrangements are negotiated and established by\
    \ \nprivate corporations and non-governmental entities; and these arrangements\
    \ are, in \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n139 \nDeNardis’ (2014)\
    \ words, arrangements of power. This involves disputes and \ndeliberations over\
    \ how to coordinate, manage and shape the Internet to reflect \nparticular policies.\
    \ Further, the creation and distribution of power among actors in \na network\
    \ is marked more by the constitution of certain “clubs” of governance than \n\
    by an egalitarian form of organization (MUELLER et al., 2013). These alliances\
    \ \nbetween stakeholders grant them a better position to influence technical \n\
    arrangements: “actors positioned more centrally within networks, or who seize\
    \ a \nfirst-mover advantage, may be better able to influence the information flows\
    \ within \nit.” (MUELLER et al., 2013:90). \nCyber security, as a central component\
    \ of Internet governance, responds to \nproblems concerning user’s authentication,\
    \ CIP, cyber-terrorism, malicious codes, \nespionage, denial of service attacks,\
    \ the theft of identity and intellectual property, \nas well as data interception\
    \ and modification (DENARDIS, 2014). By carrying out \nacts of surveillance and\
    \ espionage, acquiring zero-days for exploitation purposes, \ndeveloping “cyber\
    \ arms” and deploying them against state (and possibly non-state) \ntargets, public\
    \ and private actors enmeshed in the cyber security industrial complex \nundermine\
    \ the central components of Internet governance. And, by patronizing new \nmarket\
    \ solutions to some perceived ‘cyber insecurities’, the risk is that private \n\
    companies may be purposely feeding a spiral of loosely grounded fear and \ninsecurity.\
    \  \nIn addition, this complex also brings to the surface concerns with the \n\
    accountability of the parties involved, due to the complicated enmeshment between\
    \ \npublic and private practices. In this context, it becomes tricky to point\
    \ whether a \npractice is accountable to a government or to a contractor. Outsourcing\
    \ is also an \nattempt made by governments to mitigate risks, but the arrangements\
    \ born out of \nthis, particularly when they touch sensitive issues, such as data\
    \ and cyber security, \noften lack transparency (DEIBERT; ROHOZINSKI, 2010). \n\
    As Deibert (2013) notes, it is possible to picture several good reasons for a\
    \ \nburgeoning cyber security market. Among these reasons is the efficiency of\
    \ the \nprivate sector’s response to the constant need to fend off malicious software.\
    \ \nHowever, when market dynamics and the desire of defense and intelligence \n\
    agencies (and some companies) to monitor and “strike back” threats marry, \nperverse\
    \ dynamics are created: “Securing cyberspace is only a part of the cyber \nsecurity\
    \ market: exploiting it, mining it for intelligence, and even propagating \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n140 \nvulnerabilities that undermine and\
    \ destabilize it are quickly becoming just as lucra-\ntive parts of the game.”\
    \ (DEIBERT, 2013:504) \n6.1.1. Cyber insecurity beyond the cyber security industrial\
    \ complex: \ndealing with a multiplicity of public-private arrangements \nThe\
    \ cyber security industrial complex is a phenomenon that has important \nimplications\
    \ for the effective ‘security’ of the Internet. This arrangement is a \nparticular\
    \ result of struggles between agents in the champ of cyber security and, as \n\
    the last section has shown, its role in increasing the overall perception of security\
    \ \nin cyberspace is highly questionable. However, disputes among agents also\
    \ \ngenerate other kinds of public-private arrangements that are not always as\
    \ peaceful \nfor the government-company relations. The cyber security industrial\
    \ complex \ngenerates patterns of cooperation among government and the private\
    \ sector at the \nexpense of the competition between companies to grab a parcel\
    \ of the public-sector \nmarket. This competition has led to the adoption by companies\
    \ of aggressive market \nstrategies to gain more space in it and to commercialize\
    \ specific security solutions, \nwith the market creating some additional needs\
    \ to protect oneself.  \nOther distinct arrangements have generated more conflict\
    \ in the relationship \nbetween government agencies and IT companies than the\
    \ case of the cyber security \nindustrial complex. They often involve less the\
    \ companies working with cyber \nsecurity services and more those companies offering\
    \ a wider range of services, such \nas ISPs, OSPs, banks and even companies within\
    \ the cyber risk assessment \nbusiness. The companies play a less direct role\
    \ in shaping cyber security, but this \nrole is nonetheless crucial to understand\
    \ the dynamics of the production of cyber \nsecurity contemporarily. Whilst these\
    \ companies were not the primary object of the \nresearch, when investigating\
    \ the dynamics of the champ, it became clear that they \nalso played an important\
    \ and central role in it.     \nThe distinction of these companies in relation\
    \ to companies working directly \nwith cyber security is that the impacts of their\
    \ decisions on cyber security is a priori \nless visible. This is because much\
    \ of the impact they have in the production of cyber \nsecurity relates to decisions\
    \ over the development and adoption of certain technical \nstandards in detriment\
    \ of others. This process of development and adoption of \ntechnical standards\
    \ takes into consideration the market strategy of each company. \nApple, for example,\
    \ is a corporation that values the security of its products. Thus, \nPUC-Rio -\
    \ Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n141 \nit comes as no surprise that vulnerabilities\
    \ in the iOS system are the most valuable \nin the exploit market (GREENBERG,\
    \ 2012). Social networks, in turn, have a rele-\nvant part of their revenue coming\
    \ from advertising. The policy of providing \npersonalized adds based on user’s\
    \ preferences is behind the practices of data and \nmeta-data collection developed\
    \ and employed by these companies. The data \ncollected is, in turn, requested\
    \ by governments in many occasions and, more often \nthan not, the companies are\
    \ obliged to comply with governments solicitations.      \nEfforts by the NSA\
    \ to work with IT companies to make products and services \n‘surveillance-friendly’\
    \ also show how much political and economic stakes impact \nthe design and administration\
    \ of technologies. Documents leaked by Edward \nSnowden show that the agency has\
    \ spent about $250 million annually to make \nproducts design exploitable. The\
    \ case of Juniper’s network breach has exposed the \nexistence of encryption backdoors\
    \ authored by government agencies – and the \nextent of the compliance of some\
    \ companies with this policy. \nAs it was observed earlier in the work, the infrastructure\
    \ of this network is \nowned and operated primarily by the private sector. Because\
    \ of their size and of \nuser’s dependence on these companies, the decisions and\
    \ policies adopted by them \nhave consequences for policies of privacy and Internet\
    \ governance. Google, for \nexample, uses lobbying and advocacy activities to\
    \ support or repudiate certain \nlegislations in attempts to shape public policy\
    \ according to its commercial interests \n(see DEIBERT, 2013). \nBy establishing\
    \ technical and architectural standards, social media companies \nwield a growing\
    \ political power (DENARDIS, 2014). But, to the same extent, they \nbecome increasingly\
    \ subject to the assertion of state power in the Internet. Within \ntheir territorial\
    \ jurisdictions, governments tend to enlist or compel the private sector \nto\
    \ police the data they collect and the networks they control and thus empower\
    \ \ncompanies to monitor, filter and control the user’s activities online. An\
    \ immediate \nconsequence of this is allowing the growth of new markets for the\
    \ commercial \nexploitation of data (DEIBERT, 2013). \nAs worrisome as the tendency\
    \ of downloading policing and monitoring \nresponsibilities to the private sector\
    \ may be, this is an issue where disagreements \nbetween private and public agents\
    \ are strong. The conflict between Apple and the \nFBI over the use of backdoors\
    \ to circumvent encryption is a case in point. \nCompanies actively repudiate\
    \ the excessive intervention of the State in the \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital\
    \ Nº 1412452/CA\n142 \noperation of their technologies. The Apple case is particularly\
    \ illustrative because \nthe strength of its operational system has been an important\
    \ part of the company’s \nmarket strategy. Whilst the Apple itself does not deny\
    \ it has complied with FBI’s \ninvestigations on several occasions (see COOK,\
    \ 2016), the FBI’s request was \nviewed as a defiance to the trustfulness of the\
    \ technology that company sells, on \none side, and to user’s privacy, on the\
    \ other. The company’s position in face of the \nrequest granted it the strong\
    \ support of other companies and pro-privacy groups, \nhighlighting the conflict\
    \ of interests that has been constitutive of the U.S. \ngovernment and Silicon\
    \ Valley relationship.     \nCloser to the dynamics of the cyber security industrial\
    \ complex is the relation \nbetween government and telecommunication companies\
    \ and ISPs. The relation \nbetween these agents can be located between the gray\
    \ area of the cyber security \nindustrial complex (because of much of the shared\
    \ dynamics between the \ngovernment and such companies, including cooperation\
    \ for surveillance purposes) \nand other arrangements, particularly because they\
    \ don’t commercialize cyber \ndefensive/offensive solutions directly. A router\
    \ company, like Cisco or Juniper, is \nan Internet chokepoint, a physical point\
    \ through where the data flow is transmitted. \nIn other words, these companies\
    \ control parts of the communication flow in \ncyberspace, they have the power\
    \ to allow and constrain communications, as well as \nto enable or constrain governmental\
    \ surveillance and filtering, which largely \ndepends on the collaboration of\
    \ these companies. Filtering and censorship in non-\ndemocratic countries is a\
    \ practice which is also enabled by companies born in \nconsolidated democracies\
    \ and wanting to expand their businesses elsewhere \n(DEIBERT, 2012; 2013).  \n\
    To summarize, it is possible to note that in these arrangements, private \ncompanies\
    \ produce cyber security differently. Cyber security companies actively \nwork\
    \ with protective and offensive measures in cyberspace, but the social media,\
    \ \ninternet service providers and telecommunication companies shape cyber security\
    \ \nthrough the technical standards they develop and apply in compliance or in\
    \ conflict \nwith government requests. The U.S. government has been particularly\
    \ inclined, \nthrough either friendly cooperation or legal compliance, to use\
    \ the power these \ncompanies have to enforce law and security in cyberspace.\
    \ But the impacts of these \narrangements extend well beyond the universe of U.S.\
    \ Internet users.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n143 \n6.2.\
    \ \nThe global impacts of struggles in the U.S. champ \nAlthough the work considers\
    \ the dynamics of the cyber security champ in the \nU.S., it is naïve to believe\
    \ that the practice of agents, or the effects of these practices, \nare restricted\
    \ to the universe of U.S. politics. In fact, this champ is particularly \nrelevant\
    \ because of the direct and indirect implications that struggles in it have for\
    \ \nhow the Internet is experienced around the world.     \nDomestic political\
    \ systems arbitrate international developments differently. \nThe regulations\
    \ that domestic actors issue have an important role in Internet \ngovernance,\
    \ particularly by allowing or constraining practices of control, filtering \n\
    and surveillance on the Internet (ERIKSSON; GIACOMELLO, 2009). The desire \nto\
    \ expand their business to beyond the U.S. and other occidental markets has led\
    \ \nmany companies to comply with local regulations in several countries with\
    \ diverse \npolitical systems, as non-democratic as they may be.  \nThe case of\
    \ Google subjecting to the Chinese government restrictions and \nfiltering is\
    \ good example, but Google is not alone in this. Companies in the cyber \nsecurity\
    \ industrial complex commercialize surveillance technologies with non-\ndemocratic\
    \ government with far less legal restrictions than they do with the U.S. \ncompanies\
    \ (see DEIBERT, 2013). In face of the possibilities granted by less \ndemocratic\
    \ markets worldwide, the struggle for an effective parcel of a local market \n\
    becomes the struggle for a parcel of the global market of cyber security. \nThis\
    \ may as well create some frictions with the domestic markets to where \nthese\
    \ companies are expanding. In Brazil, for example, it is not unlikely for private\
    \ \nInternet companies, such as Google and Facebook, to refuse to cooperate with\
    \ local \nlaw enforcement agencies because of existent contractual and legal obligations\
    \ in \nthe U.S., where their core services and servers are hosted (DINIZ et al.,\
    \ 2014).  \nAnother aspect of the global effects of the practices in the local,\
    \ U.S. market, \nhas been publicized by Edward Snowden’s revelations about the\
    \ extensive \nsurveillance practices of the NSA. Underlying the actions of the\
    \ intelligence agency \nis a complex set of data collection and monitoring practices\
    \ favored by the will of \nsome companies to commercialize the solutions required\
    \ by the U.S. government, \non the one hand, and by the known or unknown collection\
    \ of the data collected and \nstored by social networks and other online service\
    \ providers, on the other. These \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n\
    144 \npractices reached public authorities worldwide and the population of several\
    \ \ncountries as well.   \nThe competition for a parcel of the market has led\
    \ some companies to expand \nbusinesses beyond their birthplace. The U.S. is still\
    \ a valuable market for cyber \nsecurity and other IT companies, but the Latin-American,\
    \ and South Asian markets \nhave been seen as providers of great opportunities\
    \ as well, according to the Cyber \nSecurity Ventures market analysis (MORGAN,\
    \ 2016). But this expansion has been \nin part driven by the growth of a cyber\
    \ security industrial complex, when cyber \nsecurity companies are concerned,\
    \ and by either the consolidation of public-private \narrangements outside the\
    \ U.S. or by the expansion of U.S. born public-private \narrangements beyond the\
    \ country’s jurisdiction, as in the case of NSA’s mass \nsurveillance. Additionally,\
    \ companies willing to expand businesses that still have \nto observe U.S. regulations\
    \ can originate serious concerns about what end they give \nto user’s data outside\
    \ the country. As Deibert (2013) highlights, much of the data \ncollected abroad\
    \ by these companies is subject to the U.S. Patriot Act, a \ncontroversial antiterrorism\
    \ legislation.  \n6.2.1. Power, security and internet governance \nIn terms of\
    \ Internet governance, the conflictual nature of a large portion of \nthese arrangements\
    \ between governments and private actors suggests that, in the \nlong term, none\
    \ of them will actually control the Internet. A “complex pattern of \noverlapping\
    \ governance structures”, in Dunn Cavelty’s (2009b:214) words, still \nprevails.\
    \ These structures stem from diverse actors and their different approaches \n\
    to the Internet, as well as from the power struggles among them.            \n\
    Currently, it is agreed that the Internet is best governed through a multi-stake-\n\
    holder approach79 (see RENDA, 2013; CONTRERAS et al., 2013; COMNINOS, \n2013).\
    \ Issues about the governance of the Internet go beyond the policies and laws\
    \ \nenacted by governments’ actors, as they involve concerns with the technical\
    \ design, \ncorporate policies and the role of global institutions in establishing\
    \ them \n(CONTRERAS et al., 2013; DENARDIS, 2014). In this sense, what is said\
    \ and \n                                                           \n79 The multi-stakeholder\
    \ model is informed by a consensual, bottom-up, decision making process \nover\
    \ the Internet Domain System involving distinct, interested parties, which includes\
    \ businesses, \ntechnical experts, the civil society and governments.   \nPUC-Rio\
    \ - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n145 \ndone on behalf of cyber security\
    \ is relevant for how internet governance is \nunderstood and conduced in practice,\
    \ as cyber security measures are established by \nboth technical specificities\
    \ and corporate policies. The increased securitization of \ncyberspace is an important\
    \ factor shaping today’s global communications and it \nmay jeopardize the way\
    \ the Internet is experienced by distinct stakeholders – the \ncivil society included\
    \ – as certain issues regarding information security and the \ngovernance of the\
    \ Internet (for example, the debates about encryption and Internet \ncontrol)\
    \ are also securitized and transformed into national security concerns \n(COMNINOS,\
    \ 2013). The relation between Internet governance and cyber security \nbecomes\
    \ quite clear in Renda’s (2013) question over whether the Internet should \nremain\
    \ an end-to-end, neutral environment, or if Internet freedom should be \nsacrificed\
    \ in the name of security. \nAccording to Nye (2014), Internet governance faces\
    \ many areas of public and \nprivate decision-making. While technical standards\
    \ related to the Internet protocol \nare set by engineers involved in non-governmental\
    \ and non-profit, private entities, \nthe determination as to which of these standards\
    \ will be applied “depends upon \nprivate corporate decisions about their inclusion\
    \ in commercial products” (NYE, \n2014:5). At the same time, the increased involvement\
    \ of the state in matters of \nInternet security and governance is associated\
    \ with the growing pressures to make \ncyberspace secure, while cybercrime is\
    \ believed to encourage the involvement of \nprivate companies in cyber security\
    \ (NYE, 2014; DEIBERT; ROHOZINSKI, \n2010). \nBecause of the complex pattern of\
    \ governance structures that constitute \nInternet governance, private companies\
    \ can be as powerful as governments in this \narena. But their power is exercised\
    \ in distinct ways, through the maintenance of the \nownership and operation of\
    \ material and virtual infrastructures, through the \ndefinition of technical\
    \ standards or through direct commercializing cyber security \nsolutions with\
    \ governments. As Nye (2011) argues, the power over information \nflows is distributed\
    \ and agents have distinct resources of power at their disposal. \nOn one side,\
    \ companies themselves produce cyber security. Banks develop \ncomplex anti-fraud\
    \ and anti-theft systems to protect their internal networks and \ncustomer’s transactions,\
    \ while telecommunication companies implement their own \nsecurity measures to\
    \ protect infrastructure (HARRIS, 2014); software developers \ninvest in technologies\
    \ that protect the data of their users, social networks establish \nPUC-Rio -\
    \ Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n146 \ntheir own privacy and user policies\
    \ while cyber risk assessment companies help in \nshaping perceptions of security\
    \ and insecurity in the market by analyzing what \nconstitutes a security threat\
    \ to their commercial and government clients. These \ncompanies may willingly\
    \ or unwillingly attend a state request for the control and \nfiltering of a content\
    \ or very much comply with surveillance practices. \nOn the other side, some companies\
    \ are willing to offer what the government \nwants – and create some additional\
    \ needs. They provide cyber defensive and even \ncyber offensive solutions for\
    \ government agencies and other companies anxious to \navoid unwanted intrusions,\
    \ that could possibly culminate in the theft of vital infor-\nmation, in their\
    \ networks. These companies answer to a growing demand for a \n“secure” cyberspace\
    \ at the same time they have the power to indicate, themselves, \nwhat can constitute\
    \ a cyber security threat. \nIn this way, it is necessary to pay attention to\
    \ the way the cyber security \nindustrial complex poses specific challenges to\
    \ the governance of the Internet, as it \npulls the balance of power towards a\
    \ more ‘centralized’ arrangement between \ngovernment and private companies. The\
    \ increased development of surveillance \ntechnologies, together with offensive\
    \ and defensive cyber weapons, means that \ncompanies are working on new tools\
    \ to search and store data, to follow real-time \nmovements through geolocalization\
    \ features. And, in some countries, the use of \nthese technologies may help introducing,\
    \ legitimizing and normalizing practices of \ncensorship.   \nWhat is elusive\
    \ in the struggles over cyber security is the very logic of \nsecurity that is\
    \ applied to them. To keep questioning if it is the government or other \nkinds\
    \ of actors the one who controls the Internet (see ERIKSSON; GIACOMELLO, \n2009)\
    \ may help in understanding to what side of the balance the power struggles \n\
    for the Internet are pending, but it does little to understand the weight of cyber\
    \ \nsecurity for the governance of Internet and how agents shape it with their\
    \ practices, \nsomething that directly influences how users experience it. The\
    \ prevailing logic of \nsecurity works on the basis of constructing a division\
    \ over what is safe and what \nstays at the margins – the black markets, the criminals,\
    \ the rogue. This working \nlegitimizes practices of ‘legit’ agents in the champ\
    \ – the state, private companies – \nto the detriment of illegitimate practices\
    \ of the wrongdoers, even when the former \npractices are similar to the latter.\
    \ The exploitation of vulnerabilities is illustrative \nof this argument. According\
    \ to this logic, security is less about guaranties and more \nPUC-Rio - Certificação\

    \ a threat. The logic of the \npermanent evaluation, in turn, may cast legal guaranties\
    \ and rights aside when the \nimminent and constant threat is concerned.  \nFurther,\
    \ the role of states and private companies in cyber security indicates \nthat\
    \ more cyber security does not necessarily equate to a better way to counter cyber\
    \ \nthreats and surveillance. As Comninos and Seneque (2014) argue, the current\
    \ cyber \nsecurity discourse has been dominated by a focus of states and corporations\
    \ on their \nown security rather than on the security of Internet users and the\
    \ civil society. This \napproach to cyber security may, in turn, cast balance\
    \ of power and most pressing \ndecisions pertaining Internet governance away from\
    \ civil society and the Internet \nusers’ interests. \nUnlike computer security,\
    \ much of what is understood by cyber security to-\nday is not (exclusively) about\
    \ assuring the security and integrity of the system, nor \nthe usability of the\
    \ Internet, but about what results from its promoted marriage with \nconcerns\
    \ regarding CIP, espionage and cyber-terrorism. The tension between what \nis\
    \ done to assure the uninterrupted flow of information versus what is done to\
    \ filter, \ncontrol and interrupt it seems to be constitutive of this marriage,\
    \ and it is carried \nout in the course of the struggles over cyber security.\
    \ One must, however, be \nattentive to the way these struggles and the arrangements\
    \ born out of them have the \npotential to either increase or jeopardize the equilibrium\
    \ between the flow of \ninformation and the freedom and liberty of the everyday\
    \ user, and be particular \nwary of alliances between governments and corporations\
    \ acting on their own \nbehalf. \n6.3. \nWhat form of cyber security is desirable?\
    \ \nIn contrast with other forms of security, cyber security is peculiar because\
    \ of \nits symbiotic relation with the market, since the inception of early information\
    \ and \ncommunication technologies. With the marketization of the Internet, in\
    \ the 1990s, \nthe role of private actors in shaping security in cyberspace, from\
    \ the definition of \ntechnical security standards and requirements to advertised\
    \ cyber security solutions, \nhas become even more fundamental. The close relationship\
    \ between these actors \nand governments, in turn, has become pivotal for the\
    \ establishment of national \nsecurity policies and guidelines concerning cyber\
    \ security.  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n148 \nThe participation\
    \ of private companies in the production of security is a \nconstitutive aspect\
    \ of the predominant neoliberal mode of governance that was \nalready strong in\
    \ the 1970s. For cyber security, the dynamics could not be much \ndifferent: if,\
    \ on the one hand, the champ has a strong participation of private actors \nfrom\
    \ the beginning, on the other hand, it does not escape from much of the \ndilemmas\
    \ posed by this mode of governance – although these dilemmas may gain \na different\
    \ shape in this realm.  \nA first dilemma is about the patterns of the distribution\
    \ of power among a \ndiverse set of private entities. The analysis of the champ\
    \ of cyber security under a \nBourdieusian framework that has been carried out\
    \ in this work has shown that the \nimmediate power over the control of information\
    \ flows is distributed among a \ndiverse group of profit and non-profit private\
    \ actors. The first group was a more \nimmediate focus of the research because\
    \ of the visible economic interests invested \nby them and because of the extent\
    \ to which these interests are relevant for how they \ncontribute to the production\
    \ of security.  \nA more diffused exercise of power by invested actors implicates\
    \ in more \ndiffused options to make them accountable for the power they exercise.\
    \ In most \ncases, IT companies are best held accountable in face of the government\
    \ of the \ncountry in which their servers are located; and their accountability\
    \ in places where \nthey commercialize their services without necessarily having\
    \ a physical \ninfrastructure is at best imperfect, often marked by conflicts\
    \ between their \ncontractual obligations in the host countries versus the legal\
    \ obligations they should \ncomply with in foreign countries. Accountability becomes\
    \ even more difficult in \ncases where private companies orient themselves to\
    \ serve national security \ninterests, as it happens with the cyber industrial\
    \ complex alliance. As this chapter \nhas shown, such marriage between economic\
    \ and security interests can be nothing \nbut worrisome for the way people currently\
    \ experience the Internet.  \nCompanies act first and foremost in accordance with\
    \ their economic interests. \nWhile it is undeniable that the particular constitution\
    \ of IT companies by computer \nexperts and engineers grants their structure more\
    \ flexibility and broader goals in \nsome cases – such as concerns with data privacy,\
    \ the resilience of systems and so \non –, the dynamics of funding and eventual\
    \ arrangements in the structure of most \ncompanies places profit as a first priority.\
    \ But, as an indissociable part of the private \nenterprise nature, some economic\
    \ ends may adjust very awkwardly to actual \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº\
    \ 1412452/CA\n149 \nsecurity problems. With their risk-oriented mindset, so common\
    \ under the current \nparadigm of security (see GROS, 2012), companies define\
    \ security on the basis of \na permanent evaluation rather than in terms of guaranties.\
    \  \nThis evaluation takes into account the most immediate (perceived) threats\
    \ to \nphysical and digital infrastructure that could possibly affect governments\
    \ and com-\npanies – and, by consequence, citizens. The CIP/CIIP arguments, with\
    \ all the fear \nof great disruptions by criminals and terrorists, bring biopolitics\
    \ to the core of cyber \nsecurity and have played an important role in the legitimation\
    \ of cyber security \npolicies (including budgets), in the political sphere. As\
    \ citizens are portrayed as \nbeing threatened by the very risks that haunt companies’\
    \ operations online, cyber \nsecurity becomes an urgent security matter. \nThe\
    \ power exerted by private companies becomes particularly dangerous \nwhen unchecked\
    \ and a-problematically submitted to the security interests of \ngovernments.\
    \ If governments are the ones responsible for making companies \naccountable,\
    \ one has to wonder what happens when their interests converge at the \nexpense\
    \ of the legal guaranties of the citizens. As Gros (2012) has argued, security\
    \ \npolicies are constructed on the basis of a differentiation between what is\
    \ secure and \nwhat remains in the gray area of insecurity, the unsafe. For the\
    \ most part of the time, \nthis is an arbitrary decision or a result of power\
    \ struggles and alliances between \ninvested actors.  \nNo wonder why some authors\
    \ have been emphasizing the importance of \nadopting a “distributed approach”\
    \ to cyberspace security (DEIBERT, 2012; 2013).  \nThey are worried with the possible\
    \ implications of the arrangements that have been \nconstituted as a result of\
    \ the cyber security hype. A distributed approach is anchored \non the notion\
    \ that it is necessary to check the concentration of power domestically, \nin\
    \ order to increase the trustfulness of a political entity internationally. It\
    \ involves \nthe combination of multiple actors with shared governance roles and\
    \ \nresponsibilities in such a way that none of these actors may effectively control\
    \ \ncyberspace without cooperating with the others. This involves the participation\
    \ not \nonly of private companies and governments, but of citizens and the civil\
    \ society as \nwell: “Securing cyberspace requires a reinforcement of, rather\
    \ than relaxation of \nrestraint on power, including checks and balances on governments,\
    \ law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies as well as the private sector.”\
    \ (DEIBERT, \n2012:273).  \nPUC-Rio - Certificação Digital Nº 1412452/CA\n150\
    \ \nRoughly speaking, the participation of citizens in the process of securing\
    \ \ncyberspace has been lacking in much of current cyberspace governance. It is\
    \ almost \nderisive. The civil society has made itself more present in the virtual\
    \ universe, but \nthe individual itself is still viewed as a mere user, due to\
    \ the lack of technical \nexpertise, which has been pointed in chapter one as\
    \ a sine qua non condition to \nenter disputes in the champ of cyber security.\
    \ This is a barrier that makes \ncyberspace less democratic and places the burden\
    \ of cyber insecurity at the \nshoulders of the end-user, which rests powerless\
    \ to decide important aspects of \nsecurity and governance at the same time it\
    \ is directly affected by the dynamics of \nstruggles in the champ.     \n \n\

    ABSTRACT \nTo meet the growing food demand, agricultural businesses are turning\
    \ to the Internet of things for analytics and \ngreater production capabilities.\
    \ The Internet of things (IoT) is essentially making “dumb” things “smart” by\
    \ \nconnecting them to each other and to the Internet. Farmers are turning to\
    \ IoT solutions to increase efficiencies \nand yields and reduce loss and waste.\
    \ In an agricultural context, IoT refers to the use of sensors, cameras, and \n\
    other devices to turn every element and action involved in farming into data.\
    \  IoT is poised to push the future \nof agriculture to the next level. In this\
    \ paper, we will explore various applications of IoT in agriculture and \nexamine\
    \ their benefits and challenges. \n \nKeywords: internet of things; agriculture;\
    \ smart farming; precision agriculture\n \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture is a big\
    \ business. It is a form of manufacturing, \nheavily capital intensive. It plays\
    \ a vital role in any nation’s \neconomy. Today’s agricultural businesses must\
    \ contend \nwith issues like population growth, workforce impact from \npandemics,\
    \ financial upheaval, unpredictable climate \nconditions, increasing water shortages,\
    \ shrinking arable \nland, limited availability of natural resources, and \nfluctuating\
    \ costs. To accommodate the needs of the growing \npopulation, the agriculture\
    \ industry needs to adopt new \ntechnologies. The demand can be successfully met\
    \ with IoT.  \nIoT applications are focused on helping farmers close the \nfood\
    \ supply demand gap by ensuring high yields, \nprofitability, and protection of\
    \ the environment. \n \nThe Internet of things (IoT) allows all entities to be\
    \ \nconnected to each other through wired or wireless \ncommunication means. IoT\
    \ means physical devices are \nconnected so that they can send and receive information\
    \ \nvia the Internet.  IoT has been gaining popularity rapidly \nsince its inception\
    \ into the IT world and is being used in \nhealthcare, education, gaming, finance,\
    \ transportation, \nagriculture, etc. [1]. Agriculture employs IoT through the\
    \ \nuse of robots, drones, sensors, and computer imaging   \nVarious innovative\
    \ uses of IoT applications in agriculture \nare driving opportunities for increase\
    \ yields while \nimproving food safety and delivery.  \n \nOVERVIEW ON INTERNET\
    \ OF THINGS  \nInternet of things (IoT) is a worldwide network that \nconnects\
    \ devices to the Internet and to each other using \nwired or wireless technology.\
    \ IoT is expanding rapidly and \nit has been estimated that 50 billion devices\
    \ will be \nconnected to the Internet by 2020.  These include smart  \n \nphones,\
    \ tablets, desktop computers, autonomous vehicles, \nrefrigerators, toasters,\
    \ thermostats, cameras, pet monitors, \nalarm systems, home appliances, insulin\
    \ pumps, industrial \nmachines, intelligent wheelchairs, wireless sensors, \n\
    mobile robots, etc. \n \nThere are four main technologies that enable IoT [2]:\
    \ \n \n1) Radio-frequency identification (RFID) and near-field \ncommunication.\
    \ \n2) Optical tags and quick response codes; this is used for \nlow cost tagging.\
    \ \n3) Bluetooth low energy (BLE). \n4) Wireless sensor network. \n \nOther related\
    \ technologies are cloud computing, machine \nlearning, and big data. \n \nThe\
    \ Internet of things (IoT) technology enables people and \nobjects to interact\
    \ with each other. It is employed in many \nareas such as smart transportation,\
    \ smart cities, smart \nenergy, emergency services, healthcare, data security,\
    \ \nindustrial control, logistics, retails, structural health, traffic \ncongestion,\
    \ manufacturing, industry, security, agriculture, \nenvironment, and waste management.\
    \ \n \nIoT supports many input-output devices such as camera, \nmicrophone, keyboard,\
    \ speaker, displays, microcontrollers, \nand transceivers.  It is the most promising\
    \ trend in the \nhealthcare industry. This rapidly proliferating collection of\
    \ \nInternet-connected devices has the potential to connect \npatients and their\
    \ providers in a unique way. As IoT \ndepends on sensor massive data collections\
    \ to be able \npredict accurate results [3].\nInternational Journal of Scientific\

    \ version of IoT is known as narrowband \nIoT (NBIoT). This is an attractive technology\
    \ for many \nsectors because it has been standardized [4]. The main \nfeature\
    \ of NBIoT is that it can be easily deployed within \nthe current cellular infrastructure\
    \ with a software \nupgrade. \n \nIoT has found several applications in transportation,\
    \ \nenvironmental \nmonitoring, \nforecasting, \nagriculture, \nhealthcare, security,\
    \ and energy conservation   IoT in \nagriculture uses robots, drones, remote sensors,\
    \ and \ncomputer imaging combined with continuously progressing \nmachine learning\
    \ and analytical tools for monitoring crops.  \nTo ensure food safety, data-driven\
    \ solutions enabled by the \nInternet of Things will allow consumers to track\
    \ and \nmonitor produce from farm to fork. \n \nINDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS\
    \ (IOT) \nWhile the IoT affects among others transportation, \nhealthcare, or\
    \ smart homes, the Industrial Internet of Things \n(IIoT) refers in particular\
    \ to industrial environments. IIoT is \na new industrial ecosystem that combines\
    \ intelligent and \nautonomous machines, advanced predictive analytics, and \n\
    machine-human collaboration to improve productivity, \nefficiency and reliability.\
    \ It is bringing about a world where \nsmart, connected embedded systems and products\
    \ operate \nas part of larger systems. \n \nIIoT is often used in the context\
    \ of Industry 4.0, the \nIndustrial Internet and related initiatives across the\
    \ globe. \nIndustry 4.0 describes a new industrial revolution with a \nfocus on\
    \ automation, innovation, data, cyber-physical \nsystems, processes, and people.\
    \ With Industry 4.0, the \nfourth industrial revolution is set on merging automation\
    \ \nand information domains into the industrial Internet of \nthings, \nservices,\
    \ \nand \npeople. \nThe \ncommunication \ninfrastructure of Industry 4.0 allows\
    \ devices to be \naccessible in barrier-free manner in the industrial Internet\
    \ \nof things, without sacrificing safety and security [5]. \n \nThe industrial\
    \ Internet of things (IIoT) refers to the \napplication of the Internet of things\
    \ (IoT)   across several \nindustries such as manufacturing, logistics, oil and\
    \ gas, \ntransportation, energy/utilities, chemical, agriculture, and \nother\
    \ industrial sectors. IIoT has been a driving force \nbehind increased agricultural\
    \ production at a lower cost.  \nThe introduction of IIoT in agriculture involves\
    \ using more \nadvanced sensors in every step of the farming process. \n \nAPPLICATIONS\
    \  \nInternet of things has brought huge benefits like efficient \nuse of water,\
    \ optimization of inputs and many more. IoT \napplications in agriculture include\
    \ livestock monitoring, \nsmart farming, precision farming, smart greenhouses,\
    \ \nagricultural drones.  These applications are illustrated in \nFIGURE 1 [6]\
    \ and discussed as follows [7,8] \n \n• Smart Farming \nSmart farming refers to\
    \ the adoption of information and \ncommunications technologies to enhance and\
    \ automate \nagricultural processes and operations. It is a farming \nmanagement\
    \ concept that involves using modern technology \nto increase the quantity and\
    \ quality of agricultural products.  \nIt is a capital-intensive and hi-tech system\
    \ of growing food \ncleanly and sustainable for the masses. It is essentially\
    \ the \napplication of modern ICT (information and communication \ntechnologies)\
    \ into agriculture. IoT-based smart farming can \nmonitor the agricultural land\
    \ with the help of sensors. It \nenables growers and farmers to reduce waste and\
    \ enhance \nproductivity. It depends largely on IoT thereby eliminating \nthe\
    \ need of physical work of farmers. IoT based smart farming \nimproves the entire\
    \ agriculture system by monitoring the \nfield in real-time and provide more efficient\
    \ water usage.  \n It helps farmers improve yields by increasing productivity\
    \ \nand operational efficiency [9]. Smart farming has two \ncomponents: (1) AgriTech,\
    \ which is a software that is \ncreated for the improvement of some farming processes;\
    \ (2) \nSmart agriculture, which refers to the application of the IoT \nand various\
    \ devices connected to each other.  \n \n• Smart Greenhouses \nGreenhouse farming\
    \ may be regarded as the oldest form of \nsmart farming.  It helps in enhancing\
    \ the yield of vegetables, \nfruits, crops, etc. Traditionally, farmers use manual\
    \ \nintervention to control the greenhouse environment. \nManual intervention\
    \ results in production loss, energy loss, \nand labor costs. A smart greenhouse\
    \ is designed with the \nhelp of IoT to intelligently monitor and control the\
    \ climate, \neliminating the need for manual intervention.  It leverages \nthe\
    \ IoT-connected devices to create a self-regulating \nmicroclimate conducive to\
    \ crop production. The IoT sensors \nin the greenhouse provide accurate real-time\
    \ information \nabout the greenhouse conditions such as lighting, soil \ncondition,\
    \ pressure, humidity, and temperature. \n \n• Smart Irrigation \nThe irrigation\
    \ sector has undergone a remarkable \ntransformation in recent decades due to\
    \ the application of \npressurized water distribution technologies.  Insufficient\
    \ \nand excessive levels of water can harm plants. The \ntraditional irrigation\
    \ system is under pressure due to the \ngrowing water shortages, which are mainly\
    \ caused by \npopulation growth and climate change. The control of water \nresources\
    \ to increase the allocation of retained water is \nimportant.  IoT-equipped irrigation\
    \ systems conserve water \nand ensure that crops are getting just the right amount\
    \ of \nwater.  IoT solutions provide just the right amount of \nirrigation and\
    \ when they should be irrigating [10]. \n \n• Precision Farming \nThis is also\
    \ known as precision agriculture. It can be \nregarded of as anything that makes\
    \ farming practice more \ncontrolled and accurate. It is the most common application\
    \ \nof IoT in the agricultural sector. It is about providing more \naccurate farming\
    \ techniques for planting and growing \ncrops. It is the use of information and\
    \ communication \ntechnology (ICT) along with best agricultural practices.  It\
    \ \nmay boost agricultural production while reducing harmful \nimpact on the environment.\
    \ It can make a big difference to \nfood production facing the challenge of a\
    \ rising world \npopulation.  Precision agriculture provides farmers with \nsuch\
    \ concrete information that enables them to make \ninformed decisions. In precision\
    \ agriculture, drones are \nused in various ways from soil and crop field analysis\
    \ to \nplanting and pesticide spraying [11]. \n \n• Agricultural Drones \nAgriculture\
    \ is one of the major industries to incorporate \ndrones in order to enhance various\
    \ agricultural practices. \nAlso known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones\
    \ \nare better equipped than airplanes and satellites to collect \nagricultural\
    \ data. Drones are being used in agriculture to \nenhance various agricultural\
    \ practices: crop health \nassessment, irrigation, crop monitoring, crop spraying,\
    \ \nplanting, and soil and field analysis. They have become an \ninvaluable tool\
    \ for farmers to survey their lands, perform \nfield analysis, and generate real-time\
    \ data. Drones can spray \nfertilizer 40 times faster than doing it manually.\
    \  FIGURE 2 \nshows a typical agriculture drone [12]. \n \n• Livestock Monitoring\
    \ \nFarm productivity depends on keeping crops and livestock \nhealthy around\
    \ the clock. IoT solutions can help farmers to \ncollect data regarding the location,\
    \ well-being, and health of \ntheir cattle. They can help farmers monitor with\
    \ innovative \nsolutions that lead to actionable and data-driven insights. \n\

    \ \n \n \nIoT devices support crop and livestock health through \nsensor-based\
    \ monitoring and alerts. Wireless IoT can be \nused to collect data regarding\
    \ the location, well-being, and \nhealth of their cattle. Farmers can use their\
    \ smartphones to \nremotely monitor their equipment, crops, and livestock.  \n\
    FIGURE 3 depicts livestock monitoring [13]. \n \n• Weather Forecasting \nWeather\
    \ is a paramount factor in agriculture industry. \nForecasting and monitoring\
    \ of weather conditions empower \nfarmers with information that can guide them\
    \ during \nplanting, harvesting, and other related activities.  Therefore, \n\
    weather condition must be accurately predicted so as to \ncarry out production\
    \ activities. Weather forecasting can be \ndone through analysis of weather data\
    \ over long periods.  \nTemperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture\
    \ \ncan be monitored through various sensors [14]. \n \nOther applications of\
    \ IoT in agriculture include connected \nfarming,  autonomous farm vehicles, agricultural\
    \ drones, \ncrop management, predictive analytics, asset tracking, \nsmart waste\
    \ management, and crop management. \n \nBENEFITS  \nUtilizing the IoT in agriculture\
    \ is undeniably the smartest \nway to feed humanity. IoT has brought huge benefits\
    \ like \nefficient use of water, optimization of inputs, decrease in \ncosts,\
    \ increase in yields, and improve farmer's decision \nmaking with accurate data.\
    \ It can make agricultural \nprocesses more efficient by reducing human intervention\
    \ \nthrough automation. \n \nIt has also reduced the wasteful use of resources\
    \ such as \nwater and electricity. Agriculture IoT has a unique \nopportunity\
    \ to build connected agricultural solutions that \ncan lead to improved yields,\
    \ reduced costs, and a well-fed \nworld. \n \nOther benefits of adopting Internet\
    \ of things in agriculture \ninclude [12]:  \n• \nData collected by smart agriculture\
    \ sensors can be used \nto track the state of your business. \n• \nBetter control\
    \ over the internal processes and lower \nproduction risks. \n• \nCost management\
    \ and waste reduction  \n• \nIncreased business efficiency through process automation\
    \ \n• \nEnhanced product quality and volumes \n• \nReduction of risks \n• \nProducts\
    \ of high quality \n• \nHigh adoption costs \n• \nImprovement in use efficiency\
    \ of inputs (soil, water, \nfertilizers, pesticides, etc,)  \n• \nReduced cost\
    \ of production \n• \nProtection of the environment  \n \nCHALLENGES \nPositioning\
    \ the sensor for an optimal communication path \nis an engineering challenge.\
    \ Other Challenges that slow the \nmass adoption of IoT in agriculture include\
    \ [15]. \n• \nHigh capital investment is needed to implement and \nmaintain IoT\
    \ systems \n• \nPoor coverage and connectivity in rural areas across \nthe globe\
    \ \n• \nData security breaches and privacy \n• \nIoT devices are easy to hack\
    \ and compromise \n• \nFragmented market of small individual players \n• \nIncreased\
    \ cybersecurity risk \n• \nAnalyze large scale unstructured data \n• \nCrop management\
    \ \n• \nFear of new technology \n• \nTechnology is in its infancy \n• \nFear of\
    \ new technology \nSome of these challenges are illustrated in FIGURE 4 [16].\
    \ \nGLOBAL AGRICULTURE IOT \nThe global agriculture IoT market is mainly segmented\
    \ on \nthe basis of component (hardware, software, services), \napplication (precision\
    \ farming, smart greenhouse, livestock \nmonitoring, smart irrigation, etc.),\
    \ and geography. The \nhardware segment commanded the largest share of the \n\
    overall agriculture IoT market in 2020. The precision \nfarming segment accounted\
    \ for the largest share of the \noverall agriculture IoT market in 2020. North\
    \ America \ncommanded the largest share of the global agriculture IoT \nmarket\
    \ in 2020. The global agriculture IoT market is \ndominated by few major players:\
    \ Deere and Company (US), \nTrimble Inc. (US), AGCO Corporation (US), Raven Industries\
    \ \n(US), AgJunction (US), Delaval (Sweden), GEA Group \n(Germany), Antelliq (France),\
    \ Ponsse (Finland), and \nKomatsu Forest (Sweden) [17].  We now consider how IoT\
    \ \nis applied in agriculture around the world. \n \n• United States \nJMB North\
    \ America has brought to market an IoT solution \nthat helps ranchers monitor\
    \ pregnant cows that are \npreparing to give birth. John Deere has developed a\
    \ leading \napproach to precision agriculture technology through \nadvanced communications\
    \ and telematics. Through US and \nCanadian facilities, John Deere markets products\
    \ to \napproximately 1,981 dealer locations. Outside the US and \nCanada, John\
    \ Deere agriculture and turf equipment is sold \nto distributors and dealers for\
    \ resale in over 100 countries. \n \n• Europe \nEuropean farmers are already using\
    \ smart agriculture \ntechnologies such as yield monitoring, GNSS technology in\
    \ \nguidance and steering, variable rate application, and crop \nscouting. In\
    \ Europe, large-scale deployments (LSPs) of IoT \nwill be funded by the European\
    \ Commission.  The objective \nof an LSP is to evaluate the usability and usefulness\
    \ of IoT \ntechnologies in agriculture, The European Research and \nInnovation\
    \ agenda includes deployment of IoT to meet the \nreal needs of public authorities,\
    \ citizens, and business [18].  \nThe adoption rate of animal tracking, dairy\
    \ cattle \nmanagement, and other livestock monitoring technologies \nis high in\
    \ Germany.  \n \n• United Kingdom \nThe UK is focusing on changing its agriculture\
    \ IoT \nlandscape by entering into the new era of technological \ndevelopments\
    \ to meet the rising demand for food by a \ngrowing population, rapid changes\
    \ in climate, changing \ndiets, and increasing scarcity of natural resources.\
    \  \n \n• India \nIn India, about 58 percent of the population relies on \nagriculture\
    \ for their livelihood and one-third of the nation’s \ncapital comes from agriculture.\
    \  However, crop diseases are \none of many hurdles’ farmers have to continually\
    \ deal with. \nChange of climate affects the agricultural crops production \n\
    significantly. One approach farmer take in the Indian State \nof Punjab is fighting\
    \ these diseases through the data \ncollected \nby \nIoT-enabled \nremote \nsensors.\
    \ \nThe \nimplementation of IoT in agriculture poses some own \nunique challenges\
    \ in India, especially for farmers who have \nsmall land-holding and are located\
    \ in rural areas.  By \nmonitoring conditions such as humidity, rainfall and \n\
    temperature levels, farmers are able to better determine \ntheir crops susceptibility.\
    \ With India’s population now \nsurpassing a whopping 1.2 billion people, smart\
    \ farming IoT \nsolutions promise to provide greater food-security and \noptimize\
    \ yield for this largely agrarian economy. Data Quest \nIndia reported that there\
    \ is potential for IoT-based \napplications to have a transformational impact\
    \ with regards \nto rural job creation [19].\n218 \nAvailable Online at www.ijscia.com\

    \ is one of the leading companies in \nthe development of agricultural technology.\
    \ MotorLeaf is a \nplatform that uses IoT in agriculture to manage the yield \n\
    and quality of crops. They produce automatic greenhouse \ntechnologies made possible\
    \ by artificial intelligence. This \ntechnology allows farmers to make data-driven\
    \ decisions \nabout how to best grow their crops. The technology has \nbeen produced\
    \ especially for hydroponic greenhouses. \nHydroponics has advantages in many\
    \ respects compared \nto soiled agriculture. Soilless greenhouse does not require\
    \ \nfertilization, spraying, and over-irrigation technology. \n \n• Thailand \n\
    This nation has a plan to develop the country with innovation \nunder the Thailand\
    \ 4.0 policy and new technology for Thai \nagriculture. Most Thai farmers grow\
    \ and export rice for the \nglobal market. However, farmers lack knowledge and\
    \ \ninnovation that is necessary to control the environment. \nTherefore, there\
    \ is the need to develop a prototype for a smart \nfarm system to support local\
    \ Thai farmers.   \n \nCONCLUSION \nThere is real momentum behind IoT technology\
    \ in agriculture \nand farming. Farmers have realized that the IoT is a driving\
    \ \nforce for increasing agricultural production in a cost-effective \nway. From\
    \ farm to fork, IoT technologies can transform \nagriculture sector by contributing\
    \ to food safety and reducing \nfood waste. IoT applications are enabling farmers\
    \ to collect \ndata that is essential to maintain better farm practices and \n\
    enhance their business’s growth. More information on IoT in \nagriculture or farming\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications
    Of Text-T... Mijat Kustudic and 1 more April 02, 2024 SORA is a text-to-video
    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding

    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and

    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously

    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware

    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,

    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    \ in the 21st century depends on the compatibility of artificial and natural \n\
    complex systems such as the hydrological cycle and urban water systems (Beck et\
    \ al., 2010), \nnatural energy sources and renewable energy systems, climate extremes\
    \ and disaster mitigation \n(Ewing and Demir, 2021), and the agricultural supply\
    \ chain and resilient infrastructures (Alabbad \net al., 2021). More compatible\
    \ natural and artificial system integration is possible by making more \nmeasurements\
    \ about natural systems, obtaining more data (Muste et al., 2017), and using these\
    \ \ndata for the development of artificial systems (Omatu et al., 2015) and digital\
    \ twin environments \n(Sermet and Demir, 2020). This need has increased the importance\
    \ of reliable data and accelerated \ndata processing technology (Hu and Demir,\
    \ 2021). As a result of the rapidly developing \ninformation and communication\
    \ technology approaches in the last two decades, digital \ntransformation has\
    \ accelerated in nearly all sectors (Knell, 2021). Societies' perspectives on\
    \ issues \nsuch as planning, production, and implementation have evolved in parallel\
    \ (Savic, 2021). \nHydrology and water resources domain followed the same trend\
    \ with developments in \nhydroinformatics (Demir et al., 2022). The most notable\
    \ developments can be listed as novel \napplications of deep learning in image\
    \ synthesis and communication (Gautam et al., 2022; Sermet \nand Demir, 2021),\
    \ large scale modeling and analysis on client-side systems (Ewing et al., 2022;\
    \ \nLi et al., 2022), virtual and augmented reality for hydrological education\
    \ and modeling purposes \n(Sermet and Demir, 2022), and novel programming libraries\
    \ and data standards (Ramirez et al., \n2022; Xiang and Demir, 2022). As a natural\
    \ outcome of this rapid digital transformation, the water \nsector has started\
    \ to generate, process, and store more data (Haltas et al., 2021). However, this\
    \ \nprocess has necessitated the reliability, security, and standardization of\
    \ hydrological data because \nreliable data is essential for more accurate hydrological\
    \ forecasts. Similarly, data standardization \nand security are crucial for water\
    \ systems stakeholder engagement in a secure and trustworthy way \n(Voogd et al.,\
    \ 2022). Addressing trust-related concerns has accelerated with the realization\
    \ of the \npotential of blockchain technology. \nBlockchain technology is an advanced\
    \ database mechanism that allows transparent \ninformation sharing within a network\
    \ (Nakamoto, 2008). A blockchain database stores data in \nblocks linked together\
    \ on a chain. The data is chronologically consistent, as it cannot be deleted\
    \ or \nchanged in the chain without consensus on the network. As a result, blockchain\
    \ technology can be \nused to create an immutable ledger to track orders, payments,\
    \ accounts, and other transactions. \nThere are built-in mechanisms in the system\
    \ that prevent unauthorized transaction entries and \ncreate consistency in the\
    \ common viewing of these transactions.  \nBlockchain is a newly emerging technology\
    \ that has been adopted by various sectors in \ninnovative ways and is the subject\
    \ of research and development activities for the last decade. \nBlockchain-based\
    \ energy companies can create a trading platform for the sale of electricity \n\
    between individuals, or homeowners with solar panels can use a similar platform\
    \ to sell excess \nsolar electricity to their neighbors. This process is largely\
    \ automated as smart meters generate \ntransactions, the blockchain records them.\
    \ Likewise, traditional financial systems such as banks \nand stock exchanges\
    \ can use blockchain services to manage online payments, accounts, and stock \n\
    market trading. Also, companies in the media and entertainment industries can\
    \ use blockchain \ntechnology to manage copyrighted data. Similarly, retail companies\
    \ can use the blockchain to track \nmovements of good between suppliers and buyers\
    \ (Akinbi et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Jing et al., \n2021; Li et al., 2022a).\
    \ Blockchain technology has the potential to expand a long-term vision in \nwater\
    \ resource management and has the undeniable promise of decentralized water systems\
    \ as \nwater becomes a sensitive issue around the world. \nAlthough there are\
    \ systematic reviews about the applications of blockchain technology in \nenergy\
    \ markets (Gad et al., 2022), food supply chain (Castellini et al., 2022), the\
    \ health sector \n(Merlo et al., 2023), and the effects of blockchain on business\
    \ in general, there is no comprehensive \nliterature review study on applications\
    \ of the blockchain technology in water resources and \nhydrology. \nThis paper\
    \ presents a systematic review and analysis of hydrological applications within\
    \ the \nscope of blockchain-based technologies. The literature review, which includes\
    \ journal papers, \nconference papers, technical websites, technical project documents,\
    \ and hackathon projects, was \nconducted in detail. Each study is classified\
    \ and evaluated according to the area of hydrology it \nfocuses on, its purpose,\
    \ the level of development of the blockchain application, and the technical \n\
    details it uses when applying blockchain technology. The study aims to explore\
    \ real-time and \npotential application areas of blockchain technology in hydrology\
    \ and water resources \nmanagement. At the same time, it aims to create technical\
    \ guidance on blockchain for all water \nsector stakeholders, examine how blockchain\
    \ technology will provide efficiency and benefits for \nwater resources management,\
    \ and draw the attention of hydroinformatics professionals to new \ngeneration\
    \ data storage and processing algorithms. \n \n1.1. Background on Blockchain Technology\
    \ \nStoring data in distributed ledgers, deciding which data to store with a consensus\
    \ algorithm, \ndefining preconditions with a smart contract, and being able to\
    \ track the recorded data \ntransparently, have been discussed theoretically in\
    \ financial applications since the 1990s, due to \nthe disadvantages of traditional\
    \ data storage systems and the need for reliable third parties in \nfinancial\
    \ transactions (Szabo, 1998). As mentioned before, Bitcoin was the first real-time\
    \ \napplication to record financial transaction data. Although the words \"block\"\
    \ and \"chain\" are always \nmentioned as separate terms in the original bitcoin\
    \ whitepaper, the name of the technology was \nshaped to \"blockchain\" after\
    \ a while (Nakamoto, 2008). The second milestone of blockchain \ntechnology and\
    \ first example of the application of recording transaction data to a database\
    \ only if \nboth parties meet a certain prerequisite, was announced with the Ethereum\
    \ whitepaper (Buterin, \n2014) where the predetermined conditions are called smart\
    \ contracts or chain code.  \nThere are four main types of decentralized or distributed\
    \ networks in the blockchain. Public \nblockchain networks are permissionless\
    \ networks that allow anyone to join. All members of the \nblockchain have equal\
    \ rights to read, edit, and verify the blockchain. Public blockchain networks\
    \ \nare mainly used for trading and mining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum,\
    \ and Litecoin \n(Wang et al., 2022). Private blockchains are controlled by a\
    \ single entity. This authority decides \nwho can become a member and what rights\
    \ the members have in the network. Private blockchains \nare only partially decentralized\
    \ because they contain access restrictions. Hybrid blockchains \ncombine some\
    \ features of both private and public networks. Companies can set up private,\
    \ \npermission-based systems as well as a common system. Thus, they control access\
    \ to certain data \nstored on the blockchain while keeping the rest of the data\
    \ public. They use smart contracts to \nallow members of the partner system to\
    \ check whether private transactions have been completed. \nFor example, hybrid\
    \ blockchains can allow shared access to digital currency, while keeping bank-\n\
    owned currency private. Consortium blockchain networks are managed by a group\
    \ of \norganizations. Pre-selected organizations share responsibility for maintaining\
    \ the continuity of the \nblockchain and determining data access rights. Consortium\
    \ blockchain networks are generally \npreferred in sectors where many organizations\
    \ have a common goal and can benefit from \nresponsibility sharing (Arooj et al.,\
    \ 2022).  \nThe blockchain protocol refers to different types of blockchain platforms\
    \ that can be used for \napplication development purposes. Each blockchain protocol\
    \ adapts fundamental blockchain \nprinciples to suit specific industries or applications.\
    \ The most famous blockchain protocols are \nHyperledger, Ethereum, Corda, and\
    \ Quorum. Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source project with a \nset of tools and\
    \ libraries. In that way, it is possible to customize blockchain applications.\
    \ \nHyperledger Fabric is a modular, general-purpose framework that offers unique\
    \ identity \nmanagement and access control features. Due to these features, it\
    \ is suitable for various usage areas \nsuch as tracking and monitoring of supply\
    \ chains, trade finance, loyalty and reward programs, and \nreconciliation of\
    \ financial assets (Hang and Kim, 2021). Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain\
    \ \nplatform that is useful to build public blockchain applications (Estevam et\
    \ al., 2021). Corda is an \nopen-source blockchain project designed for business.\
    \ Quorum is an open-source blockchain \nprotocol derived from Ethereum. It was\
    \ specifically designed for use in a private blockchain \nnetwork where all nodes\
    \ are owned by only one member or in a consortium blockchain network \nwhere multiple\
    \ members each own a portion of the network (Singh et al., 2022). \nIn summary,\
    \ the main features of blockchain technology that make a difference are described\
    \ \nas follows: Decentralization in blockchain involves the transfer of control\
    \ and decision-making \npowers from a central legal entity (i.e., an individual,\
    \ organization, or group) to a distributed \nnetwork. Decentralized blockchain\
    \ networks use the principle of transparency to reduce the need \nfor trust between\
    \ participants. These networks discourage participants from exercising authority\
    \ \nor control over one another, which reduces the functionality of the network.\
    \ Another main feature \nis immutability, which means that data cannot be changed\
    \ or tampered with once it is stored in the \nblockchain. If a log contains an\
    \ error, you need to add a new transaction to reverse the error, and \nboth transactions\
    \ will be visible on the network. Finally, the consensus mechanism is prominent\
    \ \naspect of a blockchain system, which sets the rules for the consent of the\
    \ participants regarding \nthe recording of transactions. New transactions may\
    \ be recorded only after the majority of the \nparticipants in the network have\
    \ approved them.  \nThe blockchain architecture, on the other hand, includes several\
    \ technical components, which \nare listed as follows: (a) the distributed ledger\
    \ is the shared database used to record transactions in \nthe blockchain network;\
    \ (b) smart contracts are programs that are automatically executed and \nstored\
    \ in the blockchain system when predetermined conditions are met. They run \"\
    if-then\" checks \nso that transactions can be completed safely; and (c) public\
    \ key encryption is a security feature \nthat uniquely identifies participants\
    \ in the blockchain network. This mechanism generates two sets \nof keys for network\
    \ members. One of the keys is a public key that everyone on the network uses \n\
    together. The other key is a private key that is unique to each member. Private\
    \ and public keys \nwork together to unlock the data in the ledger (Figure 1).\
    \ The first generation of blockchain is \nbitcoin and cryptocurrencies; the second\
    \ generation blockchain is smart contracts or chain code; \nand the third generation,\
    \ or future, of blockchain will continue to evolve and grow as companies \ndiscover\
    \ and implement new application areas. The ongoing blockchain revolution continues\
    \ to \noffer limitless potential. \nLike many other industries, the initial ideas\
    \ for the implementation of blockchain in hydrology \nand water resources management\
    \ are mainly focused on the advantages of storing data most \nreliably. Water-related\
    \ data reliability has a key role in water management in all dimensions. Since\
    \ \nwater is a multidimensional natural resource, water resources can be managed\
    \ most effectively by \noptimizing the interests of stakeholders with many different\
    \ priorities. In addition to having \ndifferent priorities regarding the quantity\
    \ and quality of water, there is a social dimension for the \nwater as well. Reliable\
    \ data about shared water resources is essential for the establishment of trust.\
    \ \n(Pahl-Wostl, 2015; Stern and Coleman, 2015). The straightforward guarantee\
    \ of socio-\nhydrological trust and data reliability is made possible by a simply\
    \ distributed digital architecture \nbuilt on blockchain and smart contracts.\
    \  \n \n \nFigure 1. Illustration of basic blockchain architecture \n \nUncertainty\
    \ in multi-stakeholder hydrological systems can be reduced with the assistance\
    \ of \nimmutably recorded data. Likewise, blockchain technology is very suitable\
    \ for applications in the \nfinance of water. Application areas may be the water\
    \ market, where water rights are exchanged, \nor any investment in water management\
    \ and donations to improve water infrastructure or sanitation \nin developing\
    \ countries. In short, it provides the most transparent follow-up of all financial\
    \ \ntransactions in terms of investors or market stakeholders (Wheeler et al.,\
    \ 2014). Similarly, when \nthere is a necessity for the traceability of water,\
    \ blockchain may provide effective solutions. Water-\nrelated traceability will\
    \ be critical for agricultural water management (Yildirim and Demir, 2022), \n\
    water quality and control (Demir et al., 2009), urban water systems, and the water\
    \ footprint of a \nspecial product. \n \n2. Research Methodology \nA systematic\
    \ literature review on blockchain applications in hydrology and water resources\
    \ was \nperformed for this study (Bramer et al., 2018). The literature review\
    \ was initially divided into two \nareas including academic and non-academic use\
    \ cases. The academic literature review includes \njournal and conference papers,\
    \ book chapters, and technical reports. The non-academic literature \nreview includes\
    \ whitepapers, web documents, reports of official institutions, and hackathon\
    \ \nprojects. \nGoogle Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Crossref, Open Alex, Jisc\
    \ Library Hub, and the \nLibrary of Congress were used as academic databases,\
    \ and 25 different keyword combinations \nwere used as a systematic search approach\
    \ (Table A1 in Appendix). After the initial search, the \nresults published before\
    \ 2008 (before the Bitcoin whitepaper) in the database search results were \n\
    eliminated. Later on, results that are indexed in more than one database were\
    \ ultimately removed, \nso that no duplicates remained. There were 5,330 articles\
    \ as a result of the research from these \nstages. These papers were examined\
    \ according to their titles, abstracts, and the content of the paper, \nand classified\
    \ according to their scope of the application. Especially the collections of conference\
    \ \nproceedings with a wide scope were caught by keyword combinations, although\
    \ they did not \ncontain any useful content on blockchain and hydrology. Moreover,\
    \ results containing only one or \ntwo sentences about “blockchain and water”\
    \ were also excluded from the review. It was expected \nthat there would be at\
    \ least a few paragraphs or a section that included useful comments or analysis\
    \ \non the subject matter. \nFor the review of non-academic use cases, hackathon\
    \ projects were retrieved following the \nsame search approach described above,\
    \ using the public projects repository of Devpost (Wang et \nal., 2018). The web\
    \ pages that detail technological content and official reports with digital \n\
    transformation content were manually examined, and a non-academic content list\
    \ that falls under \nthe subject of this study was prepared. Finally, 103 academic\
    \ and 57 non-academic pieces of \ncontent were found directly relevant, and subjected\
    \ to a detailed review. Tables for a detailed \nreview are given as an appendix.\
    \ \nFor the reviewed academic content, several variables and categorization parameters\
    \ were \nselected to evaluate the current maturation process of blockchain technology\
    \ for hydrological \napplications as follows: \nPublication Type: Indicates where\
    \ and in what format academic content is published including \njournal paper,\
    \ conference paper, book, book chapter, thesis, and technical report.  \nFocus\
    \ Area: Classification of reviewed studies based on their focus on the sub-field\
    \ of hydrology \nand water resources. Although most studies focus on more than\
    \ one area, as a result of detailed \nanalysis, it was assumed that the study\
    \ was primarily focused on a single subject area. These \nsubject areas are classified\
    \ as follows: urban water management, water quality management, \nwater economics,\
    \ water governance, agricultural water management, water and sustainable \ndevelopment\
    \ goals (SDG) \nPurpose: Indicates the main use cases the study or product is\
    \ designed to address. \nDevelopment Level of Blockchain Application: Indicates\
    \ the degree to which the blockchain \ntechnology was used in the study. \nExplore:\
    \ Studies highlight the potential of blockchain applications in water resources\
    \ \nmanagement and hydrology and evaluate research and application gaps. Studies\
    \ classified in \nthis field are just for exploration and do not include blockchain\
    \ parameters. Therefore, these \nstudies were not examined for the following fields.\
    \  \nConceptual: Studies that propose a digital system architecture without a\
    \ tested application or \ncode list. \nSimulation: Studies in which a system is\
    \ designed, coded, and tested mostly in virtual machines \nbut not converted into\
    \ a real-world application. \nDecentralized Application (DApp): Studies in which\
    \ the system created can be used with a \nmobile or web-based application by designing\
    \ a special interface. The current activity of the \napplication created in the\
    \ studies or whether it is currently at the service of the users has not \nbeen\
    \ examined. \nPilot Project: Studies where any stage of the project is tested\
    \ with real-time data. \nBlockchain Type: It is a classification made according\
    \ to which type of blockchain infrastructure \nthe study proposes or uses. Since\
    \ the studies are divided into blockchain types at a very general \nlevel, they\
    \ are categorized as Public, Private, and Hybrid Blockchain, which contains the\
    \ \nfeatures of both types to a certain extent. \nBlockchain Technology: It is\
    \ a categorization made according to which blockchain technology \nprovider the\
    \ study proposes to use or uses. Studies were classified as Ethereum, Hyperledger,\
    \ \nand Other as a result of the review. \nSmart Contract/Chain Code Enabled:\
    \ A Boolean field specifying if the study includes a smart \ncontract or chain\
    \ code.  \nReproducibility: It determines if the blockchain application of the\
    \ study could be reproduced by \nusing the information provided. The classification\
    \ is carried out according to sharing level of \ndata and codebase as \"Yes\"\
    , \"No”, and \"Partly\".  \nCybersecurity Test: Evaluation of studies according\
    \ to whether they were subjected to cyber \nsecurity tests or not. \nOn-Chain\
    \ Data: Blockchain-based stored data is specified.  \nOff-Chain Data: Data stored\
    \ in the standard database are specified. \nConsensus Algorithm: Evaluation of\
    \ the consensus algorithm used by the blockchain \ninfrastructure used in the\
    \ study.  \nFeasibility Analysis: Provides a feasibility analysis for the blockchain-based\
    \ system components \ninvolved in the studies. \n \n3. Results \n3.1. Summary\
    \ of Findings \nThis section presents and examines graphical summaries of the\
    \ reviewed papers and non-academic \ncontent. The summarized graphical demonstration\
    \ includes the distribution of papers and non-\nacademic content by year and publication\
    \ type. Moreover, graphs about reviewed papers provide \ntechnical details about\
    \ blockchain use cases such as the application in the sub-field of hydrology,\
    \ \nthe development level of a blockchain application, the type of blockchain,\
    \ and the blockchain \nnetwork. \nA table showing the summarized information of\
    \ 103 papers and 57 non-academic content is \nincluded in the appendix (Table\
    \ A2 and A3). Considering the distribution of papers by years, an \napproximately\
    \ linear increase is observed. This trend can be explained by the increase in\
    \ the \napplication areas of blockchain technology and the increase in the exploration\
    \ and adoption of \nmodern technologies in hydrological processes. The number\
    \ of papers in 2022 seems not to have \nexceeded the previous two years yet. Considering\
    \ that the papers reviewed cover the period before \nOctober 15, 2022, this number\
    \ may support the continuing linear increase. In addition, sharp \nfluctuations\
    \ in cryptocurrency exchanges may have limited the applications of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology in different areas. Non-academic content production appears to\
    \ follow a steady \nuptrend, with the exception of a drastic dive in 2020. (Figure\
    \ 2). \n \n \nFigure 2. Distribution of academic and non-academic content by years\
    \ \n \nReviewed papers are classified as \"journal papers,\" \"conference papers,\"\
    \ \"book chapters,\" \n\"books,\" \"theses,\" \"working papers,\" and \"technical\

    \ at different conferences, both conference papers were considered. \nContents\

    \ While there is a dominance of journal and \nconference papers in the reviewed\
    \ papers, the number of postgraduate theses can be considered \nvery low. The\
    \ reason for this can be interpreted as the immature level of integration between\
    \ the \nacademic blockchain ecosystem and the hydroinformatics community, and\
    \ as a result, the \ndifficulty of finding a suitable use case to support a thesis\
    \ contribution as well as advisors \nexperienced in this interdisciplinary area.\
    \ Reviewed non-academic content is divided into three \npublication types including\
    \ web documents, whitepapers, and hackathon projects (Figure 3). \nProjects that\
    \ published whitepaper emphasize the potential applications instead of providing\
    \ real-\ntime hydrological application. Hackathon projects are the output of hackathon\
    \ events that directly \nfocus on hydrological processes. \n \n \nFigure 3. Distribution\
    \ of academic and non-academic content by publication type \n \nAnother classification\
    \ of reviewed papers is carried out according to their major contribution \nto\
    \ sub-fields of hydrology. Although most papers focused on more than one sub-field,\
    \ they were \ncategorized in the hydrology sub-field that was considered to be\
    \ the most focused area (Figure 4). \nWater Governance: These papers generally\
    \ anticipate using blockchain as a database and focus \non solving administrative\
    \ problems and building trust among stakeholders. Papers providing a \nliterature\
    \ review are also categorized here. \nWater Quality Management: These papers focus\
    \ on problems related to water quality, such as \nmonitoring, analysis, wastewater\
    \ management, and a more transparent demonstration of water \nquality standards\
    \ being met. \nWater Economics: These papers focus on approaches to water markets\
    \ at different scales for \nwater trading, water rights, water claims, and water\

    \ the \nhydrology applications are still in the maturation stage (Figure 5). It\
    \ is noteworthy that few studies \ninclude an application as an end product or\

    Number of Content\nBlockchain Network\nThe \"N/A\" column in Figure 6 and Figure\
    \ 7; represents the same articles as the \"Explore\" \ncolumn, which does not\
    \ suggest an architecture or system but simply explores potential \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology. Therefore, a blockchain type or a blockchain network\
    \ is \nout of the question, as the study only explores potential applications.\
    \ If a system or architecture is \nsuggested but no blockchain network or blockchain\
    \ type is specified in the paper, it is categorized \nas \"Not Available.\" The\
    \ reason why private blockchains are preferred more may be that the water-\nrelated\
    \ data in the use case is not intended to be shared transparently even if the\
    \ identities are \ncryptographically secure because most of the papers contain\
    \ conceptual and simulation studies. \nMoreover, fluctuating cryptocurrency markets\
    \ may be creating concerns about transaction fees to \nbe paid on public blockchains.\
    \ Ethereum and Hyperledger dominate the field of hydrology as well \nas other\
    \ application fields due to smart contract and private blockchain compatibility.\
    \ Other private \nblockchains represented in the review were Corda and BanQu.\
    \ \n \n3.2. Analysis of Academic Content  \nIn this section, the reviewed academic\
    \ content is briefly summarized. These summaries highlight \nthe papers' approach\
    \ to blockchain and hydrology integration. \n \n3.2.1. Water Governance \nThe\
    \ common consensus is that trust is a critical enabler in water governance. Reliable\
    \ data and \ncoordination are essential to establishing and maintaining the trust\
    \ layer. Blockchain provides an \nimmutable database to store water-related data\
    \ securely. This key feature of blockchain technology \nprovides a straightforward\
    \ framework for water governance stakeholder coordination. Moreover, \nsmart contracts\
    \ can contribute to sustainable water governance by codifying environmental and\
    \ \neconomic conditions. Sobrinho et al. (2019) describe how blockchain technology\
    \ can help to \nenhance financial transparency and trust while also helping to\
    \ improve water governance. Such an \nenhancement might be made possible, for\
    \ example, by the development of cryptocurrencies and \nthe use of smart contracts\
    \ to encourage actions aimed at water resource conservation. Sriyono \n(2020)\
    \ investigates the potential of blockchain technology to aid in the efficient\
    \ management of \nwater resources and offers a framework and architecture for\
    \ blockchain and water management. \nThe paper also discusses a potential blockchain-based\
    \ solution for the water quality problems in \nPuerto Rico. Scozzari et al. (2021)\
    \ examine how IoT, AI, and blockchain are used to digitally \ntransform smart\
    \ water networks and blockchain-enabled water rights trading.  \nDogo et al. (2019)\
    \ examine the effects of combining blockchain technologies with intelligent \n\
    water management and assert that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize\
    \ water and \nsanitation governance to achieve SDG 6 as envisioned by the United\
    \ Nations in 2035, through \ncreative, effective, and scalable solutions, based\
    \ on these two technologies in African cities. Poonia \net al. (2021) examine\
    \ the spatiotemporal distribution of several drought types, separately and \n\
    simultaneously, in India. A blockchain-based framework is suggested to enhance\
    \ the current \ndrought risk-management system to make it easier for those who\
    \ have died from drought to receive \nhelp and aid as soon as possible. Linjing\
    \ et al. (2020) explain the benefits and standout \ncharacteristics of blockchain-enabled\
    \ IoT applications and contrast them with centralized, more \nestablished IoT-based\
    \ smart water systems. Hangan et al. (2022) examine the potential \napplications\
    \ of big data and blockchain in the field of water resources and argue that blockchain\
    \ \ncan act as a link between a locally used solution and a global infrastructure\
    \ that is accessible \nglobally and is controlled by a coalition of international\
    \ organizations using consensus \nmechanisms.  \nIyer and Giri (2020) evaluate\
    \ water-related issues that may be solved by blockchain, which \nwill be important\
    \ in the area of ethical pricing and highlight data transparency as data is exchanged\
    \ \nacross networks for water reuse. Wu et al. (2022) thoroughly examine the properties\
    \ of blockchain \ntechnology, as well as the scenarios and applications that blockchain\
    \ has in the field of protecting \nwater resources, including the storage of data\
    \ about water bodies, cross-sectoral collaboration, and \nincreased public involvement\
    \ level. According to Ragghianti (2021), blockchain allows for the \nintegration\
    \ of watershed monitoring and direct management of water usage for all system\
    \ users, \nmaintaining flexibility and guaranteeing all socio-environmental constraints\
    \ that apply in that \nbasin. Xia et al. (2022) consider a distributed and decentralized\
    \ water data management system for \nthe whole supply, consumption, and discharge\
    \ processes. The system includes two conceptual \nhybrid blockchain-based application\
    \ scenarios: permits for water abstraction and water quality \ntracking. Singh\
    \ and Goel (2020) examine how blockchain might be used to notify authorities of\
    \ \nany emergency flood events.  \nYasuno et al. (2020) integrate upstream monitoring,\
    \ dam inflow prediction, a smart contract \nenabled blockchain framework to reimagine\
    \ the dam watershed as a smart dam and organize the \ntechnologies for flood prediction.\
    \ Study aims to facilitate real-time coordination among \nstakeholders and real-time\
    \ broadcast of disaster prevention information. Lin and Wang (2021) \nclaim that\
    \ SPOF and DDOS attacks have the potential to exploit the authentication and key\
    \ \nagreement in intelligent water conservation systems, thus suggesting a blockchain-based\
    \ \nauthentication key agreement system for smart water devices. The selected\
    \ network for blockchain \nis Ethereum, and to participate in the Ethereum network,\
    \ smart devices serve as light nodes. The \nlight node does not engage in mining\
    \ and merely downloads a small bit of the blockchain network. \nIt is appropriate\
    \ for conditions where there are more smart devices. The consensus algorithm for\
    \ \nthe blockchain system is Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).  \nAsgari\
    \ and Nemati (2022) investigate the literature based on the three primary Distributed\
    \ \nLedger Technology (DLT) application areas of Smart Water Systems, Water Quality\
    \ Monitoring, \nand Storm Water Management. Additionally, they address the legislative,\
    \ social, administrative, \nand practical difficulties which can be an obstacle\
    \ to the use of blockchain technology. Stankovic \net al. (2020) provide an overview\
    \ of possible blockchain-enabled applications in water and \nsanitation services\
    \ for Latin America and the Caribbean. Li et al. (2021) provide a peer-to-peer\
    \ \nblockchain system based on data to forecast water consumption. There are four\
    \ layers in the \nframework: i) the storage layer; ii) the network layer; iii)\
    \ the smart contract layer; and iv) the \napplication layer. \nZhang et al. (2020)\
    \ establish a platform with four decentralized participants, such as \ngovernment\
    \ agencies, water conservation private sector actors, the general public, and\
    \ third-party \nmaintenance. The study also provides the design of “dual chain”\
    \ smart contracts that are \"alliance \nchain and private chain.\" Additionally,\
    \ the many possibilities of blockchain-enabled platform \napplications for smart\
    \ water conservation are examined. Next, a novel development route \nincluding\
    \ consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, asymmetric encryption, and information\
    \ source \ntracing is suggested using the water rights trading market as an example.\
    \ Chinese Smart Water \nConservancy Platform Data is the main on-chain data in\
    \ the proposed system. Youssef et al. (2019) \nsuggest an unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV), cloud-based solution for dam site monitoring. The \nUAVs periodically\
    \ provide meteorological data, water quality and level information, and the \n\
    condition of dam structures.  Blockchain, which offers identification, a database\
    \ system, and \ntraceability of the UAV cloud's data transmission, ensures a distributed\
    \ and long-term security \nsolution. The effectiveness of the solution is simulated\
    \ by assessing the data delivery delay ratio.  \nMajia (2021) creates a blockchain-based\
    \ system that maintains the privacy of operational \nhydropower plant data. The\
    \ proposed system stores the homomorphic encrypted operational data \non chain.\
    \ Sukrutha et al. (2021) establish a unique blockchain architecture with double\
    \ hashing as \na data storage system that is more secure for groundwater management\
    \ data. The water level and \nwater quality data of aquifers are stored off-chain,\
    \ but the hash of the same data is stored on-chain. \nThe simulation is carried\
    \ out, and the transactional cost is examined. Simulation results show that \n\
    storing the hash of data is cost-effective. Mohammadi et al. (2022) create a hypothetical\
    \ \nblockchain-based system to securely exchange data gathered in real-time from\
    \ a variety of sensors \nfor monitoring and controlling water consumption. The\
    \ proposed consensus algorithm is proof of \nwork, and smart water meter data\
    \ is supposed to be directly stored on-chain.  \nDramski et al. (2019) describe\
    \ a system for gathering environmental data from meteorological \nsensors and\
    \ then storing it in a blockchain application. The application is powered by a\
    \ private \nHyperledger blockchain network and a sensor prototype developed on\
    \ a Raspberry Pi. Tiwari et \nal. (2020) suggest a public Ethereum-based blockchain\
    \ system designed to preserve water \nconsumption that satisfies the supply-demand\
    \ processes of all customers in a peer-to-peer network. \nVernekar (2020) outlines\
    \ a fully decentralized, blockchain-based approach for managing water \nsupply\
    \ that uses IoT devices to collect data along the configuration and add it to\
    \ the Ethereum \npublic blockchain.  \nSapra et al. (2021) provide a methodology\
    \ for creating an intelligent water management system \nthat determines and calculates\
    \ a consumer's water use within a certain area and also detects leaks \nin the\
    \ plumbing system. A private blockchain network is designed based on Ethereum,\
    \ and water \nquality, pressure, and location data for components of the water\
    \ distribution system are stored on \nthe block. The California Blockchain Working\
    \ Group (2020) investigates the potential for \nblockchain-based technology to\
    \ assist in the development of a more effective framework that \nbuilds on the\
    \ momentum of recent California water-related data initiatives. There are two\
    \ pilot \nproject-level studies in this category in the reviewed literature. Mughal\
    \ et al. (2022) conduct a pilot \nproject emphasizing blockchain-enabled solutions\
    \ for enhancing Pakistan's data-intensive \ndecision-support systems. The consistency,\
    \ immutability, and dependability of streamflow time \nseries data were maintained\
    \ using a private blockchain that was built on the Hyperledger Fabric \nplatform.\
    \ The model evaluated the use of Hyperledger fabric, employing the distributed\
    \ \nautonomous administrative authority of Pakistan's irrigation network. In addition\
    \ to collecting \nsensor data for streamflow prediction, the nodes also maintain\
    \ permanent data storage on the \nstreamflow record and aggregate and approve\
    \ compliance with the distribution system via \nchaincode (smart contracts). The\
    \ proof of authority protocol allows the designated nodes with \nauthorization\
    \ to create new blocks of streamflow data monitoring irrigation networks, thus\
    \ \nmaintaining the chain's overall security.  \nAnother pilot project is carried\
    \ out by Coli et al. (2021). The pilot project in Peru aims to \ndemonstrate the\
    \ viability of integrating blockchain technology into the microfinance industry\
    \ for \nwater and sanitation to increase the effectiveness of the current microfinance\
    \ model and support \nthe inclusion of unbanked people in the financial system.\
    \ Pilot study also allows for more discovery \nthrough first-hand experiences\
    \ with local microfinance organizations and borrowers. The private \nblockchain\
    \ network of BanQu is preferred for the project, and a feasibility analysis is\
    \ conducted \nto show operationally cost-effective scenarios as a result of blockchain\
    \ implementation. \n \n3.2.2. Water Economics  \nWater economics is the consideration\
    \ of the economic value of water as a natural resource and the \nadded value it\
    \ creates in the areas where it is used within the framework of microeconomic\
    \ \ntheories. The focus of these theories is to maintain the quality and quantity\
    \ of water under \neconomic and financial constraints and to make water-related\
    \ investment, cost and water markets \nefficient. The water economics has been\
    \ a substantial area of research for exploring blockchain \napplications due to\
    \ its intrinsic need for and obvious utility of adopting trustworthy data and\
    \ \ncurrency sharing mechanisms. Bhaduri et al. (2021) investigate the opportunities\
    \ for potential \nwater market implementation in Los Angeles, USA, and Bengaluru,\
    \ India. Poberezhna (2018) \nexplores how blockchain-based tools could assist\
    \ the water sector's businesses and governing \nbodies in gaining access to real-time\
    \ data about market shares, consumption trends, consumer bill \nmanagement, and\
    \ other possibilities. Ikeda and Liffiton (2019) introduce two possible use cases\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based water management: i) blockchain-based water and sanitation\
    \ subsidies, and \nii) using blockchain tools to manage water pricing and consumption.\
    \  \nBou Abdo and Zeadally (2020) create a commercially and economically viable\
    \ peer-to-peer \ntrading platform for water and energy that supports rainwater\
    \ gathering and trade of the captured \nwater. The rainwater harvested data is\
    \ directly stored on-chain. Thomason et al. (2018) examine \nthe relationship\
    \ between blockchain technology and climate finance as both relate to the problem\
    \ \nof water scarcity in poor nations and propose blockchain-based water trading\
    \ applications as a \npotential solution. Zhao et al. (2019) underline the significance\
    \ of creating a peer-to-peer trading \nnetwork with blockchain capabilities that\
    \ would enable more irrigators to take part in the platform \nthat secures and\
    \ transparently allocates water, increasing the total efficiency of water resources.\
    \ \nZecchini (2019) investigates the potential application scenarios for blockchain-enabled\
    \ water \nquality credit systems. Grigoras et al. (2018) introduce blockchain\
    \ and smart contracts integrated \ninto a theoretical water rights trading platform.\
    \ Angara and Saripalle (2022) review the virtual \nwater literature systematically\
    \ and provide a conceptual virtual water currency and blockchain-\nenabled virtual\
    \ water trade system. Sivaramakrishnan (2020) proposes a blockchain-enabled \n\
    architecture for water trading platforms between agricultural stakeholders. The\
    \ Ethereum public \nnetwork is preferred to perform regulatory requirements as\
    \ smart contracts. Belliera et al. (2019) \ncreate a flood insurance system powered\
    \ by blockchain.  \nVannucci et al. (2021) extend this study and aim to contribute\
    \ to the analysis and management \nof flood events from an economic and financial\
    \ perspective from a public administration \nviewpoint. The study also entends\
    \ the unique and robust blockchain-based insurance systems. \nZhang (2022) provides\
    \ a design of a conceptual blockchain-based supply chain financial system \nmodel\
    \ for water resources businesses, and a model to analyze the financial condition\
    \ of seven \nwater businesses for their potential blockchain-based digital transformation\
    \ in China. Their \nconceptual blockchain-based architecture is designed to store\
    \ the financial supply chain of water \nresources data directly. Miller (2021)\
    \ and Ramsey et al. (2020) describe and evaluate the \napplication of blockchain\
    \ capabilities to the water rights trading ecosystem and design a variety of \n\
    services that leverage blockchain features and business value. Pee et al. (2018)\
    \ and Alcarria et al. \n(2018) examine the potential for a simple peer-to-peer\
    \ water market based on smart contracts with \nwater trading data stored on the\
    \ Ethereum private network. Liu and Shang (2022) propose hybrid \nblockchain approach\
    \ for trading water rights and Li et al. (2022b) use chain code to enable \ntransactional\
    \ water rights data storage in a private Hyperledger Fabric network for the same\
    \ \npurpose. \nThis category contains one study at the DApp level and one study\
    \ at the pilot project level. \nAbu-Amara et al. (2022) develop a blockchain-based\
    \ application to manage the supply of water \nand energy transactions. The application\
    \ records water and energy use data on a private \nHyperledger network and allows\
    \ consumers to view and pay bills online. CRCNA (2020) provides \na pilot project\
    \ with Civic Ledger, an Australian start-up, in Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply\
    \ \nScheme (MDWSS), Northern Australia. Water Ledger, which is Civic Ledger's\
    \ water trading \nplatform built on Ethereum, is customized to the MDWSS business\
    \ and operational standards to \nexamine how blockchain technology can minimize\
    \ trading costs, boost the effectiveness of trade \nprocesses, and raise water\
    \ market transparency. The pilot project highlights that blockchain-\nenabled\
    \ systems have the potential to codify regulatory rules, reduce transaction costs,\
    \ and avoid \nasymmetric information about actual water prices. The main challenge\
    \ for the next phases of the \nproject is that the existing water market and the\
    \ water delivery infrastructure are not interoperable. \n \n3.2.3.  Water Quality\
    \ Management \nWater quality management is the entire process of monitoring the\
    \ water quality from the source to \nthe user, taking measures to protect the\
    \ water quality, and treating the water if necessary. In this \nwhole process,\
    \ reliable data and real-time monitoring are vital for the detection of possible\
    \ \ncontamination and the efficiency of the treatment process. Kassou et al. (2020)\
    \ propose a \nblockchain-enabled conceptual system design to control and track\
    \ medical wastewater \ninfrastructure. Damania et al. (2019) consider the blockchain\
    \ as a next-generation data storage \nsystem and discuss potential integration\
    \ in terms of water quality management. Ortiz (2018) points \nout the capabilities\
    \ of blockchain applications to improve public awareness and governmental \naccountability\
    \ about water quality at all scales in Puerto Rico. Yan et al. (2019) present\
    \ a \nconceptual blockchain-enabled environmental monitoring system architecture\
    \ that data analysis, \nstakeholder authentication and water quality data are\
    \ synchronized. Wan et al. 2020) deliver an \nAI-supported management system for\
    \ wastewater treatment facilities and investigate blockchain \nas a data storage\
    \ system.  \nHakak et al. (2020) conceptualize a blockchain-enabled smart contract-supported\
    \ industrial \nwastewater management system. Quist-Aphetsi and Blankson (2019)\
    \ explores the cryptographic \nfeatures of Secure Hash Function 256, which is\
    \ the most popular hash function in blockchain \napplications, and examine a potential\
    \ hybrid data logging system that store cryptographically the \nquality of water\
    \ delivered to consumers from the water treatment plant. Kaur and Oza (2020) \n\
    document the Ethereum Request for Comment Standards 20 (ERC20) from a smart city\
    \ \nperspective that Ethereum-based tokens must comply with. The paper simulates\
    \ the Water \nReprocessing Coins (WRC) to create a business environment where\
    \ everyone has an equal chance \nof obtaining credits based on recycled wastewater\
    \ to remove inequalities between different-scale \nenterprises. Iyer et al. (2019)\
    \ propose a private blockchain network based on Hyperledger to \nmaximize the\
    \ effectiveness of wastewater recycling systems for industries. The study's simulation\
    \ \nprocess includes anomaly detection algorithms to apply chaincode rules for\
    \ possible penalties to \nindustries attempting to tamper with water quality sensors.\
    \  \nLin et al. (2020) simulate an integrated system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ that is structured \nas a directed acyclic graph and uses geographic information\
    \ system tools for source tracking of \nriver water quality problems. Berman et\
    \ al. (2020) provide an implementation of a blockchain-\nenabled framework for\
    \ sample identification and logging together with small autonomous boats \nthat\
    \ can navigate to measure chemical water quality parameters automatically. Niya\
    \ et al. (2018) \npropose an IoT-enabled LoRa-based system for monitoring water\
    \ pollution that is completely \ndecentralized by storing and retrieving data\
    \ from IoT sensors on the Ethereum blockchain network. \nCrawford et al. (2021)\
    \ create an R3 Corda-based DLT system for oil and gas underground injection \n\
    control (UIC) operations to maintain the water quality of freshwater aquifers.\
    \ Gudmundsson and \nHougaard (2021) create a model that explicitly demonstrates\
    \ the influence of water quality on \nproduction profits and offer a plan for\
    \ distributing the profits of the best possible pollution \nabatement. In order\
    \ to automate negotiations, the paper offers a decentralized solution using smart\
    \ \ncontracts. \nThe DApp level categorized in this section is conducted by Alharbi\
    \ et al. (2021). Initially, the \nstudy focuses on measuring the water quality\
    \ parameters in industrial tanks and looking for any \nviolations using IoT (Internet\
    \ of Things). Afterward, Hyperledger's private application is used to \nenforce\
    \ the necessary penalties on the violating industrial facility and sustain the\
    \ accuracy, \ndependability, and transparency of the records of violations. The\
    \ technology will be able to \nmeasure the quality of the water in real time and\
    \ enable the immediate identification of any \nviolation to apply the appropriate\
    \ penalties. The administration can access the decentralized web \napplication\
    \ to track the status of water measures for registered industrial facilities and\
    \ evaluate the \ndata linked to water violations with easy-to-read illustrations.\
    \ Shi et al. (2019) present a cutting-\nedge IoT solution that uses a Hyperledger\
    \ private network to preserve healthy drinking water \nconsumption in schools.\
    \ It is mentioned that 39 schools have already implemented the project in \nHangzhou's\
    \ Shangcheng District, China. The project reduces the workload of health professionals\
    \ \nand encourages the transformation from conventional site-based inspection\
    \ to automated remote \nmonitoring. \n \n3.2.4.  Agricultural Water Management\
    \ \nAgricultural water management aims to provide the optimum amount and quality\
    \ of water for \nagricultural products by considering the continuity of ecosystem\
    \ services. This optimization is \npossible by prioritizing data security related\
    \ to agricultural water management processes, Dong \nand Fu (2021), Liu et al.\
    \ (2020) and Kumar et al. (2021) examine possible applications for \nblockchain-based\
    \ digital solutions in the agricultural industry and assess the transformation\
    \ \nprocess of traditional agriculture to blockchain-based digitalized smart agriculture\
    \ systems. Liu et \nal. (2021) and Ferrag et al. (2020) provide a systematic review\
    \ of information communication \ntechnologies (ICT) and blockchain-enabled agricultural\
    \ applications.  \nDragulinescu et al. (2021) propose a blockchain-enabled conceptual\
    \ system to maximize smart \nirrigation by storing the water quality, air quality,\
    \ and weather data on chain. Dragulinescu et al. \n(2021) extend the conceptualized\
    \ framework and perform simulation studies to store and monitor \nsome physical\
    \ and chemical water quality parameters for irrigation networks, such as temperature,\
    \ \ndissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity. Chang et al. (2021) offer a conceptual\
    \ Ethereum-based \nirrigation system that stores agricultural supply and demand\
    \ data on-chain. Krishna et al. (2021) \nprovide a smart agricultural system architecture\
    \ that stores soil moisture and temperature on \nblockchain to protect agricultural\
    \ data security. Sakthi and DafniRose (2022) propose a \nHyperledger private network\
    \ to provide data transparency and reliability for agricultural \nstakeholders\
    \ to encourage them to reduce pesticide and fertilizer-based water and soil pollution.\
    \ \nLin et al. (2017) discuss the potential blockchain applications and propose\
    \ an architecture based \non ICT and hybrid Ethereum network integration.  \n\
    RajaRajeswari et al. (2022) provide a blockchain-enabled conceptualized framework\
    \ for smart \ngardening as a component of the smart city concept. Munir et al.\
    \ (2019) and Ting et al. (2022) \npropose a smart irrigation system that uses\
    \ fuzzy logic-based algorithms for decision-support \nprocesses and blockchain\
    \ for data reliability. Zeng et al. (2021) simulate a system for managing \nand\
    \ coordinating the usage of high-quality seeds and water resources between communities;\
    \ an \neffective tracking system for seed quality and a smart irrigation management\
    \ system are designed \nusing IoT and blockchain integration. Giaffreda et al.\
    \ (2019), Bordel et al. (2019) and Pincheira et \nal. (2021) provide Ethereum-based\
    \ agricultural water management systems which include private, \nhybrid, and public\
    \ networks respectively. These three studies provide a system that encourages\
    \ \nand rewards ethical behavior in agriculture activities for specific multi-stakeholder\
    \ ecosystems. \nThe main aim of these studies is to create more sustainable and\
    \ environmentally friendly irrigation \nwater consumption system. \nEnescu et\
    \ al. (2020) describe a DApp that is centered on bringing together small farming\
    \ \ncommunities for effective solar panel-based agricultural management. The DApp\
    \ is suggested for \nmanaging both energy and water. The system uses the Ethereum\
    \ public network and smart \ncontracts, which enable customers to trade energy\
    \ and water. ERC20 is implemented for \ntransactions, and two cryptocurrencies\
    \ are introduced including SIST (Small Irrigation System \nToken) and Solar Coin.\
    \  \n \n3.2.5.  Urban Water Management \nUrban water management aims to perform\
    \ urban water services in an integrated manner. The main \nelements of urban water\
    \ management are water supply, drainage and treatment facilities. The \naccountability\
    \ of the urban water authority can become more sustainable within the framework\
    \ of \nblockchain. Alnahari and Ariaratnam (2022), Lukić et al. (2022), Makani\
    \ et al. (2022), Kim et al. \n(2022) and Kumar et al. (2022) investigate the possible\
    \ blockchain application for smart cities. It \nis summarized that blockchain\
    \ has the potential to enhance water security and accountability \nthrough the\
    \ distribution of transparent, secure ledger accounts. In addition, water quantity\
    \ and \nquality can be tracked for whole water supply and demand processes including\
    \ storage, \ntransmission, treatment, and consumption. Public awareness and trust\
    \ layer between citizens are \nthe main contributions of blockchain and smart\
    \ city integration.  \nMahmoud et al., (2019) examine the viability of combining\
    \ Blockchain with intelligent water \nnetworks through case studies. Additionally,\
    \ identity anonymity methods that could be integrated \nwith the system and the\
    \ customer's data are explored, and a distributed ledger and blockchain-\nbased\
    \ data aggregation mechanism for the smart meters are suggested. They extend this\
    \ study and \ndesign a MATLAB toolbox that can simulate blockchain-enabled water\
    \ distribution systems. \nDifferent algorithms for consensus mechanisms in blockchain\
    \ are compared according to their \nmining time and giving the user the option\
    \ to select the desired one (Mahmoud et al. 2021). Lalle \net al. (2020) present\
    \ the use of blockchain technology with the machine learning algorithm k-\nmeans\
    \ to preserve user privacy. Users are grouped into clusters, and every cluster\
    \ has a \npermissioned blockchain to store the data of its members.  \nZecchini\
    \ et al. (2020) introduce particular fields in their description, and they describe\
    \ the use \nof Solidity design patterns applied to urban water management scenarios\
    \ to provide blockchain \ndevelopers with greater assistance in making important\
    \ decisions to create effective decentralized \napplications. Sundaresan et al.\
    \ (2021) propose a blockchain-enabled system that stores the \nquantitative and\
    \ qualitative data of water distribution systems. Thakur et al. (2021) provide\
    \ an \nincentive-based architecture for smart water distribution and saving that\
    \ combines blockchain \ntechnology with edge computing. In the framework, houses\
    \ are designed as nodes of the Ethereum-\nbased network. The computation operates\
    \ at the network's edge and offers a quick water-saving \nincentive system. Arsene\
    \ et al. (2020) and Pahontu et al. (2020) are similar studies that provide a \n\
    water supply system integrated with Hyperledger to manage customer demand more\
    \ effectively. \nRottondi and Verticale (2017) propose a public blockchain-enabled\
    \ smart water metering \narchitecture and a serious gaming platform to incentivize\
    \ sustainable urban water consumption. \nPredescu et al. (2021) develop a system\
    \ at the application level that provides a serious gaming \napproach for urban\
    \ water management from the standpoint of mobile crowd sensing. Each \ncrowdsensing\
    \ task includes a chaincode-based incentive mechanism, and the trust layer of\
    \ the \nsystem is secured by Hyperledger Fabric.  \n \n3.2.6.  Water and SDGs\
    \ \nSDG-6 aims at sustainable water and sanitation services for all. Mora et al.\
    \ (2021) outline the key \nsustainability concerns that cryptocurrency and blockchain\
    \ technologies are addressing in terms \nof SDG-6 Clean Water and Sanitation.\
    \ Le Sève et al. (2018) and Parmentola et al. (2021) provide \na literature review\
    \ about the potential of blockchain for improvements in environmental \nsustainability.\
    \ Mattila et al. (2022) investigate the potential of blockchain-enabled data storage\
    \ \nsystems for their contribution to reaching SDG targets such as climate change,\
    \ biodiversity loss, \nand water scarcity. \n \n3.3. Analysis of Non-Academic\
    \ Content  \nIn this section, the reviewed non-academic content is briefly summarized.\
    \ Web documents \ngenerally focus on the potential of blockchain for hydrological\
    \ applications and underline the \nbeneficial outputs. The most emphasized issue\
    \ is that the blockchain-based storage of hydrological \ndata creates a layer\
    \ of trust between the stakeholders who depend on the quantity and quality of\
    \ \nthe same water resource. Another issue is the advantages of blockchain-based\
    \ digitalization of \ntraditional water markets, which are currently traded, such\
    \ as accountability, easier access to \ninstant market information, and low transaction\
    \ fees.  \nWater Services Regulation Authority, a non-ministerial government department\
    \ of the UK, \npublished a report about customer data reliability and recommended\
    \ blockchain to UK water \ncompanies in 2017 (Ofwat, 2017). A digital asset platform\
    \ BANKEX introduces a pilot initiative \ncalled “water coin” that aims to generate\
    \ direct investments for clean water provision safely by \ncutting out any intermediaries\
    \ or other parties that could taint the process in Kenya (Bankex, 2018). \nFujitsu\
    \ launches a new blockchain water trading system that enables the safe use of\
    \ botanical \nwater. The botanical water harvesting process is the transformation\
    \ of food waste into drinking \nwater. Companies that want to use botanical water\
    \ can purchase it from a suitable refinery by using \na blockchain-enabled mechanism\
    \ provided by Fujitsu (Fujitsu, 2021). \nThe aims of the projects that publish\
    \ whitepapers or hackathon projects focus on to provide \nblockchain-based storage\
    \ of data on water distribution systems, detection, management, and \nprevention\
    \ of water pollution sources; ensure more reliable traceability of water-related\
    \ \ninvestments; create wastewater management layers for both treatment and environmental\
    \ \ndischarge processes; create micro water trading system for smart cities; and\
    \ create more \naccountable water supply-chain processes.  \n4. Discussion \n\
    Blockchain-enabled hydrological applications are unique to each use case and difficult\
    \ to \nstandardize but the literature has agreed on four fundamental benefits\
    \ of blockchain-based \nhydrological applications, which are described below.\
    \ \nWater Trust: Since the blockchain has a decentralized structure, none of the\
    \ stakeholders are \ndirectly the owners of the system. In addition, it is certain,\
    \ thanks to smart contracts, that \nhydrological and administrative rules are\
    \ followed by all parties. This creates a trust layer \nbetween parties that depend\
    \ on the same water source, even if they are not aware of each other. \nWater\
    \ Data Security: In the blockchain, the data is distributed among the nodes that\
    \ support the \nsystem in a completely distributed manner. This makes the system\
    \ safe from traditional \ncyberattacks and power outages. Since the data is stored\
    \ cryptographically, even if the data is \ncaptured in some way, it cannot be\
    \ disclosed unless the user wants it. It provides data security \nfor natural\
    \ and legal persons. \nImmutable Water Transaction Ledgers: Data recorded in distributed\
    \ ledgers cannot be deleted. It \nprovides a single and common database for stakeholders.\
    \ \nWater Accountability: Transactional data records on the blockchain are publicly\
    \ available for \nanyone to view and verify. There is no need for a third-party\
    \ verification system or trusted data \nprovider to verify the data. \nTheoretically,\
    \ the potential benefits of blockchain-based hydrological applications are \n\
    discussed in detail, but real-time simulation and application stage studies are\
    \ scarce in the \nliterature. Moreover, there is no blockchain-based hydrological\
    \ application where the \nenvironmental, economic, and regulatory rules are coded\
    \ as smart contracts and real-time data is \nprocessed. Although 34% of academic\
    \ content includes simulation, application, or a pilot project, \nthe data shared\
    \ about the process is very limited. The simulation results are mostly graphical\
    \ \nrepresentation for the measured water quantity and quality. This can be explained\
    \ by the \nfluctuations in cryptocurrency exchanges affecting trust in blockchain\
    \ technology and prolonging \nthe maturation process of blockchain technology.\
    \ Blockchain technologies are currently immature \nfor large scale operational\
    \ and regulatory applications and difficult to justify for long-term \ninvestment\
    \ and commitment. \nAnother notable point in the review is that a detailed smart\
    \ contract-oriented feasibility, or \noptimization study on blockchain transaction\
    \ fees related to the simulation, application, and pilot \nproject-level studies\
    \ is very limited. The efficient design of codes in the rules determined by smart\
    \ \ncontracts has a great impact on transaction fees and can make the whole system\
    \ feasible. Moreover, \nwhile the data recorded on the blockchain is immutable,\
    \ coding the smart contract is critical. A \nvulnerability in smart contract codes\
    \ could lead to incorrect recording or manipulation of data \n(Nelaturu et al.,\
    \ 2021). A smart contract can only be as smart as the developer who codes it.\
    \  \nAnother important issue is the blockchain oracle problem. Blockchains are\
    \ isolated from \nphysical systems, so they need blockchain oracles that enable\
    \ data exchange with physical systems \n(Lo et al. 2020). IoTs that send water-related\
    \ data to the blockchain must send reliable data. \nOtherwise, the blockchain\
    \ system will store incorrect data even if the smart contract is coded \nperfectly.\
    \ In the literature, there is a lack of blockchain oracle research focused on\
    \ flowmeters and \nwater quality sensors that record water-related data and send\
    \ it to the blockchain system. Although \nthe use of Ethereum and Hyperledger\
    \ dominates the literature, due to the block structures that \nallow smart contract\
    \ design, their hydrological advantages and disadvantages against each other \n\
    are not evaluated in the literature. Similarly, the hydrological evaluation of\
    \ the advantages of \nprivate and public blockchain applications against each\
    \ other is not included in the literature. \n \n5. Recommendations for Future\
    \ Work \nExtensive research and case studies is needed with a real-time application\
    \ focus to directly observe \nand evaluate the theoretical benefits of the blockchain\
    \ technology. Research involving more real-\ntime applications will encourage\
    \ more water authorities to test the blockchain-based performance \nof their existing\
    \ systems. It is necessary to analyze the economic and financial feasibility of\
    \ the \nblockchain-based digital transformation, which includes the optimization\
    \ of the blockchain system \nitself and the digital connection with the physical\
    \ water systems. In addition, hydrology-focused \nsmart contract optimization\
    \ and blockchain oracle framework development research are essential. \nGeneralized\
    \ architectures and blockchain systems that can serve as a plug-and-play technology\
    \ to \nmany use cases and organizations are essential for realizing the potential\
    \ in hydrological \napplications such as water rights trading or urban water supply-chain.\
    \ Water authorities or \ncompanies may want to enjoy the benefits of blockchain\
    \ applications without needing to learn the \ncryptographic background. \nPrivate\
    \ and public blockchain-enabled networks have advantages and disadvantages for\
    \ a \nwater system, but there is no study in the literature focusing on this comparison.\
    \ While public \nblockchain networks provide greater accountability, there are\
    \ higher transaction fees. This issue \nshould be discussed in particular within\
    \ applications of water systems. Similarly, different \nconsensus algorithms provide\
    \ different features, however, there is a lack of hydrology-focused \ncomparison\
    \ studies about the issue.  \nTransboundary water systems management is one of\
    \ the most important areas of hydrology \nwhere stakeholders have a problem of\
    \ trust, reliable data are needed, and a common water \nmanagement approach should\
    \ be adopted (Albrecht and Gerlak, 2022). Transboundary water \nsystems are an\
    \ important field of study with great potential, considering the theoretical benefits\
    \ of \nblockchain such as accountability, transparency, and immutability. Virtual\
    \ water trade and water \nfootprint, which are other sub-branches of hydrology,\
    \ also have the potential to be digitalized with \na blockchain-oriented perspective.\
    \ The international trade of products brings with it the \ninternational flow\
    \ of virtual water (Delpasand et al., 2023). The supply chains of products can\
    \ be \nmanaged on a blockchain basis by adding water footprint and virtual water\
    \ trade data. \nThe last point to be underlined about blockchain-based applications\
    \ is the Non-Fungible \nTokens (NFT). An NFT is a type of cryptocurrency; however,\
    \ in this definition, the money in \nquestion can be any asset that has value\
    \ (Flick, 2022). Assets that can be considered NFTs include \nany piece of art,\
    \ video, tweet, a website, images, and stories that are created on social media.\
    \ NFTs \ncannot be exchanged for another identical token, as NFTs are unique and\
    \ no two are alike. This \nproperty is called \"non-fungibility,\" that is, \"\
    unchangeable.\" Public blockchains provide these \ntokens with provable rarity,\
    \ while smart contracts ensure that they are non-reproducible and \nunique. In\
    \ water resources management, any product's water footprint certificate or water\
    \ quality \ncredits can be stored as NFTs. Similarly, any investment, water-related\
    \ bill, or tax payment can be \nstored as NFTs with the limits drawn by the smart\
    \ contract, making it immutable who pays when \nand how much. \n \n6. Conclusions\
    \ \nThis paper provides a systematic literature review of applications to address\
    \ hydrological \nchallenges using blockchain technology. A total of 104 academic\
    \ publications and 37 non-\nacademic studies dealing with hydrology and water\
    \ resources were analyzed in detail. During the \nperiod of analysis covered,\
    \ between 2017 and October 15, 2022, it was observed that the number \nof publications\
    \ for blockchain-based hydrological applications has increased linearly since\
    \ 2017, \nwith an observable drop in 2020, only to continue following an uptrend.\
    \ This study evaluates the \npotential for existing application areas to be enhanced\
    \ with a more sophisticated use of blockchain \ntechnology as well as the realization\
    \ of potential new hydrological applications. \nDetailed review results demonstrate\
    \ that the blockchain-enabled hydrological applications \nhave not reached maturity.\
    \ However, there is a gap in research on hydrological applications and \nthe implementation\
    \ of water resources management projects that process and use real-time data.\
    \ \nWith more research and development to address the identified gaps, blockchain\
    \ technology holds \ngreat potential and may provide sustainable utility in the\
    \ field of hydroinformatics. \n \n7. References \nAbu-Amara, F., Alrammal, M.,\

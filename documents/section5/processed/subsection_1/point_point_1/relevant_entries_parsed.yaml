    * The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the potential of advanced
    predictive models, such as deep learning (e.g., LSTM, CNN) and ensemble methods
    (e.g., Random Forests), for precise, site-specific irrigation recommendations.


    * The authors collected thermal-RGB data from wheat crops under different irrigation
    treatments and growth stages.


    * The data was used to train deep learning models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception
    V3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet50) for water stress classification.


    * The authors also used function approximation-based machine learning models (Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN), Kernel Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR),
    and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) for water stress classification, using crop
    environmental (Ta, RH, and SMC) and temperature (Tc, from thermal images) inputs.


    * The results showed that the deep learning models, particularly ResNet50, outperformed
    the function approximation-based machine learning models for water stress classification,
    achieving accuracy scores of up to 98.4%.

    Five DL models were selected as the feature extraction-based approaches (1) AlexNet;

    were se-lected for their extraordinary capabilities of automated feature extraction,

  extract_2: '**Function Approximation-Based Approaches**


    Four ML models; ANN, KNN, LR, and SVM and a DL-based LSTM (DL-LSTM) were se-lected
    as the function approximation approaches for crop water stress classiﬁcation.
    The ML models were selected as those provide an opportunity to analyze numerous
    features simultaneously unlike traditional methods. ANN is effective in learning
    complex nonlinear functions and segmenting data based on the learned weights.
    The input layer had four variables to extract features from 1600 samples while
    the output layer had one neuron to calculate the probability of each class [47].
    KNN classiﬁes a data point based on its distance from the maximum number of training
    data points in the neighborhood. Typically, KNN uses Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan,
    or Hamming distances out of which Minkowski dis-tance has been reported to be
    more reliable [48] and was therefore selected in the model. LR classiﬁes data
    points into discrete classes based on probability using a sigmoid or logistic
    function [49]. SVM shifts data points to a higher dimension using linear, non-linear,
    and radial kernels to achieve linear separability [50] and then identiﬁes a hyperplane
    for the highest possible distance between data points of the two classes.'

    angles, object orientations, relative positions, and various clustering and occlusion
    situations.


    * CNNs have evolved to be the most powerful approach for solving target identification
    and classification problems. The superiority of a CNN in image recognition lies
    in its ability to extract increasingly complex visual concepts and features through
    hierarchical structures.


    * Some researchers designed an intelligent strawberry-grading system by integrating
    conveyer belts, cameras, and other auxiliary devices and employing multi-attribute
    decision-making theory to grade the strawberry fruit into three or four classes
    based on color, shape (13 feature parameters), and size. The final accuracy was
    above 90%.


    * Liming et al. designed an intelligent strawberry-grading system by integrating
    conveyer belts, cameras, and other auxiliary devices and employing multi-attribute
    decision-making theory to grade the strawberry fruit into three or four classes
    based on color, shape (13 feature parameters), and size. The final accuracy was
    above 90%.


    * Mahendra et al. compared seven types of features and used the SVM classifier
    to categorize the fruits into two groups: good and damaged. They found that the
    speeded-up robust features (SURF) were most effective in classification, with
    an accuracy of 90.73%. Sustika et al. evaluated the capability of six CNN architectures
    (the baseline CNN, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, Xception, and MobileNet) for the
    binary classification (good or bad) of strawberry fruit and its classification
    into four grading levels (1–4 ranking) using RGB images. The study indicated that
    VGGNet’s performance was the best, producing 96.49% and 89.12% accuracy for the
    binary and the four-grade-level classification, respectively.


    * Image texture analysis has also revealed the importance of certain features,
    including roundness, smoothness, and concavity of strawberries, which are highly
    correlated with maturity. For example, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using
    a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to identify strawberry ripeness
    by identifying and counting strawberry flowers and immature and mature fruits
    from UAV high-resolution images obtained at two heights (2 m and 3 m). The results
    showed that the mean average precision was higher at 2 m (83%) than at 3 m (72%).


    * Hyperspectral images are useful for evaluating internal fruit quality attributes,
    such as soluble solid content, acidity, color, and postharvest quality attributes,
    such as firmness. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and multiple/hyperspectral
    imaging technology have been effective for evaluating internal fruit quality attributes
    in a non-contact manner. A difference between spectroscopy and imaging is that
    the former can only obtain single-point information, while the latter can provide
    spatial distribution.


    * Fruit shape is a critical parameter affecting the esthetic appearance and marketability
    of strawberries. Basic shape descriptors, such as length, width, and aspect ratio,
    can be manually measured with, for example, a vernier caliper. However, this method
    is not only labor intensive and time consuming but also limited in capturing the
    complex and multi-dimensional aspects of shape and uniformity.


    * Ishikawa et al. extracted four types of shape descriptors from RGB images taken
    by a digital camera: (1) measured values, including contour line length, fruit
    length and width, and fruit width/length ratio; (2) ellipse similarity (ES) index,
    including the optimum ellipse area ratio and the boundary length ratio, which
    indicate the ellipse similarity of fruits; (3) elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs);
    and (4) chain code subtraction (CCS).


    * Oo and Aung proposed a simpler but efficient method for strawberry size estimation
    and shape classification based on RGB images only three parameters (diameter,
    length, and apex angle) were imported into a three-layer neural network for four
    classes. The estimation accuracy of diameter and length was 94% and 93%, respectively,
    for strawberries without calyx occlusion and 94% and 89% for those with calyx
    occlusion. The classification was between 94% and 97%. Feldmann et al. further
    extracted 68 strawberry fruit shape features of four types (linear and geometric
    descriptors, outline-based descriptors, landmark-based descriptors, and binary-image-pixel-based
    descriptors) from digital images and introduced a method called principal progression
    of k clusters (PPKC), which can automatically discover potential shape classes.
    Relationships between four shape categories and features were built and used for
    the classification. The accuracy varied from 68% to 99%.


    * Strawberry harvesting can extend for many months depending on the growing system
    and environment, with dramatic variation in weekly yields. Forecasting strawberry
    yield ahead of time can help growers formulate labor/equipment allocation strategies
    during the harvesting period. Since weather fluctuation is a key factor, many
    studies have been conducted on how weather parameters (e.g., solar radiation,
    wind, temperature) influence strawberry yield. These significant influential factors
    were combined with other yield-associated traits as input for statistical models
    and machine learning methods to predict strawberry yield.


    * For example, Misaghi et al. applied three neural network models (multilayer
    perception (MLP), generalized feedforward neural network (GFNN), and modular neural
    network) for strawberry yield prediction using vegetation indices (normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI))
    and soil characteristic parameters, with up to 94% final accuracy.


    * Remote sensing data acquisition and machine learning data analysis are already
    advancing the prospects of strawberry precision agriculture and phenomics applications,
    there is still an urgent need for further exploration. For example, questions
    related to how to expand the robustness and transferability of the statistical
    and machine learning models connecting fruit quality to image-based spectral and
    geometrical information are still active research topics. Deep learning is also
    very promising for further advances in fruit quality assessment. A deep learning
    method may enable obtaining multiple fruit quality parameters, such as shape,
    size, color, and internal attributes, simultaneously, which can help build a comprehensive
    evaluation system for strawberries and promote the automation of postharvest grading
    processes.'

  explanation: 'The paper "A digital footprint in enhancing agricultural practices
    with improved production using machine learning" by Pabitha C. and Benila S. proposes
    a system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze various data sources
    and predict crop yields, detect pests and diseases, and optimize irrigation schedules.
    Specifically, the paper explores the use of random forest algorithms for precision,
    site-specific irrigation management.


    Machine learning algorithms are trained on historical data to learn patterns and
    relationships between input features (such as weather, soil conditions, and crop
    growth stage) and desired outcomes (such as crop yield). Once trained, these algorithms
    can make predictions on new data, which can be used to optimize agricultural practices
    and improve crop yields.


    The random forest algorithm is an ensemble algorithm that creates a multitude
    of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data. The algorithm
    then makes predictions by combining the predictions of all the individual trees.


    The authors argue that random forest algorithms are well-suited for precision
    agriculture because they are able to handle large datasets, are robust to noise
    and outliers, and can provide feature importance, which can be used to identify
    the most important factors influencing crop yields.

    In this outline point, the focus is on using machine learning models such as LSTM,
    CNN, and ensemble methods to generate precise, site-specific irrigation recommendations.
    This involves training these models on historical data to learn the complex relationships
    between various factors (e.g., weather, soil conditions, crop water needs) and
    irrigation outcomes. The trained models can then be used to predict optimal irrigation
    schedules for different crops and growing conditions, considering factors such

    - Khandani and Kalantari (2009): This paper proposes a methodology for determining
    the optimal spatial sampling of soil moisture sensors in a wireless sensor network.
    The methodology uses a historical database of dense soil-moisture measurements
    to determine the spatial correlation function that exists between the measurements
    of nearby sensors. This information can then be used to determine the largest
    spatial sampling that ensures a user-defined variance for the estimation of soil
    moisture at any given point of interest in the space.

  explanation: This study utilizes advanced predictive models, namely Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to accurately forecast
    soil moisture dynamics in various soil types based on historical soil moisture,
    precipitation, and climatic data. The proposed models outperform traditional feedforward

  data_sources: null
  explanation: "In this work, the authors propose an optimized CNN-based intrusion\
    \ detection system (IDS) for smart farming environments. The proposed approach\
    \ leverages deep learning techniques and feature engineering to effectively detect\
    \ attacks in smart farming networks. The key points of the paper are as follows:\n\
    \n1. **Problem Statement**: Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly prevalent in\
    \ smart farming systems, posing significant threats to agricultural productivity\
    \ and food security. Existing IDS solutions often fail to address the challenges\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming networks, such as data imbalance, high dimensionality,\
    \ and real-time constraints.\n\n2. **Proposed Approach**: The authors propose\
    \ an optimized CNN-based IDS that addresses the limitations of existing approaches.\
    \ Their approach consists of several key components:\n    - **Data Preprocessing**:\
    \ The raw NSL-KDD dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical\
    \ features to numerical, and address data imbalance using the SMOTE technique.\n\
    \    - **Feature Selection**: Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is employed\
    \ to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and select the most discriminative\
    \ features for intrusion detection.\n    - **Tabular Transformation into Images**:\
    \ The preprocessed data is transformed into images to make it suitable for CNN\
    \ models. This transformation involves normalizing the data and converting data\
    \ chunks into square color images.\n    - **CNN Classification**: Three different\
    \ CNN models (VGG16, Xception, and Inception) are applied to the transformed images\
    \ for intrusion detection. The models are fine-tuned and optimized using a particle\
    \ swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to enhance their performance.\n\n3. **Evaluation**:\
    \ The proposed IDS is evaluated using the NSL-KDD dataset, a standard benchmark\
    \ for intrusion detection research. The results demonstrate that the optimized\
    \ VGG16 model outperforms the baseline CNN models and achieves a high accuracy\
    \ of 99.99%, a precision of 0.9999, a recall of 0.9999, and an F1 score of 1.0.\n\
    \n4. **Significance**: The proposed approach provides several advantages over\
    \ existing IDS solutions for smart farming. It effectively addresses data imbalance,\
    \ dimensionality reduction, and real-time constraints. Additionally, the use of\
    \ CNN models and PSO optimization contributes to the high accuracy and robustness\
    \ of the IDS.\n\nIt is important to note that the proposed approach focuses on\
    \ identifying known attack patterns based on the NSL-KDD dataset. While it provides\
    \ a strong foundation for intrusion detection in smart farming, further research\
    \ is needed to address evolving and novel attack techniques in real-world scenarios."

- explanation: RMSE stands for Root Mean Square Error, which is a measure of the difference
    between predicted values and observed values. It provides an indication of the
    accuracy of the model's predictions, with lower values indicating better accuracy.
    RMSE is highly sensitive to outliers, which are data points that are significantly
    different from the rest of the data. High RMSE indicates that the predictions
    are widely scattered around the true values, either being overestimated or underestimated.
    In this context, an RMSE of 3.25 mm/day implies that the predicted evapotranspiration
    rates deviate from the true values by an average of 3.25 mm/day, suggesting a
    relatively high level of uncertainty in the model's predictions.
  relevance_evaluation: The explanation adequately defines RMSE and highlights its
    significance in evaluating model accuracy. It also provides a clear and concise
    interpretation of an RMSE value in the context of evapotranspiration rate prediction,
    emphasizing the deviation between predicted and observed values. However, it could
    benefit from an additional example or further elaboration to illustrate how RMSE
    is calculated and how it relates to the model's overall performance.

    1 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract The crop coefficient (Kc) is a scaling
    factor to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Accurate prediction of Kc affects
    planning to allocate water resources, especially in arid and semi-arid areas with
    limited water sources availability. The conventional FAO approach has some limited
    applications due to using plant characteristics. However, existing artificial
    intelligence approaches have high performances, but encounter some instability
    in prediction. In the present study, the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation
    (GLUE) approach was applied to assess uncertainties arising from both model structure
    and input parameters. In addition, this study aims to derive the explicit predictive
    and usable equation for calculating the monthly Kc of maize. The equations were
    developed from the best hybrid MLP model using minimal meteorological data in
    four regions of Egypt. For this, the predictive utility of MLP-based models that
    hybridized with meta-heuristic optimization algorithms was examined. The rat swarm
    optimization (RSO), firefly algorithm (FFA), bat algorithm (BA), and genetic algorithm
    (GA) hybridized with MLP (MLP-RSO, MLP-FFA, MLP-BA, and MLP-GA) are used as equation
    derivation tools. The results showed that a unique hybrid Gamma Test-RSO is a
    powerful approach for determining the optimal combination (Tmax, Tmin, Rs) as
    the best input vector. The results showed that the hybrid MLP-RSO model decreased
    the average RMSE by 13.87, 39.95, 45.68, and 53.09% than MLP-BA, MLP-FFA, MLP-GA,
    and MLP models, respectively. In addition, the uncertainty results showed that
    the Kc predictions were more stable and confident in MLP-RSO, while the average
    of 95PPU covered 94.5 and 91.5% of actual Kc for input parameters and model structure
    uncertainties, respectively. In conclusion, the developed hybrid model and the
    techniques illustrated in the current study suggest substantial benefits for other
    researchers to derive mathematical equations from easily available meteorological
    variables in different regions and climates. Also, the findings provide a fundamental
    guideline for the local water users and agricultural development planners to achieve
    accurate and fast irrigation scheduling.'

  explanation: 'The current study focuses on utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep
    learning (DL) algorithms to develop advanced predictive models for precise, site-specific
    irrigation recommendations. Specifically, the authors investigate the application
    of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random
    Forest (RF), as well as a hybrid CNN-RF model, to generate real-time irrigation
    insights based on soil properties. They assess these models'' performance against
    various evaluation metrics and provide a detailed analysis of the effectiveness
    of each model for the specific point of focus within the larger literature review
    on automated irrigation systems.


    The study demonstrates the higher accuracy of the hybrid CNN-RF model for predicting
    soil properties, including clay, sand, and silt content, compared to stand-alone
    CNN and RF models. The authors attribute this enhanced performance to the hybrid
    model''s ability to extract relevant features from raw data using convolutional
    layers and its subsequent utilization of the RF algorithm for regression analysis.
    They provide a comprehensive comparison of the models'' performance, including
    evaluation metrics, box plots, and Taylor diagrams, to support their findings.'

    Abstract—On one hand, the emergence of cutting-edge tech-

    nologies like AI, Cloud Computing, and IoT holds immense

    potential in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. These

    technologies enable real-time data collection, including high-

    resolution crop imagery, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

    Leveraging these advancements can revolutionize agriculture by

    facilitating faster decision-making, cost reduction, and increased

    yields. Such progress aligns with precision agriculture principles,

    optimizing practices for the right locations, times, and quantities.

    On the other hand, integrating UAVs in Smart Farming faces

    obstacles related to technology selection and deployment, par-

    ticularly in data acquisition and image processing. The relative

    novelty of UAV utilization in Precision Agriculture contributes to

    the lack of standardized workflows. Consequently, the widespread

    adoption and implementation of UAV technologies in farming

    practices are hindered. This paper addresses these challenges by

    conducting a comprehensive review of recent UAV applications

    in Precision Agriculture. It explores common applications, UAV

    types, data acquisition techniques, and image processing methods

    to provide a clear understanding of each technology’s advantages

    and limitations. By gaining insights into the advantages and

    challenges associated with UAV-based applications in Precision

    Agriculture, this study aims to contribute to the development

    of standardized workflows and improve the adoption of UAV

    technologies.

    INTRODUCTION

    The agriculture industry is currently undergoing a sig-

    nificant transformation fueled by cutting-edge technologies,

    offering promising prospects for enhanced farm productivity

    and profitability. Precision Agriculture, which focuses on the

    precise application of inputs where and when they are needed,

    represents the third stage of the modern agricultural revolution.

    Advanced farm knowledge systems, empowered by the abun-

    dance of data, have further propelled the evolution of Preci-

    sion Agriculture [1]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the

    positive impacts of adopting Precision Agriculture technolo-

    gies, such as increased net returns and operating profits, as

    reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2].

    Moreover, there is a growing emphasis on implementing these

    technologies in environmentally conscious ways to ensure

    sustainable farm production. However, effectively harnessing

    the vast amount of data generated by crops remains a persistent

    challenge [3].

    To address these challenges, it is crucial to explore and

    integrate cutting-edge technologies in the realm of Smart

    Farming and Precision Agriculture. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

    (UAVs), Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data

    analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as key

    enablers of innovation in this domain [4]. UAVs equipped with

    advanced sensors and imaging capabilities allow for real-time

    data collection, including high-resolution imagery of crops.

    Cloud Computing provides the infrastructure for data storage,

    processing, and analysis, while IoT facilitates the seamless

    integration of various agricultural devices and sensors. Big

    Data analytics and AI techniques enable intelligent insights

    and decision-making based on the collected data [5], [6].

    This paper aims to delve into the theoretical background

    and related work of UAV, Cloud, IoT, Big Data, and AI

    approaches in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. Ad-

    ditionally, authors propose a comprehensive systematic review

    study that investigates the current state of research and de-

    velopment in this area. By analyzing existing literature, in

    order to identify the gaps, challenges, and opportunities for

    utilizing these technologies in the context of Smart Farming

    and Precision Agriculture, Fig. 1, depicted below, offers valu-

    able insights into the evolution characteristics and challenges

    of agricultural development, spanning from Farming 1.0 to

    Farming 5.0. This figure serves as a valuable tool to showcase

    the effective utilization and evolution of technologies within

    the realms of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. The

    problem statement of this study revolves around the lack

    of a standardized framework for leveraging UAVs, Cloud

    Computing, IoT, Big Data, and AI in Smart Farming and

    Precision Agriculture. This lack of standardization hinders the

    widespread adoption and implementation of these technolo-

    gies, limiting their potential benefits for farmers, agricultural

    productivity, and sustainable practices. To address this prob-

    lem, our proposed solution is to conduct a systematic review

    that synthesizes existing research, identifies key insights, and

    provides recommendations for the development of standard-

    ized frameworks and practices in this field.

    The motivation behind this work stems from the immense

    potential of integrating UAVs, Cloud Computing, IoT, Big Data

    analytics, and AI in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    By leveraging these technologies effectively, farmers can make

    faster and more informed decisions, reduce costs, optimize

    resource utilization, and increase yields. Moreover, this inte-

    gration aligns with the growing demand for sustainable farming

    practices and the need to meet the rising global food demands.

    The contribution of this paper lies in the comprehensive review

    of existing literature, which consolidates knowledge, identifies

    research gaps, and proposes recommendations for the future

    development of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    BACKGROUND

    A. Unnamed Aerial Vehicles for Agriculture

    Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), also known as drones,

    have become increasingly popular in agriculture due to their

    ability to provide a quick, cost-effective and efficient way to

    gather data and perform tasks on large fields and crops [7].

    UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) indeed come in different

    types and can be equipped with a variety of sensors and

    cameras presented in Fig. 2 that can capture high-resolution

    images, aerial maps and thermal imagery, which can be used

    for a range of agriculture applications, including:

    •

    Crop monitoring: UAS can be used to gather real-time

    data on crop health, growth, and yield potential.

    •

    Irrigation management: Drones can be equipped with

    infrared cameras to identify areas that are in need of

    irrigation and to help optimize water use.

    •

    Pest and disease management: Drones can be used

    to detect and map the spread of pests and diseases in

    crops, helping farmers to take timely action to prevent

    or treat these issues.

    •

    Field mapping: UAS can produce high-resolution

    maps of fields, providing data on soil structure, to-

    pography, and plant populations, which can be used to

    make informed decisions about planting, fertilization

    and other aspects of crop management.

    •

    Livestock management: Drones can be used to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock, as well as to keep

    track of the location of animals.

    Overall, the use of UAS in agriculture provides a new tool for

    farmers to gather data, monitor their crops and make more

    informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved yields,

    increased efficiency and reduced costs.

    B. Cloud, Internet of Things, Big data and IA

    1) Cloud: computing plays a crucial role in smart farming,

    which is an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in

    agriculture. The cloud enables farmers to store, process, and

    analyze large amounts of data generated from various IoT

    devices and sensors on their farms [9]. This data can include

    information on weather patterns, soil moisture levels, crop

    growth, and even the health of livestock. By analyzing this data

    in real-time, farmers can make more informed decisions about

    crop management and animal husbandry, leading to increased

    productivity and efficiency.

    Additionally, cloud-based solutions can provide farmers

    with access to advanced algorithms and predictive analytics

    tools that can help them optimize their farming operations.

    For example, cloud-based machine learning models can predict

    UAV, Sensing UAV) [8].

    crop yields, identify pest infestations, and suggest the most

    appropriate treatments. Furthermore, the cloud allows farmers

    to monitor their farms remotely and receive real-time updates

    on conditions and activities.

    2) Internet of Things: The concept of the Internet of Things

    (IoT) pertains to a network comprising physical devices,

    vehicles, appliances, and various objects. These entities are

    equipped with sensors, software, and connectivity features that

    empower them to gather and exchange data via the internet.

    These connected devices can communicate and interact with

    each other, as well as with humans, creating a vast ecosystem

    of interconnected systems [10]. The IoT has the potential to

    revolutionize various sectors, including agriculture, healthcare,

    transportation, smart homes, and many others, by enabling

    increased automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-

    making. In smart farming, IoT is used to gather real-time data

    from various sources such as weather stations, soil moisture

    sensors, and crop and animal monitoring systems.

    IoT devices and sensors in smart farming can range from

    simple weather sensors to more complex systems such as pre-

    cision agriculture systems that use Global Positioning System

    (GPS) to monitor the growth and health of crops. These devices

    can also be connected to irrigation systems, allowing farmers

    to control the amount of water they use based on real-time

    soil moisture levels. One of the key benefits of IoT in smart

    farming is that it enables farmers to make data-driven decisions

    in real-time. This leads to more efficient use of resources and

    improved crop yields. IoT also enables farmers to monitor their

    farms remotely, reducing the need for on-site visits and freeing

    up more time for other tasks.

    In addition to its direct benefits, IoT in smart farming

    can also help address important global challenges such as

    food security and sustainability [11]. By using technology to

    optimize their operations, farmers can produce more food using

    fewer resources, reducing their carbon footprint and helping to

    ensure that future generations have access to safe and healthy

    food. Overall, the Internet of Things is revolutionizing the way

    farming is done and is poised to play a crucial role in the future

    of agriculture.

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are networks of small,

    low-cost, and low-power devices that can be used to monitor

    and collect data from the environment [12]. These devices,

    called “nodes”, are equipped with sensors, microcontrollers,

    and wireless communication capabilities, allowing them to

    transmit data wirelessly to a central location for analysis.

    WSNs are widely used in a variety of applications, in-

    cluding smart farming, where they are used to monitor soil

    moisture, temperature, light, and other environmental param-

    eters that affect crop growth [13]. The data collected by the

    sensor nodes can be used to make informed decisions about

    irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices, leading

    to increased efficiency and higher crop yields.

    One of the key benefits of WSNs is that they are low-cost

    and easy to deploy, making them accessible to farmers of all

    sizes and resources. They are also scalable, allowing farmers

    to add more nodes as their needs grow [14]. Finally, a review

    of 77 research papers published between 2012 and 2022 on

    the implementation of IoT in various agricultural applications

    showed that roughly 16% focused on precision agriculture

    and the same percentage on irrigation monitoring. 13% of

    the papers delved into soil monitoring, while temperature and

    animal monitoring were each covered in 11% of the research.

    Air and disease monitoring each received 5% of attention, with

    water monitoring accounting for 7%. Fertilization monitoring

    was the least studied, with only 4% of the research papers

    devoted to it in [15].

    C. Big Data

    Big Data plays a significant role in the context of smart

    farming. Smart farming involves the application of advanced

    technologies, such as sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) de-

    vices, and data analytics, to enhance agricultural practices and

    decision-making processes [16]. These technologies generate

    vast amounts of data from various sources, including weather

    conditions, soil moisture levels, crop health indicators, and

    machinery performance.

    1152 | P a g e

    IJACSA-International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,

    Vol. 14, No. 6, 2023

    Big Data analytics allows for the collection, storage, pro-

    cessing, and analysis of large volumes of agricultural data in

    real-time or near-real-time. By applying advanced analytics

    techniques, such as machine learning and predictive model-

    ing, valuable insights can be extracted from this data. These

    insights can help optimize farming practices, improve resource

    allocation, enhance crop yield, and enable more informed

    decision-making for farmers and agricultural stakeholders [17].

    Furthermore, Big Data analytics can enable predictive capa-

    bilities in smart farming. By leveraging historical data and

    machine learning algorithms, models can be developed to

    forecast disease outbreaks, pests infestation, crop yield, and

    market demand. These predictive insights empower farmers to

    make proactive decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize resource

    allocation. In summary, the integration of Big Data analyt-

    ics in smart farming allows for data-driven decision-making,

    optimization of agricultural practices, and the potential for

    increased productivity, sustainability, and profitability in the

    agriculture industry [18], [19].

    D. Artificial Intelligence

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses the creation of

    computer systems capable of executing tasks typically requir-

    ing human intelligence, including pattern recognition, predic-

    tion, and learning from experience. In smart farming, AI is

    used to automate various processes and make more informed

    decisions [16]. One of the key applications of AI in smart

    farming is precision agriculture, where AI algorithms are used

    to analyze data from various sources, such as weather stations

    and sensors, to determine the best practices for growing crops.

    For example, AI can be used to optimize irrigation and fer-

    tilization practices, leading to increased efficiency and higher

    yields. AI can also be used in animal husbandry to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock. Also, AI algorithms can

    be used to detect signs of illness in animals, such as changes

    in their heart rate or behavior, and alert farmers to take action.

    Another application of AI in smart farming is in the detection

    and control of pests and diseases. AI algorithms can be used to

    analyze images of crops and detect signs of pests or diseases,

    allowing farmers to take proactive measures to address them. In

    conclusion, AI is a valuable tool in the development of smart

    farming, enabling farmers to make more informed decisions

    and automate various processes [20]. By using AI, farmers can

    improve efficiency, increase yields, and reduce waste, making

    a valuable contribution to the future of agriculture. However,

    it’s important to note that while AI has the potential to greatly

    benefit the agriculture industry; it also presents challenges,

    such as the need for large amounts of data and the potential

    for bias in algorithms. Thus, it’s important to approach the

    integration of AI in smart farming with caution and a focus

    on ethical and sustainable practices.

    METHODOLOGY

    In recent years, the academic community has extensively

    analyzed numerous works related to smart farming develop-

    ment from various perspectives. For instance, [21] introduced a

    systematic review focusing on precision farming. Then, authors

    in [22] provided a review on technologies in precision agricul-

    ture, highlighting innovations, technologies, and applications.

    Also, authors in [23] explored the use of big data on smart

    farming, emphasizing the primary opportunities and challenges

    associated with this technology. Additionally, [24] conducted a

    quantitative literature review, offering an overview of academic

    production in smart farming.

    In order to enhance the existing analyses, the present

    study seeks to conduct a comprehensive review of UAV based

    applications in the field of smart farming. To accomplish this

    objective, we employed the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) methodology [25], a frame-

    work specifically designed to facilitate literature reports and

    systematic reviews. In October 2022, authors conducted a

    search using the available search tool on the Scopus database

    website. Additionally, another search was performed in april

    2023 within the same database to include papers published

    in the year 2023. Scopus was selected due to its exten-

    sive coverage and relevance in similar bibliographic reviews

    mentioned in [24] and [26]. Our search strategy focused

    on terms related to technological applications in agriculture,

    such as “Precision Agriculture,” “Precision Farming,” “Smart

    Farming,” and “Smart Agriculture,” in conjunction with “UAV”

    and related terms. The publication date of articles was not a

    basis for exclusion. However, we restricted our research scope

    to journal and conference articles published in English. To

    ensure methodological rigor, this systematic review adhered to

    the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), with the

    most recent version being 2020. In Table I, you will find a

    compilation of the research questions (RQ) that the Systematic

    Literature Review (SLR) aims to address.

    In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) was

    conducted to assess recent research papers on the use of IoT,

    Big data, Cloud & AI techniques in the field of Smart farm-

    ing. However, advancements in technology and the increasing

    availability of digital resources have led to the development of

    new systematic review process, but the traditional systematic

    literature review methodology remains the standard approach

    for conducting systematic reviews, new tools and techniques

    are emerging that can enhance the process and provide addi-

    tional benefits to researchers and decision-makers. However,

    it is important to consider the limitations of these new ap-

    proaches and to ensure that the results of the systematic review

    remain reliable and trustworthy. The following are the steps

    involved in the systematic literature review methodology: In

    this context, lookup has produced a plethora of SLR standards

    that should be observed to reap tremendous empirical research.

    In this paper, we concentrate on the SLR guidelines proposed

    by authors in [19], which can be classified into the following

    categories. There are four steps:

    •

    Step 1: Identifying the research goal(s).

    •

    Step 2: Research subject framing (conceptual bound-

    aries).

    •

    Step 3: Using inclusion/exclusion criteria to collect

    data.

    •

    Step 4: Validation of the research findings is the fourth

    step.

    B. Framing of the Research Subject

    The goal of this study is to evaluate Big Data, Cloud,

    internet of things, artificial intelligence technologies for Smart

    Farming in a systematic way. As a result, the research subject,

    i.e. the conceptual boundaries, were defined in the agriculture

    environment using the terms “Unnamed Aerial Vehicle”, “Big

    Data”, “Cloud”, “internet of things”, “artificial intelligence”

    and related concepts “machine learning” and “deep learning.”

    The following Table II displays the Inclusion and exclusion

    criteria identified to refine the search request.

    C. Data Collection by Using Criteria

    A definition of search parameters, databases, search key-

    words, and publication time is also required by the SLR.

    The selection of search resources and the choice of search

    phrases are both part of the search strategy. To find the papers,

    automated search engine from the most relevant sources were

    chosen: Scopus. A further examination of similar databases

    (ACM Digital Library and Emerald) revealed significant vari-

    ations in the research studies that resulted. As a result, Scopus

    was used as the primary database for secondary data evaluation

    in this research study. The systematic research approach [24]

    and the inclusion and exclusion criterias, which are based on

    the process query depicted in Fig. 3.

    Screening the article title, abstract, and keywords for rele-

    vant literature for Blockchain, IoT and AI in the subject areas

    of management was the first step. We included a variety of

    document formats in this stage and limited them to the English

    language. This first method was mostly utilized to obtain a

    sense of where research was at the time. As a result, the study

    was not limited intialy to a specific period. In total, 536 studies

    were found as a result of this method. We concentrated on

    studies in the areas of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture

    in the second step. As a consequence, we narrowed down

    the previously identified 536 publications to 186 papers that

    contained the terms Smart Farming or Precision Agriculture.

    that did not meet the exclusion criteria outlined in Table II.

    As a result, 80 papers were identified as the basis for the

    further research process. It is important to note that quotation

    marks are used to ensure that multi-word terms are searched

    together, preventing individual words from being considered

    separately. After conducting the search, the resulting articles

    were manually reviewed by analyzing their titles, keywords,

    abstracts, and texts. Duplicate articles were eliminated, and

    the remaining articles were assessed to determine whether

    they were relevant to the study’s objectives. Valid articles

    were those that focused on IoT-based solutions for agricultural

    problems, were not literature reviews, were written in English,

    Portuguese, or Spanish, and pertained to agriculture rather than

    livestock activities. The study’s search and selection process is

    summarized in Fig. 4. The initial search yielded 536 articles,

    which were then analyzed and narrowed down to 186 articles

    that met the study’s eligibility criteria. During the screening

    phase, 350 articles were deemed invalid and discarded based on

    their lack of relevance to the study’s objectives. Of these, 65%

    did not focus on smart farming. Additionally, almost 35% of

    the discarded papers were literature reviews or studies related

    to smart farming that did not involve IoT. A small number

    of papers pertained to smart farming but did not address IoT

    (about 5% were related to sensors), and some papers had

    abstracts or texts that were not available (about 2%).

    In the eligibility phase, the content of the 80 remaining

    articles was reviewed using the same criteria as in the screening

    phase. Of these, 23 articles were discarded, with 27% not

    related to IoT and 32% not to smart farming. The remain-

    ing 41% were literature reviews or papers without available

    content. This research analysis conducted in 57 articles that

    were eligible for inclusion in the study’s sample.

    A. Description Analysis

    57 papers were ultimately assigned to the topic and rated as

    relevant for deep analysis, out of a total of 536 papers that had

    been previously identified regarding the application of Cloud,

    Big Data, IoT, AI, within UAV Application in Smart Farming.

    The distribution of the selected studies’ suitability, which was

    assessed by reading their titles and abstracts, the distribution

    of articles published per year is shown in Fig. 5, then the

    distribution of documents per year per source is provided

    in Fig. 6 and finally the Fig. 7 describe the distribution of

    documents by appropriateness.

    The decrease in research on the application of drones in

    precision agriculture may be multiple and dependent on vari-

    ous factors such as funding, research priorities, technological

    advancements, etc. However, some possible hypotheses can

    be suggested: Recent technological advancements may have

    solved a significant portion of the issues related to drone

    application in precision agriculture, thereby reducing the need

    for further research in this field. Funding for research in this

    field may have been reduced or directed towards other research

    areas. The scientific community may be transitioning to other

    agricultural monitoring technologies or methods, such as the

    use of remote sensors or satellites. It is also possible that the

    number of scientific publications on the subject has decreased,

    but research is still ongoing in other contexts as provided in

    the distribution of document by subject area provided in Fig.

    8, such as in the private industry. Ultimately, it is important to

    realize that the decrease in research in a given field does not

    necessarily imply that research should be abandoned or that

    previous results are no longer relevant. Existing research can

    still be used to improve existing applications and guide future

    research.

    Out of the 166 full texts in the field of smart farming

    that were found, 96 papers (58%) were rated as having high

    appropriateness, 53 papers (32%) as having medium appropri-

    ateness, and 17 papers (10%) as having low appropriateness in

    relation to the goal of this research project. Book chapters are

    of total of 21%, while research articles are 44%, and reviews

    are 23%.

    Based on the 166 complete articles that were found, Fig.

    8 displays the distribution of document types in the field of

    smart farming by subject area.

    B. Content Analysis

    The complete texts of the papers were reviewed and iden-

    tified in this section. Table IV summarizes the most important

    clusters, primary references, to group the chosen literature into

    related clusters, we engaged in a thorough content analysis.

    In addition Table V complete this set of research documents

    by UAV articles analyzed by characteristics and limitations

    identified in the survey.

    IoT (Internet of Things) technology is transforming the

    agricultural industry by enabling farmers to collect and an-

    alyze data from various sources to make informed decisions.

    However, like any technology, IoT also presents challenges and

    issues, particularly in the context of smart farming. Table VI

    provides a comparison of IoT issues and challenges in smart

    farming:

    RQ1. WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF UAVS

    IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE?

    The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud technol-

    ogy in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has brought about

    significant improvements in smart farming. Here are some of

    the impacts:

    •

    Soil Analysis: UAVs can be used to collect soil

    samples, analyze soil moisture levels, and assess soil

    quality, which can help farmers optimize fertilization

    and irrigation practices.

    •

    Planting: UAVs can be used to plant seeds precisely

    and efficiently, reducing labor costs and increasing

    planting accuracy. Crop spraying: UAVs equipped

    with spraying systems can be used to apply pesticides,

    herbicides, and fertilizers accurately, reducing the en-

    RQ2. WHICH CROPS ARE MONITORED BY UAV

    SYSTEMS?

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly

    being used for crop monitoring and management in agriculture.

    Various types of crops can be monitored using UAV systems,

    including different Cereals. These crops are often monitored

    for growth stages, yield prediction, and disease detection [63].

    Fruits and vegetables: Such as grapes, citrus, apples, tomatoes,

    and potatoes. UAV systems can monitor the growth and health

    of these crops, detect pests and diseases, and assess yield.

    Oilseeds: Such as soybeans, sunflowers, and canola. UAV

    systems can be used to monitor crop growth, assess the health

    of plants, and predict yields. Specialty crops: Such as coffee,

    tea, cocoa, and tobacco. UAV systems can help monitor the

    health of these crops, detect early signs of disease or pest

    using unmanned aerial ve-

    hicle (UAV) imagery

    This paper proposes a framework

    that integrates UAVs with IoT and

    cloud computing for smart agricul-

    ture. The authors demonstrate the

    feasibility of the proposed frame-

    work through a case study. They

    conclude that the proposed frame-

    work can improve crop yield and

    reduce costs for farmers.

    The authors primarily focus on the

    challenges associated with imple-

    menting UAV-based systems, rather

    than discussing potential solutions

    or strategies for overcoming these

    challenges. While this is an im-

    portant aspect to consider, a more

    detailed analysis of potential solu-

    tions or strategies could be useful

    for practitioners and researchers in

    the field.

    posed system through experiments.

    They conclude that the proposed

    system can accurately monitor crop

    growth and help farmers make in-

    formed decisions.

    The authors used a greenhouse to

    conduct their experiments, which

    may not accurately reflect the chal-

    lenges and limitations of imple-

    menting a UAV-based crop moni-

    toring system in an outdoor agri-

    cultural environment.

    The authors used only one type

    of UAV (a DJI Phantom 4 Pro

    drone) for their experiments. Dif-

    ferent types of UAVs have differ-

    ent capabilities, such as flight time,

    payload capacity, and camera qual-

    ity, which could impact the effec-

    tiveness and accuracy of a UAV-

    based weed detection system.

    infestations, and optimize harvest. While the use of UAV

    systems for crop monitoring has several advantages, there

    are also some limitations to the types of crops that can

    be effectively monitored. Here are some of the limitations

    collected by analyzing the following articles [64], [65], [66].

    So, there are several limitations to using UAVs for crop

    monitoring. Firstly, UAVs can only cover a limited area in

    a single flight, which makes it difficult to monitor large farms

    efficiently. Secondly, UAVs are affected by weather conditions

    and may not be able to fly in adverse weather, which can

    impact data collection. Thirdly, UAVs require skilled operators

    and specialized equipment, which can be costly and time-

    consuming to maintain. Then, regulations around the use of

    UAVs can be complex and vary between countries, which can

    add another layer of complexity to their use in crop monitoring.

    These limitations must be carefully considered when deciding

    whether to use UAVs for crop monitoring and when planning

    a UAV-based monitoring program.

    In conclusion, while UAV systems can be an effective tool

    for crop monitoring, there are limitations to the types of crops

    that can be effectively monitored. Crop height, density, size,

    weather conditions, and sensor limitations are all factors that

    data.

    Overall, UAVs can capture a wide range of data types,

    which can be used for various applications in fields such as

    agriculture, environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspec-

    tion, and disaster response.

    RQ5. WHICH METHODS OF DATA PROCESSING CAN BE

    EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE AGRICULTURAL DATA

    COLLECTED BY UAVS?

    culture can be processed and analyzed using various techniques

    to extract valuable information about crop health, yield, and

    soil properties. These techniques include image processing,

    GIS, multispectral data analysis, machine learning, and 3D

    modeling.

    RQ6. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

    USING DRONES FOR DISEASE DETECTION IN

    AGRICULTURE?

    The challenges can be categorized into two primary

    groups: dataset-related challenges and model-building chal-

    lenges. Dataset-related challenges encompass deformations in

    the image dataset, insufficient availability of expert-labeled

    data, significant randomness in the data, and inadequate repre-

    sentation of classes in the dataset. Challenges associated with

    model building are the scarcity of training samples, extended

    training and processing times. Out of the papers analyzed, only

    two proposed potential solutions for these difficulties. The use

    of UAV in smart farming has become increasingly popular

    due to their ability to collect vast amounts of data quickly

    and accurately. However, the integration of Internet of Things

    (IoT) technologies into UAV applications also brings unique

    challenges and issues. The Table VI provides a comparison

    of the key challenges and issues related to IoT in UAV

    applications for smart farming.

    RQ7. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL

    IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF DRONES

    IN AGRICULTURE, AND HOW CAN THESE ISSUES BE

    ADDRESSED?

    The use of drones in agriculture presents various ethical

    and legal implications that need to be considered and ad-

    dressed. From an ethical standpoint, privacy concerns arise

    as drones can capture sensitive information about individuals

    or their properties. There is also the potential for drones to

    infringe on airspace regulations, endangering other aircraft

    or public safety. Furthermore, the automation and autonomy

    of drones raise questions about accountability and liability

    in case of accidents or damage caused by these devices. To

    address these issues, several measures can be implemented.

    Firstly, clear regulations and guidelines should be established

    regarding the operation of drones in agricultural settings. These

    regulations should address aspects such as flight restrictions,

    licensing requirements, and privacy protection. Adequate en-

    forcement mechanisms should be in place to ensure compli-

    ance.

    Secondly, public awareness campaigns and education ini-

    tiatives can inform both farmers and the general public about

    the responsible and legal use of drones in agriculture. This can

    help foster understanding and mitigate privacy concerns. Addi-

    tionally, technological solutions can be developed to enhance

    privacy protection, such as implementing geofencing mecha-

    nisms that restrict drone access to certain areas or utilizing

    data anonymization techniques. Collaboration between stake-

    holders, including farmers, drone operators, regulatory bodies,

    and legal experts, is crucial for developing comprehensive

    guidelines and frameworks that address the ethical and legal

    implications of drone use in agriculture. Regular review and

    updates of regulations can also ensure they remain relevant

    as technology evolves. Ultimately, a balanced approach is

    needed that considers the benefits of drone technology in

    agriculture while safeguarding privacy, public safety, and legal

    compliance.

    DISCUSSIONS

    The reason to conduct this systematic review on UAV-

    based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and cloud

    technologies is to provide a comprehensive overview of the

    current state-of-the-art in this field. This review aims to gather

    and analyze existing research studies, to identify gaps in the

    literature, and to provide insights into the potential of these

    technologies for smart farming.

    The systematic review will contribute to the research field

    in several ways. Firstly, it will provide a clear understanding

    of the current state-of-the-art in UAV-based applications in

    smart farming, including the various applications, benefits,

    and challenges associated with the use of these technologies.

    Secondly, it will identify gaps in the literature and areas where

    further research is needed. This will help researchers to focus

    their efforts on areas that are most promising and where further

    advancements are needed. Thirdly, it will provide insights into

    the potential of these technologies to transform the agriculture

    industry, promote sustainable farming practices, and address

    global food security challenges.

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies face several data challenges that must

    be addressed for successful implementation. These challenges

    include acquiring and efficiently storing the large amounts of

    data generated by UAVs, ensuring the quality and reliability

    of the data, processing and analyzing the data in real-time

    using AI and cloud technologies, seamlessly integrating the

    UAV-based applications with other systems, and ensuring

    data privacy and security. Overcoming these challenges will

    require the development of robust data management strategies,

    advanced algorithms for data analysis, secure and interoperable

    systems, and effective policies and regulations for data privacy

    and security. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for

    the successful implementation of UAV-based applications in

    smart farming and the realization of their potential benefits for

    the agricultural industry. Meteorological conditions can have a

    significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart farming

    that use AI, IoT, and cloud technologies. For example, wind

    speed and direction can affect the stability and maneuverability

    of the UAV, which can impact the quality of the data collected.

    Similarly, rain, fog, and low-light conditions can affect the

    quality of the images and sensor readings collected by the

    UAV, which can impact the accuracy of the data analysis.

    Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, thunder-

    storms, and blizzards can also pose safety risks for the UAV

    and the personnel operating it. High winds, lightning, and

    heavy precipitation can damage the UAV or cause it to crash,

    while snow and ice can affect its mobility and stability. To mit-

    igate the impact of meteorological conditions on UAV-based

    applications in smart farming, it is important to have reliable

    weather forecasting systems in place. This can help farmers

    and operators plan UAV flights around weather patterns, avoid-

    ing unsafe conditions and optimizing data collection.

    Additionally, it is important to use UAVs equipped with

    weather-resistant sensors and cameras that can operate in a

    range of environmental conditions. This can help ensure the

    accuracy and reliability of the data collected, even in adverse

    weather conditions. In summary, meteorological conditions can

    have a significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart

    farming, and it is important to have reliable weather forecasting

    systems and weather-resistant equipment to mitigate these

    effects.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today.

    By validating and comparing the PRISMA (Preferred Re-

    porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

    results with the presented objectives, scenarios, and analysis

    criteria in Table VII, this systematic review aims to enhance the

    existing survey methodology. It strives to provide an updated

    research review based on established guidelines, which can

    have several advantages. So, by employing a validated method-

    ology and adhering to established guidelines like PRISMA, this

    work aims to provide a reliable, transparent, and up-to-date

    resource that can contribute to the existing body of knowledge

    in UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. Despite the numerous benefits associated

    with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT, and cloud technologies in smart

    farming, there are still some limitations and challenges that

    need to be addressed in the future. One of the main limitations

    is the high cost of acquiring and maintaining these technolo-

    gies, which may limit their adoption by smallholder farmers.

    Another limitation is the lack of regulatory frameworks and

    policies to guide their use, particularly in developing countries.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today. Despite the

    numerous benefits associated with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies in smart farming, there are still some

    limitations and challenges that need to be addressed in the

    future.

  description: In this paper, we present a novel non-invasive water flow metering
    technique that is cheap and exhibits decent performance. Targeting mainly irrigation
    monitoring, the technique has been applied to create a prototype measuring apparatus
    consisting of a small, battery operated board that includes both a vibration and
    an acceleration sensor. Data acquired from those sensors is then processed on-board
    via a neural-network that has been pre-trained and calibrated in the lab. The
    inferred water flow rate is then transmitted via LoRaWAN to a data back-end for
    further processing. With this device, we demonstrated that for a total cost of
    less than 18 €, our prototype communicating sensor could run for a complete irrigation
    season on 2 AAA batteries with data sent every 20 minutes. Regarding the performance
    of this AI-augmented sensor, the results exhibit less than 10% of error for most
    flow rates when compared to a fully calibrated, lab-grade water flow meter, with
    potential for improvement.

    control over industrial and residential applications using IoT to suit their growing
    needs for an easy and rapid approach to solving their day-to-day activities has

    The Internet of Things'' disruption has severely impacted agricultural and farming
    industries. Compared to countries with lower mobile internet penetration, such

    IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction The disruption
    caused by the Internet of Things has significantly impacted the agricultural and
    farming industries. The IoT''s influence is restricted in nations with lower mobile
    internet penetration, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture accounts for
    10 to 50 percent of GDP. Currently, farmers examine irrigation methods manually
    and irrigate their fields regularly. These procedures need a lot of water, and
    as a result, much water is wasted [1] [2]. As a result of the inculcation of Edge
    - AI along with Intelligent IoT setup, the entire mechanism from irrigating the
    crop to yield is completely automated to make this process flow cyclically by
    making the entire mechanism from irrigating the crop to yield even by detecting
    the moisture level along with the temperature and during the occurrence of rains.
    SECTION II. Problem Formulation Farmers must return to their farms regularly to
    do tasks such as watering and fertilizing. Farmers are occasionally obliged to
    remain on their farms. When agricultural areas grow, jobs become more difficult
    to execute and require more human resources. It can lead to a significant increase
    in operating costs with little impact on production. Remote monitoring and management
    systems are one answer for these remote farms on the Internet of Things era. Smart
    farms make greater and more efficient use of Internet of Things technologies.
    Remote farm monitoring and control, on the other hand, has a limited influence
    in areas with inconsistent or poor Internet connectivity. The Internet of Things
    is used to link and communicate both virtual and physical objects.[3] Wireless
    sensors, cloud computing, and embedded intelligence are just a few technologies
    that can be used with an IoT architectural system. These systems offer an advanced
    service, such as real-time remote monitoring applications in various industries,
    including health care, smart manufacturing, smart homes, smart cities, and smart
    agriculture, as well as greater productivity and cost savings. Some of the benefits
    of the Internet of Things can be leveraged to improve the quality of automated
    and remote farming systems'' services. However, relying on traditional cloud centric
    IoT infrastructures for remote farm monitoring and management would not guarantee
    proper operation. IoT applications cannot be deployed in rural areas where the
    internet is unstable or has limited availability. Data cannot be viewed under
    such circumstances. A remote farming system based on an improved Raspberry Pi
    system with Edge assistance. The strategy is intended to reach out to isolated
    areas in developing countries where a demonstrable need exists. Edge computing
    and Raspberry Pi connectivity are proposed to overcome each other''s limitations
    while still providing intelligent services and more efficient compute distribution
    than cloud-centric alternatives. Furthermore, combining Raspberry Pi with Edge
    computing in IoT systems might help sensor nodes achieve significant energy savings.
    When some abnormalities occur, edge-assisted IoT systems can support latency-critical
    applications. SECTION III. Architecture The robotic test bed is equipped with
    a set of integrated sensors. A robotic testbed is like a breadboard in that all
    sensors are linked to one end, and data is transferred to any controller via this
    medium. The data from the robotic testbed is fed into the Raspberry Pi, which
    serves as a controller and an edge device. A web page is being constructed where
    sensordata can be monitored, readings can be observed, and the procedure may be
    automated [4] [5]. The complete process is built and operated at the farmland
    through raspberry pi, which acts as an edge device from the farm, along with the
    data as input. An IoT application was created to monitor the sensors. The depth-first
    search method automates the procedure by fixing the threshold value. The threshold
    value is used to start the procedure and then continue to automate it. The built
    web application can even monitor the threshold value. The developed web application
    also includes better security measures, which improves the user''s trustworthiness.
    The user can only access the web application using their registered credentials;
    otherwise, no one else can access it. These characteristics have also been introduced
    to the web application where the sensor data is interfaced to strengthen its security
    features. Fig 1: Architecture design of the system Show All SECTION IV. Cont Rollerboard
    and Sensors 1. Raspberry Pi Board This tool is used to automate the procedure
    at the user end as well as at the main hub station. The Raspberry Pi is utilized
    in a wide range of electrical applications, including cameras music synthesizers,
    babysitter monitoring, weather forecasts, and even tweeting birdhouses with infrared.
    [6] We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by young people across the world
    to learn how to code and how computers function. Fig2: Raspberrypi 3b+ Show All
    2. DHT11 It''s a simple digital temperature and humidity sensor that comes at
    a reasonable price. It executes the programs by using a capacitive humidity sensor
    and a thermistor to monitor the environment. Using a digital pin, the measured
    data generates a digital signal. The electrical resistance between the two electrodes
    is measured by this sensor, which estimates the relative humidity. It has a humidity
    sensor and an NTC temperature sensor thermistor on the inside. Fig3: Dht11 and
    soil moisture sensors Show All 3. EC1258 Soil Moisture The sensor has a potentiometer
    that can be used to set the desired moisture threshold. When the sensor detects
    more moisture than the predefined threshold, the digital output goes high and
    an LED signal the output. When the soil moisture is below the set threshold, the
    output remains low. The digital output can be connected to a microcontroller to
    sense the moisture level. The sensor also features an analogue output that can
    be connected to the ADC of a microcontroller to determine the precise moisture
    content of a solid. 4. EC-0569 Rain Drop Module The whole internal reflections
    principle is used by the rain sensor for finding out if it is raining or not.
    It is triggered by rain. This device attached to an automatic irrigation system
    that forces the system to turn off in the case of rainfall is one of the two principal
    applications for rain sensors. 5. LDR LDR is a small minute device when small
    amount of light is allowed to fall on its resistance varies. It facilitates the
    use of light sensor circuits by consumers. The lower in the light and increases
    in the dark when light falls on LDR. When an LDR is placed in the dark, it has
    a high resistance, and when it is maintained in the light, it has a lower resistance.

    Pump, DC 3-6V Pump for little amounts of water Miniature water circulation system
    for the garden. This is a compact, low-cost Submersible Pump Motor that can be
    powered by a 3 to 6V power supply. It can process up to 120 liters per hour while
    drawing only 220 millia mps. Fig5: Submersible mini pump Show All SECTION V. Workingprototype
    Fig6: Prototype working model Show All In the above figure the interconnection
    of sensors is made, Raspberry Pi3B+ is connected to an external T 40 pins for
    ease of use from there all the sensors are connected for collecting data and even
    supply the power source. [6] Sensors includes the Rain sensor, buzzer, LRD, Pump,
    Moisture and Temperature (DTH11). SECTION VI. Iot Architecture Fig7: Architecture
    of the io twe b model Show All For user application security, the IoT application
    is created securely [7]. The website can only be accessed by those who have the
    appropriate credentials. [8] This architecture consists of several processes,
    including a home page, a login page, and a data board page where the data can
    be monitored. The Raspberry Pi collects data from the sensors. An AI-based supervised
    learning model is used to fix the threshold value, allowing the entire application
    to be processed in an automated manner [9] [10]. SECTION VII. Algorithm Used To
    measure the performance of the model, the selection of the proper algorithm plays
    a major role. The proposed approach is to find out best possible threshold value
    based on the time of acquiring the value, so to measure the performance of any
    classification algorithm the DFS (Depth First Search) is a very essential evaluation
    algorithm. Here, we used DFS over BFS because in DFS the principle involved is
    LIFO i.e., Last in First out using stack principle. In BFS there is a chance of
    retroviral of the data, but in DFS, once if the data is traversed it is stored
    in a stack if all the search priority is completed it reallocated the memory used
    for storing the node values in the stackmaking it more memory efficient and comparatively
    DFS is fast in processing the result for the given data. As DFS has the advantages
    like, Faster Restarts and Better Reliability, Better Recovery from Failure, Improved
    File Availability, Time Complexity, and Network Efficiency, Efficient Load Balancing
    and File Location Transparency, Extended Permissions, Increased Interoperability
    and Scalability, Increased Security and Adminis trative Flexibility, so considering
    these features DFS algorithm is considered for acquiring the threshold value.
    SECTION VIII. Results The entire procedure is automated because it is based on
    a single value. When the algorithm is given live data from soil moisture, the
    algorithm collects the data and operates on it. The algorithm''s result is then
    set as a threshold value, which serves as the experiment''s driving force. The
    value of the sensor controls the operation of all other sensors. There are three
    stages to this surgery. [11] The value of the sensors is too low in the first
    stage when the submerged pump should be able to pump the water at 6v at its maximum.
    The pump enables minimal flow in the second stage, as the voltage gradually declines
    from 6 to 4.5V depending on the soil moisture value. The pump goes to 3V and finally
    switches off. Meanwhile, the Humidity and Temperature at the farm are being calculated
    every 2 seconds, and the data is being sent. The entire process takes place on
    the farmland, with the Raspberry Pi serving as the Edge device.[12] Raspberry
    Pi3B+ is connected to an external T 40 pins for ease of use; from there, all the
    sensors are connected for collecting data and even supply the power source. Sensors
    include the Rain sensor, buzzer, LRD, Pump, Moisture and Temperature (DTH11).
    The data is being processed for the application to run, and this process output,
    i.e., data from the sensors, can be monitored using the IoT -based web application,
    which involves a series of security features for protecting the access to the
    application from the cyber-attacks.[13] [14] The below images represent how the
    webpage is developed. The developed web page used HTML and JavaScript. The working
    of the HTML page is given below [15]. Fig 8: Once the user click on the url home
    page will be popped up Show All Fig 9: User need to first sign up using the credentials

    the user wants to re- login for the daily usage it is mandatory to login usingexisting

    data Show All SECTION IX. Conclusion and Future Enhancements The introduction
    of an AI system for smart farming employing Dept First Search is done in this
    study, and it is used to provide us the ideal moisture level threshold value.
    This threshold value is utilized to automate the process because the entire process
    is dependent on it; once it is fixed, all sensors receive the input voltage and
    act accordingly. This allows the sensors to carry out their normal functions and
    create outputs. The built IoT web applications allow users to safely monitor the
    sensor''s progress at the farm. As a result, the farmer can sit back and rest
    until harvest time because all his needs are met repeatedly. The web application
    is developed in such a mannerthat it requires to login for securely accessing
    the host application. The security feature can be improved in the future by using
    Gmail credentials as the primary login credentials. By experimenting with novel
    algorithms such as beam search and the A * algorithm for increasing the latency
    rate and fixing the threshold value, the process can be improved. For a better
    understanding, certain additional graphs and charts can be included in the development
    of the Dashboard. SECTION X. Sources of Figures Figure 2 is taken from blog.pimoroni.com

  description: Massive technological advancements in the IoT is contributing a lot
    to make our day-to-day life smarter but this also leads to e-waste production,
    energy use, and toxic emissions. The Green IoT (GIoT) is gradually reducing the
    detrimental effects of IoT. The significance for IoT-based smart and efficient
    agricultural methods is increasing very rapidly for getting a maximum good quality
    harvest by controlling irrigation based on automated environment parameter prediction
    and the enhancement of IoT to GIoT aims at reducing carbon footprints and promotes
    usage of energy-efficient methods. The edge-cloud platform and machine learning
    (ML) algorithms in a smart irrigation and monitoring system provide real-time
    insights into the crops of the farmers. Edge computing process data at the edge
    of network to conserve bandwidth and also helps to reduce the processing load
    over the cloud. A ML process makes an intelligent prediction by correlating the

  description: The United Nations emphasized a significant agenda on reducing hunger
    and protein malnutrition as well as micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) malnutrition,
    which is estimated to affect the health of up to two billion people. The UN also
    recognized this need through Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2 and SDG 12)
    to end hunger and foster sustainable agriculture by enhancing the production and
    consumption of fruits and vegetables. Previous studies only stressed the various
    issues in horticulture with regard to industries, but they did not emphasize the
    centrality of Industry 4.0 technologies for confronting the diverse issues in
    horticulture, from production to marketing in the context of sustainability. The
    current study addresses the significance and application of Industry 4.0 technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain,
    and big data for horticulture in enhancing traditional practices for disease detection,
    irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification, marketing,
    and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest,
    and post-harvest. On the basis of analysis, the article identifies challenges
    and suggests a few vital recommendations for future work. In horticulture settings,
    robotics, drones with vision technology and AI for the detection of pests, weeds,
    plant diseases, and malnutrition, and edge-computing portable devices that can
    be developed with IoT and AI for predicting and estimating crop diseases are vital
    recommendations suggested in the study.

    on reducing hunger and protein malnutrition as well as micronutrient (vitamins
    and minerals) malnutrition, which is estimated to affect the health of up to two
    billion people. The UN also recognized this need through Sustainable Development

    Keywords: horticulture; micronutrient; Industry 4.0; SDGs; IoT; blockchain; real-time
    prediction; AR; bigdata 1. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization and World Health Organization State of Food Security and Nutrition
    in the World (SOFI) report,45 million children die from the deadliest form of
    malnutrition under the age of five [1]. A chronic deficiency of essential nutrients
    in their nutrition has also resulted in delayed development and growth in two
    billion children under the age of five. This indicates that there is a need to
    have more emphasis on overcoming food insecurity and malnutrition due to climate
    extremes and economic disruption. Even the SDGs (SDG 2 and SDG 12) of the UN emphasize
    eradicating hunger and enhancing food security with responsible consumption and
    production toward sustainability [2,3]. Healthy micronutrients for overcoming
    malnutrition can be achieved with sustainable farming of fruits and vegetables,
    i.e., horticulture [4]. India is currently the world’s second-largest producer
    of fruits and vegetables, trailing only China. Horticulture comprises fruits,
    root and tuber crops, mushrooms, vegetables, spices, aromatic plants, flowers,
    bamboo, coconut, cashew, and cocoa. Different strategies such as technology promotion,
    research, post-harvest management, and marketing are key for the growth of horticulture.
    Improving horticulture production, increasing farmer income, improving nutritional
    security, and improving productivity by using quality germplasm, planting material,
    and micro irrigation to save water are the key vision of India for the promotion
    of holistic horticulture growth. Horticulture crops significantly contribute to
    the Indian economy by enhancing farm output, generating employment, and providing
    raw materials to various food-processing businesses [5]. The amount of land allotted
    for horticulture is minimal, but the demand for the production of horticulture
    is high. Therefore, meeting the demand with minimum resources is a bit challenging,
    as sustainable practices need to be adopted to meet a sustainable environment
    [6]. It has also been observed that the export rate of Asian countries such as
    India has increased in the past few years; however, there are a few challenges
    such as meeting quality standards set by international countries and payment for
    exports. The main challenge in fruits and vegetables is the short lifetime after
    plucking. Additionally, given that the majority of horticulture cultivation is
    processed in rural areas, it has been determined that horticulture has to be promoted
    in urban areas. 1.1. Problem Statement Ref. [7] discussed the main problems that
    are present in horticulture, including the decline of fertile soil, global warming,
    rising land prices, shortage of water, and lost opportunity of low-cost labor,
    all of which portray serious threats to growth of horticulture. For horticultural
    crops, abiotic stresses like an inundation, temperature extremes, salinity, pH,
    and drought are major obstacles. As an outcome of global warming, there will be
    less precipitation all in all, and the snow cover will melt faster, resulting
    in extreme drought. These circumstances lead to several stress-related problems,
    including the deficit of fertile soil, flooding, increased evapotranspiration,
    low soil-oxygen levels, decreased production, leachate of nutrients, and slow
    planting. Alongside increasing temperatures, global warming had also contributed
    to record-breaking cold weather. Land salinity and irrigation-water salinity are
    also significant concerns for horticultural production. Along with these problems,
    previous studies also discussed that sustainable pest-management methods need
    to be adopted to protect against pathogens and pest resistance. The absence of
    markets to accumulate production, the substantial percentage of middlemen, the
    absence of marketing institutions safeguarding farmers’ interests, the imperfect
    pricing system, and the absence of transparency in market-information systems,
    especially in the export market, is the main marketing problems for horticultural
    produce. 1.2. Motivation, Novelty, and Contribution of the Study As discussed
    above, the traditional approaches lack appropriate monitoring of pest control,
    water management, soil management, light control, and temperature control, as
    these parameters are crucial for the effective production of horticulture with
    a sustainability aspect. The previous study found that the different issues in
    this group highlight the necessity for more environmentally sound processes, in
    addition to a rise in the utilization of automated systems and accurate processes.
    Industry 4.0 technology has proven its capability in various applications through
    the fusion of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial
    intelligence, blockchain, robotics, digital twins, and big data. The amalgamation
    of Industry 4.0 and horticulture provides the opportunity to transform industrial
    agriculture into the next generation, namely Horticulture 4.0. Moreover, Industry
    4.0 is capable of achieving sustainable and intelligent ecosystem with real-time
    management of farming, automation, intelligent decisions, real-time processing,
    and analysis [8]. It has proved that Industry 4.0 technologies have already delivered
    exceptional results in greenhouse farming for a sustainable food supply chain
    with the integration of hardware and software algorithms and giving rise to higher
    yields using fewer resources and less water. Although many studies have addressed
    Industry 4.0 technologies individually for fruits and vegetables, they are limited
    studies that merely address multiple Industry 4.0 digital technologies as single
    concepts for discussing their significance in horticulture. Based on the aforementioned
    information, this study analyzed the value and applications of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in horticulture for real-time monitoring of fruit-and-vegetable conditions in
    various environmental settings, intelligent and predictive analytics for fruit-and-vegetable
    growth and disease estimation, and virtual horticulture plants. The contribution
    of the study is as follows: The significance of using Industry 4.0 technologies
    for horticulture is discussed in the study for sustainability. We also discuss
    the significance and applications of the Internet of Things, cloud computing,
    artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data for horticulture for enhancing
    traditional practices for disease detection, irrigation management, fertilizer
    management, maturity identification, marketing, and the supply chain, soil fertility,
    and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest Finally, the article
    discusses the challenges and suggests recommendations for the wide adoption of
    any future enhancement in the vicinity of horticulture. In horticulture settings,
    robotics, drones with vision technology and AI for the detection of pests, weeds,
    plant diseases, and malnutrition, and edge-computing portable devices that can
    be developed with IoT and AI for predicting and estimating the disease of crops
    are vital recommendations suggested in the study. 1.3. Methodology of the Study
    In this section, the methodology of the study is presented. Based on the limitations
    identified in previous studies, this study framed a research question that was
    employed to carry out the review. The research question was, “What is the progress
    and significance of Industry 4.0 technology integration in horticulture?” This
    research question constructed various keywords with Boolean function operators
    in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The following strings were considered
    for obtaining publications: “horticulture AND Industry 4.0”, “horticulture AND
    sustainability”, “Industry 4.0 for fruits and vegetables”, “Industry 4.0 AND digitalization”,
    “horticulture AND digitalization”, “horticulture AND IoT”, “IoT AND fruits and
    vegetables”, “disease detection AND horticulture crop”, “blockchain AND horticulture”,
    “artificial intelligence AND horticulture”, “quality assessment AND artificial
    intelligence”, “big data AND horticulture”, “blockchain AND marketing of fruits
    and vegetables”, “blockchain AND energy”, “crop monitoring AND horticulture”,
    and “soil fertility AND horticulture.” During the search for articles, there was
    al ack of articles that merely emphasized the integration of Industry 4.0 for
    horticulture. Therefore, we considered a few conference articles and other supportive
    articles in this study. Based on the obtained articles, the study categorized
    four different sub-sections in which the progress and significance of the previous
    studies that implemented Industry 4.0 for enhancing horticulture from production
    to marketing are assessed. After analyzing the studies, few limitations were identified
    and vital recommendations for future work were suggested. 1.4. Comparative Analysis
    Table 1 provides a comparative analysis of the different studies that focused
    on horticulture that are analyzed within the proposed study. In most previous
    studies, it was identified that the study only focused on some key areas in horticulture,
    like yield monitoring, pesticide monitoring, and quality assessment. A recent
    study emphasized the different issues in horticulture from the perspective of
    industries. Along with this, [9] reviewed the different critical parameters that
    are required for automation with IoT for vertical gardens. Ref. [10] carried out
    a review on the significance of deep-learning models in horticulture for various
    applications. Ref. [11] discussed the implementation of digital twins in horticulture.
    However, there is a possibility of emphasizing the importance of multiple Industry
    4.0 technologies for addressing the different issues of horticulture from production
    to marketing. The current study focused on discussing the different Industry 4.0
    technologies for overcoming the different issues of horticulture within the context
    of sustainability. This study highlights the significance and application of Industry
    4.0 for horticulture. Based on the limitations identified, this study also discusses
    vital recommendations for future work. Table 1. Comparative analysis of the previous
    studies with the current study. The following describes how the study is structured:
    Section 2 discusses an overview of Horticulture 4.0 and Industry 4.0 technologies,
    Section 3 addresses the intervention of Industry 4.0 technologies in horticulture,
    and Section 4 covers the discussion and recommendations. 2. Overview of Horticulture
    and Industry 4.0 High temperatures have two main effects on crop production: they
    inhibit vegetative growth and have a detrimental effect on fruit production. Prolonged
    transpiration along with subjection to extreme temperatures limits vegetable crops
    that are susceptible to considerable transpiration deficits [16,17]. Another problem
    is that the maximum time for the fruit set is proportional to humidity levels.
    Extremely high temperatures can occur. The obvious limitation encountered by cold
    temperatures is the freezing of plant tissues. Rapidly pushing freezing temperatures
    at a phase of rapid growth might cause damage to a variety of plant tissues [18,19].
    Some plants can adapt to cold temperatures provided there is sufficient time and
    the appropriate circumstances, whereas others cannot. Changes in regional precipitation
    patterns may cause an increase in drought conditions in many different parts of
    the world as atmospheric CO2 levels to rise [20]. Although the current belief
    is that leaf photosynthetic responds to high CO2 as well as soil-water deficiency,
    the connections between CO2 enrichment and drought stress remain unexplored [21].
    These are the few problems that have been addressed by previous studies in the
    area of horticulture. Below, we discuss the significance of Industry 4.0 technologies
    and their importance in enhancing practices in horticulture. Industry 4.0, often
    known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is the phenomenon that results from
    the impact of the IoT on information and communication technology. With the help
    of technologies like the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT, and
    the real-time interaction between machinery, software, and people, it aims to
    revolutionize the industry through smart factories that will enable greater flexibility
    in production needs, efficient resource allocation, and process integration from
    device monitoring to final delivery [22]. Figure 1 depicts the technologies that
    can be intervened in horticulture, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain,
    big data, the Internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing, in industry 4.0.
    Figure 1 illustrates the implementation and application area in which Industry
    4.0 can be adopted for horticulture. In horticulture, there are different stages,
    including pre-harvesting, harvest, and post-harvest. Industry 4.0 technologies
    cover the following parameters for horticulture: automation of actuators, disease
    detection, irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification,
    marketing and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns. Along with these
    applications, Industry 4.0 integration in horticulture enables quality assessment
    and grading of horticulture products. The quality assessment of horticulture products
    is different in the three stages. The following are aspects through which the
    quality and grading of a horticulture product are decided, and they are typical
    cultivar ripeness, absence of defects and blemishes, a non-harmful number of pesticide
    residues, freshness, and other chemicals. Therefore, the quality assessment and
    grading of horticulture products mainly rely on the parameters discussed above.
    The monitoring of each parameter and utilizing the data generated from different
    wireless sources with Industry 4.0 technologies boost the performance of the horticulture
    industry for the future. Figure 1. Horticulture 4.0. Overview of Technologies
    and TheirFunctions IoT is the primary technology that enables the provision of
    real-time information that is required for other technologies to implement their
    functions. IoT is an open network of intelligent devices that may self-organize;
    exchange information, data, and resources; and respond and act according to circumstances
    and environmental changes [22]. Fundamentally, IoT comprises the following layers
    in its architecture: perception layer, access layer, network layer, middleware
    layer, and application layer [23]. The perception layer is a key layer in which
    sensors, actuators, and identification technologies empower the transmission of
    real-time information and also enable control of things from remote locations
    through internet connectivity. The network layer empowers the transmission of
    packets of data with the assistance of communication protocols that are embedded
    in the architecture. Wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, and Zigbee are widely
    used communication protocols to establish a wireless sensor network and connect
    it with the internet to form the IoT [24]. The limitations of these communication
    protocols are the short transmission range and high-power consumption. In view
    of the IoT, most IoT devices are resource-constrained (work on battery power),
    so it demands communication protocols that consume less energy and transmit to
    a long range. A low-power–wide-area network (LPWAN) enables these challenges to
    be overcome, as it meets the requirements of the IoT [25]. Long-range (LoRa),
    Sigfox, and narrowband (NB-IoT) are LPWAN communication technologies. As part
    of the application layer, a cloud server is suitable for visualization, real-time
    monitoring, and applying further analytics on the data available in it.AI is the
    science of enabling computers to accomplish intelligent tasks that could only
    be completed by humans. AI is a multidisciplinary technology capable of combining
    machine learning, cognition, human-computer interaction, emotion recognition,
    data storage, and decision-making [26]. The bottleneck of AI was overcome with
    the advancement of processing power, and the development of deep learning and
    enhanced learning based on huge data progressed. With the constant advancement
    of GPUs has come the successful development of customized processors and increased
    computer capacity; this has established the groundwork for AI’s rapid progress.
    Artificial neural networks (ANNs), decision-support systems (DSSs), genetic algorithms
    (Gas), support-vector machines, and computer vision are some of the AI techniques
    that are widely applied in the field of agriculture for the management of soil,
    crops, disease, and weeds [27]. Big data is defined as data sets that are too
    massive or complicated to be acquired, maintained, and processed in a low-latency
    manner by conventional database systems [28]. Big data has characteristics such
    as high volume, high velocity, and high variety. Big-data analytics can ultimately
    enable better and faster decision-making, model, and forecast future outcomes,
    and improve business intelligence [29]. A distributed, unchangeable database called
    blockchain makes it simpler to track assets and record transactions in a corporate
    network [30]. Distributed ledger technology, immutable records, and smart contracts
    are the key elements of blockchain. Each transaction is logged as a “block” of
    data as it occurs. Each block is linked to the ones that come before and after
    it. Transactions are linked in an irreversible chain Horticulture is utilizing
    the IoT to collect data from field planting and horticultural facilities for production,
    management, and service. Robots, drones, remote sensors, and computer imagery
    are used in horticulture as part of the IoT to monitor crops, survey, and map
    fields, as well as to provide data to farmers for logical farm-management strategies
    that will reduce both time and cost [31]. AI is facilitating various sectors in
    agriculture to enhance productiveness and performance and to overcome traditionally
    demanding situations in each field. The intervention of AI in horticulture is
    helping farmers to improve their farming efficiency and reduce hostile environmental
    impacts [32]. Blockchain horticulture empowers information to be traced throughout
    the food supply chain to improve food safety. The ability of blockchain to store
    and manage data creates traceability, which is utilized to enhance the creation
    and deployment of innovations for intelligent farming and index-based horticultural
    insurance. Improved quality control and food safety are advantages of applying
    blockchain to gardening. Increased supply-chain traceability of farmers’ productivity
    will lead to more equitable payments for farmers [33]. Farmers can learn in-depth
    information about topics like rainfall patterns, water cycles, fertilizer requirements,
    and more thanks to large datasets. Companies can utilize this information to choose
    which crops to produce and when to harvest them in order to maximize their profits
    [34]. Data on horticulture are gathered, examined, and stored using cloud computing.
    Farmers can better understand crop conditions by using cloud-connected wireless
    sensors to collect data from the field and machine-learning algorithms to analyze
    that real-time information [35]. Precision horticultural farming heavily relies
    on augmented reality. Farmers can use augmented reality in horticulture to boost
    production, reduce crop waste, and teach other farmers [36]. 3. Intervention of
    Industry 4.0 in Horticulture In this section, we discuss the various Industry
    4.0 technologies in horticulture intending to transform into Horticulture 4.0.
    3.1. IoT Intervention in Horticulture The potential of pests and plant diseases
    is inseparably associated in particular withspecific weather characteristics.
    Previous research concluded that humidity and rainfall have a significant impact
    on pathogen spread and propagation [37]. Pests and diseases are more inclined
    to spread as a result of the wind. According to the information presented above,
    pests and diseases are prevalent in crops, and monitoring of the related parameters
    can be achieved with the IoT. An intelligent monitoring system was proposed on
    the basis of the IoT with a global packet for radio service (GPRS) and Zigbee
    communication protocol for pest warning, planting works, and production-quality
    checks of apples with the assistance of soil sensors, meteorological sensors,
    and cameras [38]. The feasibility, yield, and irrigation water-use efficiency
    of an IoT-based precision-irrigation system with LoRaWAN technology on fresh-market
    tomato production was analyzed [39]. ET, Watermark 200SS-5 soil-metric potential
    sensors, MP40, and a decision-support system were used to design and test four
    irrigation-scheduling treatments. A study was conducted with the integration of
    a camera module, and the images collected were used to analyze the water-management
    system as well as detect plant disease within a green environment [40]. Researchers
    established a technology platform using the IoT for environmental data acquisition,
    disaster warning, transmission, remote control, and an information push in vegetable
    greenhouses in real-time and lessen the influence of climate catastrophes on vegetable
    development [41]. The data collected by an IoT board are expected to be utilized
    to train machine-learning models for the development of intelligent automated
    indoor microclimate horticulture crops [42]. A database contains the results of
    the sensor analysis and it is also linked with data from the Indonesian Weather
    Agency, which contains daily meteorological data from the cultivation location
    [43]. To ensure the proper operation of the greenhouse automation system, multiple
    measuring stations are needed in a modern greenhouse to identify the local climate
    parameters in various areas of a large-scale greenhouse [44]. The IoT paradigm
    is allowing the scientific community to establish integrated settings where data
    could be automatically transferred among many distinctive networks to provide
    consumers with specific relevant information [45]. The security of the foods supplied
    can be ensured by utilizing the provenance data that are kept throughout the supply
    chain of vegetables, including during planting, harvesting, government oversight,
    testing, transportation, customs clearance, warehousing, repackaging, and internal
    testing [46,47]. Every kind of pest and disease is believed to be harmful to plants
    and to have a serious unfavorable effect on horticulture. To decrease the frequent
    use of pesticides and fungicides and to anticipate when pests will arise, the
    IoT system was created [48]. Soft-computing technologies are used to identify
    fruits by combining the three essential characteristics of an object—color, shape,
    and texture. This method reduces the dimensions of the feature vector. As a result,
    the combined and normalized image features produce better classification accuracy
    with fewer training data [49]. Real-time supply-chain monitoring can give stakeholders
    insight into perishable food to better manage to price and take appropriate action
    to uphold quality requirements [50]. Farmers confront a variety of challenges
    when growing vegetables, including issues with seeds, managing pests and diseases,
    commodity costs, and product marketing. Farmers can use the internet and the concept
    of mobile cloud computing to access information and engage in an interactive dialogue
    about vegetable production through mobile learning [51]. A framework for papaya
    grading based on the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm was proposed to classify
    papaya fruits from digital photographs [52,53]. Figure 2 illustrates an architecture
    that was implemented by previous studies for monitoring different parameters in
    horticulture. As discussed in Section 2, one of the key components of the IoT
    is sensors. Sensors such as temperature, soil moisture, humidity, light intensity,
    pH, NPK, and water level are crucial for obtaining important information about
    the soil and environment. Along with these sensors, the camera module is used
    to obtain data from the horticulture field. The sensors remain the same for the
    indoor and outdoor environments of horticulture cultivation. Data on the soil
    and environment are mapped to obtain better productivity by smart controlling
    of irrigation and fertilizer. Based on the soil data, the crop-yield analysis
    is analyzed, and fertilizers can be used as needed. All of these sensors send
    the soil and environment data to the computing unit, at which point the data-sensor
    processor communicates with the cloud server through a wireless-communication
    protocol and gateway. In the cloud server, the data are visualized on the graphical
    user interface. Figure 2. IoT for horticulture. 3.2. AI in Horticulture Fresh
    and wholesome food is essential for feeding the expanding world population, and
    greenhouses and indoor agricultural techniques play a crucial role in this. In
    the past two decades, hyperspectral imaging research has developed, and in the
    decades to come, its use in horticulture is expected to grow. There are still
    challenges to the applicability. The automated detection of pests and diseases
    in plants empowers the effective monitoring of scalable fruit-and-vegetable crops.
    The detection of pests and diseases at the right time enhances pest- and disease-management
    systems [54]. The previous study concluded that AI algorithms can be implemented
    in horticulture for distinct applications, including fruit detection, pest, disease
    detection, weed detection, plant-stress detection, and yield prediction through
    the spectroscopy-and-camera system [55]. A study was implemented to identify common
    pests and diseases in apple fruit using sparse coding. Computer-vision techniques
    can identify pest- and disease-damaged fruits and provide data to assist in the
    detection and treatment of diseases and pests in the early stages [56]. Soil-organic-carbon
    (SOC) monitoring is a crucial characteristic of soil quality because it directly
    determines soil fertility and enables sustainable soil-nutrient management [57].
    To improve SOC prediction, artificial neural networks (ANN), cubist regression,
    support-vector machines (SVM), multiple linear regression (MLR), and random forests
    (RF) were applied to the data of soil-nutrient indicators, total catchment area,
    and the topographic-wetness index. Automatic detection of plant pests and diseases
    can aid in the monitoring of large farms and gardens. The application of AI in
    the drying process of fruits and vegetables has received a lot of attention because
    it can generate better-dried fruit-and-vegetable products when combined with an
    efficient physical field [58,59].An IoT-based tool can determine whether a climacteric
    fruit has been artificially ripened or not. To determine whether the fruit is
    ripened artificially or naturally, machine-learning algorithms are applied [60].
    We discuss these techniques and discuss the significance of combining computer-vision
    techniques with an autonomous robotic system that uses the deep-learning concept
    of artificial intelligence [61]. In order to reduce food waste, one study used
    sensors and analyzed gases produced by certain food products to detect rotten
    food at an early stage and boost accuracy. To forecast how frequently food will
    degrade, the researchers used machine learning, the IoT, and sensors. To assess
    the freshness of food, this study used ML and IoT. The implementation of vision-based
    hardware in robots enables the realization of intelligent spraying, crop-yield
    prediction and price forecasting, predictive insights, and disease diagnosis (Figure
    3). In addition, during the supply chain, the AI-based IoT system enables the
    indoor environment conditions to be adjusted on the basis of external climatic
    conditions and travel time to avoid the spoilage of fruit and vegetables. Figure
    3. AI in horticulture and farming. Table 2 illustrates the different studies that
    implement AI for horticulture crops for disease detection, quality assessment,
    and grading. The table provides the different algorithms that have been implemented
    for feature selection, feature extraction, classification, and regression for
    identifying defects, bruising quality assessment, and grading of the fruit. Different
    studies have used different feature-selection and feature-extraction techniques
    such as random frog, random forest, linear discriminant analysis-based fully convolutional
    networks, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithms,
    uninformative variable elimination, successive projection algorithm, gray histograms,
    and gray-level co-occurrence matrices. Classification and regression techniques
    include least-squares support-vector machines, support vector machines, convolutional
    neural networks, logistic regression, random forest, multilayer perceptron, linear
    discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and backpropagation in the neural
    network. Table 2. AI for horticulture crops. Table 3 illustrates AI implementation
    in horticulture with accuracy and data-acquisition parameters. The previous studies
    illustrate that AI has been implemented for multiple applications such as quality
    assessment of fruit by evaluating moisture levels in the fruits. Following these
    studies, AI was used to forecast the yield of fruits such as bananas and blueberries.
    A few studies implemented AI for the detection and segmentation of apple fruits
    and branches in orchards through fused convolutional features, ResNet-101, clustering-RCNN,
    and CNN. The accuracy of different classifiers is illustrated in the table, and
    SVM, KNN, and DT achieved 100%. During the classification of tomato diseases,
    CNN achieved 99.18% accuracy on the dataset formed from 14,828 images. In the
    detection of citrus fruits, the CNN applied to the UAV images achieved 96.24%
    accuracy. Table 3. AI implementation for horticulture with accuracy and data-acquisition
    sources. 3.3. Blockchain Blockchain is a distributed-ledger technology with the
    advantage of being tamper-resistant to information. It is anticipated to be able
    to address the issue of resource allocation for transactions among numerous unreliable
    parties in the supply chain for fresh fruit [76]. One potential method for supply-chain
    traceability in the pineapple industry is blockchain technology. The fruit-chain
    protocol that was introduced has identical consistency and liveliness qualities
    as assuming an honest majority of computer power [77] and is roughly fair with
    an overwhelming probability. Although blockchain might be viewed as a viable option
    for food-chain traceability, it was determined that [78] the goal of the investigation
    was to learn more about blockchain technology and its potential applications in
    the retail industry. Additionally, potential blockchain uses that might help the
    retail sector and the wider industry are foreseen. The study also underlined the
    crucial role that blockchain technology plays in the retail sector for fruit as
    well as the connections between these aspects [79]. Figure 4 shows blockchain
    technology in horticulture. The blockchain enables a distributed network to be
    established among the different entities in the supply chain for real-time monitoring
    and tracking of the activities from any location that is immutable and transparent.
    Blockchain empowers digital and secure trading to be created by incorporating
    smart contracts between entities. In addition, blockchain enables the realization
    of secured transactions of the export of fruits and vegetables in the international
    market. The quality and standards of the fruits and vegetables that are set by
    international bodies can be protected with secured hash cryptography. Figure 4.
    Blockchain technology in horticulture. Consumers are driving an entirely different
    transformation in food procurement as a consequence of the growth in global food
    catastrophes that are triggering health insecurity. Consumers have called for
    transparency, traceability, and attentiveness along the entire fruit supply chain.
    The importance of the supply chain in this industry is increased by the fact that
    the products are perishable and have a limited shelf life. Yields are impacted
    by inconsistent delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as a result
    of dependence on middlemen, market instability, and other factors. Increased costs
    for input and transportation, post-harvest losses, and problems with safety and
    quality dominating supply-chain losses are key challenges involved in the fruit
    supply chain. Blockchain integration in the fruit supply chain (Figure 5) allows
    for post-harvest and inventory management streamlining, increasing operational
    effectiveness and lowering losses. End-to-end traceability with QR codes on the
    fruits presents the final customer with an honest and reliable narrative. A fair
    price for the producers is ensured by the grouping and collaboration of all stakeholders
    on a single platform, which fosters confidence and transparency. Real-time data
    collection allows for simple tracking and tracing, which helps with recall management.
    In addition to this, blockchain is used for monitoring the pre-harvest process
    for yield and quality. Post-harvest management for monitoring the crucial phases
    to prevent losses and boost output, monitoring a set of procedures for confirming
    sustainable practices, and digital records that cannot be altered and display
    accurate information are necessary to meet legal requirements. Figure 5. Applications
    of blockchain for Horticulture 4.0. 3.4. Big Data in Horticulture A multi-sensor
    network system was established to accumulate smaller ecological statistical data
    on vegetable-growing regions. Researchers were able to identify the critical components
    pushing pest spread using multidimensional information such as environment, soil,
    meteorology of vegetable fields, and ultimately the vegetable-pest warning system
    premised on multidimensional big data [80]. The distinctive nutrition-based vegetable-production
    and -distribution system utilizes the inventive big-data framework and its multiple
    benefits to provide a healthful food recommendation to the end customer as well
    as various predictive analyses to boost system efficacy [45]. The new ICT horticulture
    project will heavily rely on big-data methodologies; therefore, it is important
    to understand how to manage them and how they could affect everyday business [81]
    Big-data intervention in horticulture is presented in Figure 6. Because fruits
    and vegetables are produced in such large quantities, the sensor data that are
    available and can be used in horticulture are now considered big data. The big
    data can be transmitted to the cloud server and made available in a distribution
    box and control box through wireless-communication protocols. Figure 6. Big-data
    overview in horticulture. 4. Results In this section, the results identified from
    the analysis of previous studies based on Industry 4.0 integration for horticulture
    monitoring are discussed. The IoT is predominantly used in horticulture to monitor
    various pests and diseases that are harmful to plants and have a serious negative
    impact on horticulture. The Internet of Things system was configured to minimize
    the frequency with which pesticides and fungicides are used and to predict when
    pests will appear. Along with this, IoT and cloud computing are employed to identify
    fruits by combining an object’s three essential characteristics—color, shape,
    and texture. Farmers face a variety of challenges when growing vegetables, including
    seed issues, pest-and-disease management, commodity costs, and product marketing.
    Farmers can access information and engage in an interactive process about vegetable
    production through the internet and the concept of the mobile cloud. AI in horticulture
    enables the detection of diseases, quality assessment, and grading of horticulture
    crops. Linear discriminant analysis-based fully convolutional networks, random
    forest, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithm,
    uninformative variable elimination, successive projection algorithm, and gray-level
    co-occurrence matrix have been used for feature extraction and selection. Least-squares
    support-vector machine, support-vector machine, convolutional neural networks,
    logistic regression, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors
    are the key techniques used for classification and regression. Yields are impacted
    by inconsistent delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as a result
    of dependence on middlemen, market instability, and other factors. Increased input
    and transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and safety and quality issues dominate
    supply-chain losses. However, the incorporation of blockchain improves pre-harvest
    and post-harvest management through real-time tracing and secure transactions
    in the distributed network. 5. Discussion and Recommendation In this section,
    based on the discussion of the analysis above, we discuss the recommendations
    for applications in horticulture as part of future work. A few vital recommendations
    are as follows: When considering long-term benefits like improved production and
    automation, the use of the IoT in horticulture is strongly advised and very successful.
    The Internet of Drones enables horticulture operations to be improved. The Internet
    of Drones is an architecture intended to focus on providing UAVs, also commonly
    known as drones, with coordinated connectivity to controlled airspace. Drones
    for horticulture are used to monitor fields, plant crops, irrigate fields, spray
    pesticides, and also to assess the health of plants [82,83]. Moreover, drones
    with vision-based technology and AI empower the detection of weeds and identify
    the stages of the growth of plants in pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest.
    Drones can be used to monitor the quality assessment and grading of horticulture
    crops to minimize the damage and loss of the product during transportation and
    storage. Robotics leverage AI technology to improve harvest quality and precision.
    In horticulture settings, robotics with vision technology and AI for the detection
    of pests, plant diseases, and malnutrition. Before choosing which herbicide to
    apply in a region, AI can detect and target weeds through the visuals obtained
    from the camera module inserted into robots. A wide range of issues in the farming
    sector can be resolved by using an amalgamation of robots and AI approaches [84].
    In addition to this, currently, different robots with AI technology are used for
    weed removal and plucking, sorting, and packaging of fruits [85]. Globally, horticulture
    supply chains have an exciting opportunity to improve transactional efficiency,
    reduce resistance, and promote traceability thanks to blockchain technology [80].
    Blockchain technology can help the horticulture and food industry deal with and
    control known risks while maintaining affordability across the ecosystem. Blockchain
    in horticulture enables the linking of various horticultural entities for the
    visualization of data from production to supply on distributed-ledger networks.
    Granular information on rainfall patterns, water cycles, fertilizer requirements,
    and more are made available to farmers through big data. This enables them to
    make wise decisions, such as which plants to sow for greater profitability and
    when to harvest. Making the proper choices ultimately increase crop output. The
    fundamental goal of precision horticulture is to guarantee profitability, efficacy,
    and sustainability [86]. In horticulture, edge computing is employed for different
    activities. Edge computing can be utilized to analyze the data at the edge of
    a network for better monitoring and productivity. Mobile edge computing (MEC)
    is an architecture that provides cloud-computing services at the edge of networks
    leveraging mobile base stations [87,88]. Currently, different study areas have
    implemented edge-computing-based portable devices in order to predict what is
    useful for the user in enhancing their practices [89,90]. In the scenario of horticulture,
    an edge-computing-based portable device can be developed with IoT and AI for predicting
    and estimating disease in a crop. Based on the analysis and prediction, it can
    also communicate to the user on the cloud server and the respective horticulture
    authorities to suggest a solution in real-time. Figure 7 illustrates a hybrid
    architecture that is implemented in horticulture with the amalgamation of the
    IoT, cloud computing, AI/ML, blockchain, and big data. This architecture enables
    a smart and intelligent ecosystem to be achieved in horticulture with multiple
    features such as blockchain-assisted marketing, prediction of international markets,
    and the quality of fruits and vegetables based on real-time environmental data.
    The generated output and sensor data can then be distributed in the peer-to-peer
    network of any location. Figure 7. Hybrid architecture for Horticulture 4.0. 6.
    Conclusions Horticulture is the field of cultivation of fruits and vegetables.
    It ensures production and consumption by minimizing malnutrition in the current
    scenario addressed by United Nations. Recently, Industry 4.0 technologies have
    delivered the ability of digitalization and realize the SDGs set by the United
    Nations. The previous studies did not highlight the significance and application
    of Industry 4.0 for distinct issues of horticulture. Based on this limitation,
    the current study addressed the significance and application of Industry 4.0 technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain,
    and big data for horticulture to enhance traditional practices of disease detection,
    irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification, marketing,
    and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest,
    and post-harvest. The findings of the study are as follows: in horticulture, the
    IoT is primarily used to monitor various pests and diseases that are harmful to
    plants and have a serious negative impact on horticulture. In addition, IoT and
    cloud computing is used to identify fruits by combining three essential characteristics
    of an object: color, shape, and texture.AI in horticulture has enabled the detection
    of diseases, quality assessment, and crop grading. For feature extraction and
    selection, we used fully convolutional networks, a random forest, and a competitive
    adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithm based on linear discriminant
    analysis. The key techniques used for classification and regression are the least-squares
    support-vector machine, support-vector machine, convolutional neural networks,
    logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors. Inconsistent
    delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as an outcome of dependence
    on middlemen, market instability, and other factors have a negative impact on
    yields. Increased input and transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and safety
    and quality issues that dominate supply-chain losses can be overcome with blockchain
    during-harvest and post-harvest management. Finally, the study suggested vital
    recommendations for future works, such as robotics; drones with vision technology
    and AI for the detection of pests, weeds, plant diseases, and malnutrition; and
    edge computing portable devices developed with the IoT and AI for predicting and
    estimating disease in crops. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.S. (Rajesh

  description: 'In this contribution, we sketch an application of Earth System Sciences
    and Cloud-/Big-Data-based IT, which shall soon leverage European supercomputing
    facilities: smart viticulture, as put into practice by Terraview. TerraviewOS
    is a smart vineyard “operating system”, allowing wine cultivators to optimise
    irrigation, harvesting dates and measures against plant diseases. The system relies
    on satellite and drone imagery as well as in-situ sensors where available. Clearly,
    processing behind the UI is heavily based on Cloud Computing, with some Edge Computing
    close to the user or High-Performance/GPU Computing components. The substantial
    need for computing power in TerraviewOS, in particular for training AI-based models
    to generate derived data products, makes the further development of some of its
    modules a prime use case for the EU-funded Extreme Data processing project “EXA4MIND”
    (Horizon Europe GA No. 101092944). Two of the strongest academic supercomputing
    centres in Europe take part in EXA4MIND. The collaboration to evolve the “Smart
    Moisture Mapper” subsystem of TerraviewOS in this context is briefly sketched.
    Connecting database systems, High-Performance-/Cloud-Computing systems and European
    Data Spaces with appropriate data access and transfer mechanisms, EXA4MIND shall
    demonstrate competitive advantage in scientific and enterprise data analysis needed
    in complex applications such as TerraviewOS.'

  explanation: '**Paper Overview**


    **Title:** Unleashing the Power of Edge Computing for Real-Time Irrigation Management:
    A Comprehensive Review


    **Authors:** [Insert Author(s) Name(s)]


    **Abstract:** This paper provides a comprehensive review of edge computing in
    the context of real-time irrigation management. It explores the benefits of edge
    computing, such as reduced latency and improved responsiveness, and discusses
    the challenges associated with its implementation. The paper also presents a taxonomy
    of edge computing applications in irrigation management and identifies promising
    research directions.'
  extract_1: Edge computing offers several advantages for real-time irrigation management,
    including reduced latency, improved responsiveness, and increased data privacy.
    By processing data closer to the source, edge computing can reduce the time it
    takes to make decisions and take action, which can lead to improved crop yields
    and water savings.
  extract_2: Edge computing can also help to overcome the challenges of implementing
    real-time irrigation management systems in remote areas. By processing data locally,
    edge devices can reduce the need for expensive and unreliable communication networks.

    PDF 1 Introduction Food security is a crucial global problem affecting billions
    of people worldwide. Food security is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation
    of the United Nations (FAO) as “when all people, at all times, have physical,
    social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their
    dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (Cudjoe et
    al. 2021). Despite tremendous improvements in recent decades, food security remains
    a key concern, especially in developing nations and among vulnerable people (Keesstra
    et al. 2016). The world’s population continues to rise, placing enormous strain
    on agricultural systems to produce enough food to feed everyone effectively. Weather
    patterns that are erratic, severe occurrences, and changing climatic circumstances
    significantly influence agricultural production, resulting in crop failures, lower
    yields, and food shortages (Nathan and Joel Uche 2023; Oseni and Masarirambi 2011).
    Soil erosion, deforestation, and degradation of arable land endanger agricultural
    production and restrict cultivable land availability. Water shortage in many locations
    impedes irrigation and farming practices, resulting in water stress and lower
    crop yields. Much of the world’s food supply is lost or squandered at different
    points throughout the supply chain, from production to consumption, aggravating
    food poverty (Khanna, 2018). Sustainable agriculture is an important strategy
    for addressing global food security concerns while minimizing negative environmental
    consequences. Sustainable agriculture seeks to increase production, protect natural
    resources, promote ecological balance, and assure farmers’ economic viability
    (Herzberg et al. 2022). It entails putting practices that promote long-term food
    production in place while neither depleting resources nor damaging the environment
    (Abubakar 2021). The AIoT has emerged as a disruptive technology with enormous
    promise to revolutionise the agriculture industry in recent years. The AIoT is
    a network of networked devices with sensors, software, and data analytics capabilities
    that gather and share data via the Internet. AIoT may be used in agriculture to
    monitor and manage different elements of farming, such as crop health, irrigation,
    pest control, and animal management (Saad et al. 2023). Furthermore, recision
    farming is made possible by AIoT-enabled sensors and data analytics, which allow
    farmers to monitor and optimise inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides,
    resulting in higher efficiency and decreased resource waste (Giuffrida et al.
    2022). Weather forecasting and monitoring powered by AIoT assist farmers in adapting
    to changing weather patterns, mitigating risks, and making educated crop management
    choices. AIoT enables farmers to monitor their crops and animals from afar remotely,
    increasing output and minimising the requirement for personal presence (Kemmoe
    et al. 2022). AIoT applications in the food supply chain increase traceability,
    minimize food loss, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. AIoT technologies
    improve efficiency and solve problems in agriculture and food supply systems.
    Food security and sustainable agriculture need precision farming, smart irrigation,
    livestock monitoring, supply chain traceability, climate resilience, data-driven
    decision-making, and sustainable resource management (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022).
    The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015
    to address worldwide social, economic, and environmental challenges. These 17
    global objectives provide a comprehensive framework for promoting sustainable
    development and improving people’s well-being. They cover various issues such
    as poverty eradication, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water,
    sanitation, affordable energy, decent work, industry, innovation, climate action,
    life below water, life on land, peace and justice, and strong institutions (Kalu
    et al. 2021). The SDGs emphasize collaboration among governments, businesses,
    civil society, and individuals to achieve sustainable development. By 2030, the
    SDGs aim to end poverty, hunger, inequality, access to quality education and healthcare,
    promote sustainable economic growth, combat climate change, and protect biodiversity
    (Erin and Bamigboye 2022). Implementing the SDGs requires political commitment,
    adequate resources, and effective policies. Governments play a crucial role in
    setting national priorities, aligning policies with the SDGs, and mobilizing financial
    resources. Businesses are encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, invest in
    innovation, and contribute to the achievement of the goals (Khan et al. 2022).
    In conclusion, the SDGs represent a global roadmap for creating a more sustainable
    and equitable future for all, addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality,
    and environmental degradation. Achieving the SDGs requires collective efforts
    and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. The study’s research goal is
    to look at the role of AIoT in promoting sustainable agriculture and tackling
    food security issues. The research will examine the possible advantages and drawbacks
    of AIoT applications in agriculture, such as crop management, water conservation,
    animal monitoring, and supply chain management. The study will thoroughly examine
    current literature, case studies, and real-world deployments of AIoT solutions
    in agriculture. It will concentrate on the influence of AIoT on agricultural production,
    resource efficiency, and climate change resistance. In addition, the research
    will look at the problems and hurdles to AIoT adoption in agriculture, policy
    implications, and future trends. Overall, this study aims to improve knowledge
    of how AIoT may play an important role in promoting sustainable agriculture and
    maintaining food security in a fast-changing world. The study seeks to give significant
    insights for policymakers, academics, and stakeholders to make informed choices
    and build strategies for sustainable agricultural growth by highlighting the prospects
    and difficulties of AIoT adoption in agriculture. This chapter is arranged into
    nine different sections. In Sect. 2, the related works are discussed in detail.
    The research on AIoT applications in sustainable agriculture is presented in detail
    in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides a discussion on AIoT in food supply chain management.
    Section 5 provides the challenges and barriers. Section 6 discusses the policy
    and regulatory considerations. Section 7 provides the Case Studies and real-world
    implementations as well as future trends and innovations are provided in Sect.
    8. Finally, Sect. 9 concludes the study. 2 Literature Review Climate change, water
    shortages, and the need for effective resource management are just a few of the
    many obstacles that agriculture must overcome to ensure the world''s food supply.
    The AIoT has emerged as a potent tool to overcome these obstacles and improve
    agriculture’s long-term viability (Praveen et al. 2021). AIoT systems use sensors,
    data analytics, and real-time connectivity to monitor and optimize agricultural
    operations for higher yields, lower resource waste, and safer food supplies (Nwankwoala
    and Okujagu 2021). This section examines current AIoT technologies for sustainable
    agriculture and food security. Using sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature,
    nutrient levels, and crop health is at the heart of precision farming, a prominent
    use in agriculture. More informed choices about watering, fertilizing, and controlling
    pests may be made by farmers thanks to this information (Sohel et al. 2022). With
    real-time data from weather stations and soil moisture sensors, AIoT-enabled smart
    irrigation systems can fine-tune watering schedules to meet the precise needs
    of individual crops. These methods help farmers save water and irrigate their
    crops more efficiently, especially in arid areas (Farooq et al. 2022). AIoT devices
    with sensors and GPS may track cattle and monitor their well-being and habits.
    Better livestock management and greater food production result from using livestock
    monitoring tools that assist farmers in identifying health problems early, optimizing
    feeding patterns and enhancing breeding practices (Eze et al. 2022). Due to AIoT-based
    supply chain traceability systems, food goods may be tracked and monitored in
    real-time through the supply chain. These methods improve visibility and tracking,
    safeguarding against food fraud and keeping consumers secure (Farooq et al. 2022;
    Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Weather patterns, temperature, and humidity data are
    gathered via AIoT-based weather stations and environmental sensors, which are
    then used for climate monitoring and prediction (Al-otaibi 2022). This information
    is utilized to foresee the effects of climate change and harsh weather on crops,
    allowing farmers to make necessary preparations in advance. To keep tabs on pest
    populations in farms, AIoT systems have integrated pest monitoring sensors and
    data analytics. As stated by (Zhao et al. 2022), pests may be managed more sustainably
    and with less reliance on chemical pesticides if their presence is identified
    sufficiently soon. Automated and optimized nutrition and water management is achieved
    via integrating AIoT technology into aquaponics and hydroponics systems. These
    methods allow for year-round farming, reduce water use, and boost the long-term
    viability of fish and vegetable harvests (Yoon 2020). Data on crop health and
    stress may be gathered in real-time via remote sensing technologies like satellites
    and drones fitted with AIoT sensors. This data aids farmers in making early diagnoses
    of disease and nutritional deficits, which leads to more focused treatments and
    fewer crop failures (Abdullahi et al. 2022). AIoT technologies use automated traps,
    drones, and AI for smart pest control (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). This allows for
    precise monitoring and managing of pest populations without harming the ecosystem.
    Indicators of soil health, such as pH, nutrient content, and organic matter, are
    tracked using AIoT sensors and devices. Producing crops sustainably and effectively
    requires this information to implement precision agricultural practices and enhance
    soil fertility (Mishra and Pandya 2021). As a result of optimizing resource utilization,
    increasing productivity, and raising the efficiency of food supply chains, AIoT
    technologies have the potential to revolutionize agriculture and solve food security
    concerns. Current AIoT solutions show how important technology is to attaining
    sustainable agriculture and meeting the needs of a rising global population. 3
    AIoT Applications in Sustainable Agriculture Global food security depends on agriculture,
    yet climate change, water shortages, and resource management pose concerns. The
    AIoT can solve these problems and improve agriculture’s sustainability. AIoT systems
    monitor and optimize agricultural processes using sensors, data analytics, and
    real-time connectivity, improving productivity, resource efficiency, and food
    security (Dibia and Nwaigwe 2017; Herzberg et al. 2022). For precision farming,
    AIoT sensors capture soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and crop health
    data. This data may help farmers optimize irrigation, fertilization, and insect
    management for better resource utilization and crop yields. Smart irrigation systems
    optimize watering schedules based on crop water needs using real-time data from
    weather stations and soil moisture sensors (Ambayea et al. 2022). Livestock monitoring
    systems enhance livestock management and food production by detecting health concerns
    early, optimizing feeding patterns, and improving breeding practices. Supply chain
    traceability systems reduce food fraud and ensure food safety by tracking and
    monitoring food goods in real-time (Oberlack et al. 2021). Farmers can modify
    their practices and safeguard their from bad weather using AIoT-based weather
    stations and environmental sensors. Data analytics and integrated pest monitoring
    devices reduce the demand for chemical pesticides and promote eco-friendly pest
    control (Awofeso and Odeyemi 2021). Aquaponics and hydroponics systems automate
    and optimise nutrition and water management, allowing year-round growing, decreased
    water use, and sustainable fish and vegetable production. Farmers need remote
    sensing for crop health and stress to identify illnesses and nutrient shortages
    early and cure them for maximum development and output (Norton 2016). Farmers
    may plan planting, irrigation, and pest management using weather forecasts and
    predictive analytics. Smart farming and precision agriculture improve crop quality,
    food safety, efficiency, sustainability, data-driven decision-making, labour,
    and time (Ambayea et al. 2022; Voora et al. 2022). However, early investment expenditures,
    data privacy and security issues, and farmers’ technical knowledge are obstacles.
    Smart farming may be vital to global food security and environmental sustainability
    as technology advances. Thus, components of precision agriculture are illustrated
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 The components of precision agriculture (Herzberg et al. 2022)
    Full size image 3.1 Smart Irrigation and Water Management Smart irrigation is
    a cutting-edge technique for managing water in agriculture. It allows farmers
    to save water without sacrificing yield. Smart irrigation systems reduce water
    waste while supplying water reliably to crops depending on individual demands,
    local weather, and other data collected from various sensors and AIoT devices
    (Raghuvanshi et al. 2022). Agriculture uses a lot of water, so finding ways to
    save and reuse that water is essential. Smart irrigation systems determine when
    and how much water should be supplied to crops by monitoring soil moisture and
    evapotranspiration rates (Zhang, Xu et al. 2022b). Smart agricultural practices,
    such as drip irrigation and controlled watering systems, are increasingly used
    to reduce water waste from evaporation and runoff. This technology allows farmers
    to minimize labor by remotely controlling irrigation cycles and maintaining a
    steady water supply. Smart irrigation helps conserve water, grow crops with the
    same amount of water, save money, be more eco-friendly, and be less vulnerable
    to climate change (Neupane et al. 2022; Ning and Liu 2015). However, barriers
    to wider adoption exist, including the need for costly upfront investments, specialized
    knowledge, and consistent access to the Internet (Arubayi 2023). Finally, smart
    irrigation and water management provide a game-changing strategy for environmentally
    responsible farming by helping farmers reduce water waste, maximize crop output,
    and safeguard natural resources. Farmers can help ensure food security in the
    face of climate change by adopting smart irrigation practices like drip irrigation
    and automated watering systems (Merem et al. 2018). Smart irrigation in agriculture
    is predicted to play a crucial role in attaining sustainable water management
    and guaranteeing the resilience of agricultural systems as technology develops.
    3.2 Livestock Management and Health Monitoring Livestock management is an important
    part of contemporary agriculture since it ensures the health and production of
    livestock animals (Ali and Choi 2020). AIoT technology is helping to improve livestock
    management and health monitoring. Farmers may monitor their animals’ health, behaviour,
    and position in real-time by employing wearable sensors and tracking devices,
    allowing for early diagnosis of health concerns or irregularities (Okonofua et
    al. 2021). AIoT-enabled monitoring devices give significant data into cattle movement
    and behaviour, assisting farmers in managing grazing patterns and preventing straying.
    Behavioral monitoring may detect indicators of discomfort or changes in eating
    patterns, resulting in better animal welfare (Kochovski and Stankovski 2018).
    One of the most important advantages of AIoT in livestock management is illness
    diagnosis and prevention facilitated by AIoT. AIoT devices may notify farmers
    of any sickness or stress symptoms by monitoring vital signs and physiological
    factors, limiting disease transmission and significant economic losses (Khan and
    Ahmad 2022). Furthermore, AIoT-based data analytics may aid in identifying illness
    patterns and trends, hence contributing to the creation of effective disease preventive
    programmes. AIoT technology increases animal welfare, productivity, labour costs,
    resource management efficiency, illness control, and biosecurity. However, there
    are hurdles to using AIoT in livestock management, such as initial expenses for
    AIoT devices and infrastructure, dependable connection in remote locations, and
    data privacy and security issues (Abdullahi et al. 2022). Finally, AIoT technology
    has revolutionized livestock management and health monitoring in agriculture,
    allowing farmers to carefully monitor the health and behavior of their animals,
    resulting in enhanced animal welfare and production. AIoT-enabled early disease
    detection and prevention improve biosecurity measures and minimize illness-related
    economic losses (Mishra and Pandya 2021; Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). To ensure the
    well-being of animals and farmers, the AIoT integration in livestock management
    will be crucial as technology develops, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Livestock
    management and health monitoring (Darem et al. 2022) Full size image 4 AIoT in
    Food Supply Chain Management The AIoT has changed the logistics and supply chain
    management industries by enabling real-time monitoring and tracing of items in
    transit. Sensors and gadgets enabled by the are built into things, containers,
    and vehicles to track and record data such as location, temperature, and humidity
    (Praveen et al. 2021). This real-time information allows businesses to streamline
    their supply chains and reduce wasted time and money. Due to AIoT-enabled smart
    logistics, companies can improve inventory management, save operating costs, and
    boost customer satisfaction with on-time, precise delivery (Kamble et al. 2019).
    Perishable items’ quality and safety, including fresh fruit, medicines, and vaccinations,
    depend on effective cold chain management and food preservation (Zhong et al.
    2015). Cold chain management powered by the helps keep goods fresh and secure
    across the supply chain, which helps cut down on food waste and boosts food security.
    Assuring the quality and security of goods via sensors and monitoring is crucial.
    Sensors enabled by the can check food for pH, moisture, and pollutants to ensure
    it''s safe and up to standards (Nozari et al. 2022; Rehman Khan et al. 2022).
    The AIoT makes supply chain visibility, transparency, efficiency, cost savings,
    product quality and safety improvements, sustainability, and environmental impact
    possible (Ezenwa 2019). Data privacy and security, standardization and interoperability
    of AIoT systems, and dependable and continuous connection are just a few hurdles
    that need to be cleared before widespread adoption can occur in supply chain and
    food management (Bertin et al. 2022). AIoT-enabled smart logistics and supply
    chain monitoring, cold chain management, and quality and safety assurance are
    revolutionizing how organizations operate and ensuring that supply chain operations
    are efficient and sustainable (Zakeri et al. 2022). Companies can improve logistics,
    protect the freshness of perishable items, and guarantee their products’ safety
    by using real-time data and insights (Zhong et al. 2015). To keep up with the
    demands of the current business environment and ensure the delivery of high-quality
    goods to customers, supply chain management must increasingly use AIoT technologies,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 AIoT in food supply chain management (Zhong et
    al. 2015) Full size image 5 Challenges and Barriers The technological difficulty
    of establishing and maintaining AIoT systems is a major obstacle to their widespread
    use in agriculture. Integrating sensors, devices, and networking technologies
    may be difficult, particularly for small-scale farmers in rural places with little
    infrastructure (Lu 2018). AIoT applications demand real-time data transfer, which
    might be difficult in rural areas. Data security and privacy are crucial as AIoT
    devices create massive volumes of data. Farmers must secure their crop production,
    soil health, and market data against unauthorized access and cyberattacks (Abdullahi
    et al. 2022). Data encryption, access limits, and secure communication protocols
    protect farmers’ vital data. Small-scale farmers and underdeveloped areas may
    struggle to use AIoT technology due to their high upfront costs. AIoT devices,
    sensors, and connection solutions are costly, making it hard for resource-constrained
    farmers to use them (Zimba 2022). Technical support and maintenance may also strain
    finances. Lack of awareness and understanding of AIoT, limited access to technical
    competence, and cultural opposition to new technology may hinder small-scale farmers
    in developing nations. These areas may additionally struggle to embrace AIoT technologies
    due to language and digital literacy issues (Al Qartah 2020). 5.1 Solution and
    Mitigation Technical constraints, data security concerns, financial issues, and
    acceptance hurdles might prevent the broad adoption of AIoT in agriculture, especially
    in small farms and developing nations. Stakeholders, including governments, commercial
    enterprises, and non-profits, must work together to solve these problems (Hammi
    et al. 2022). By promoting accessible and user-friendly AIoT solutions, guaranteeing
    data security, giving financial incentives, and helping farmers with capacity
    development and training, the agricultural industry can maximize AIoT’s potential
    for sustainable and efficient farming (Ouechtati et al. 2021). Simplified and
    User-Friendly Solutions: Small-scale farmers may use AIoT solutions that are user-friendly
    and cost-effective. Plug-and-play AIoT devices and straightforward interfaces
    may help farmers set up and employ AIoT technology (Jayashankar et al. 2018).
    Public–Private Partnerships: Government agencies, private firms, and NGOs may
    work together to deliver AIoT solutions in poor countries. Joint projects may
    overcome financial and technical constraints and give farmers with training and
    assistance (Hammi et al. 2022). Data Security: Encryption and authentication help
    secure farmers’ data from cyberattacks. To protect data privacy, farmers must
    be educated about data security (Bertin et al. 2022). Subsidies and Incentives:
    Government subsidies or financial incentives for adopting AIoT technology might
    encourage small-scale farmers to invest in these solutions. Implementation costs
    may be reduced via cost-sharing and tax incentives. Training and capacity development
    may improve farmers’ digital literacy and technical abilities. Extension programmes
    and training may assist farmers in grasping AIoT devices (Hammi et al. 2022).
    6 Policy and Regulatory Considerations Agriculture might become more sustainable,
    efficient, and productive using AIoT technology. Through different programmes,
    governments worldwide have supported AIoT adoption. These include financial support,
    research and development funding, capacity building and training, regulatory frameworks,
    public–private partnerships, testbeds and demonstration farms, digital infrastructure
    development, data analytics, and decision support, market linkages and e-commerce
    platforms, and policy advocacy (Lu 2018). These projects have helped farmers use
    AIoT to solve agricultural problems, boost production, and adopt sustainable and
    efficient farming methods. International partnerships and standards are critical
    to developing and accepting AIoT-based food security solutions since governments,
    organisations, and stakeholders must work together to solve the agricultural and
    food sectors’ complex problems (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). The widespread use of
    AIoT technology in agriculture has led to sustainable, efficient, and more productive
    farming. Governments worldwide have been actively pushing and supporting the adoption
    of AIoT due to its critical importance (Fang et al. 2012). Governments provide
    financial assistance, grants, and subsidies to encourage farmers and agricultural
    enterprises to invest in AIoT technology. These rebates reduce the out-of-pocket
    expense of implementing an AIoT system or device, making them more feasible for
    farms of all sizes. Government funding for research and development (R&D) programs
    that provide specialized AIoT solutions for agriculture, such as precision agriculture,
    remote sensing, and livestock monitoring, has led to the developing cutting-edge
    tools and methods (Zhang, Li et al. 2022a). Governments host training programs
    and seminars to improve farmers’ and agricultural employees’ familiarity with
    digital literacy and technical abilities. They set up legislative frameworks that
    make it easier for farmers to use AIoT. Governments create standards for AIoT
    devices and data privacy rules to guarantee the safety of AIoT solutions and protect
    farmers’ data. They work with businesses, universities, and NGOs to promote the
    use of AIoT in farming via public–private partnerships, resulting in increased
    opportunities for information exchange, access to cutting-edge technology, and
    the creation of industry-specific AIoT solutions (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Governments
    also invest in constructing and updating digital infrastructure, such as high-speed
    internet access and mobile networks, to guarantee uninterrupted data transfer
    and communication between farm AIoT devices. They provide data analytics and decision
    support systems that use information gathered from AIoT devices to advise farmers
    on improving their operations (Yin et al. 2022). Governments also develop e-commerce
    platforms that link farmers with customers or purchasers, improving market connections
    and maintaining produce quality and traceability throughout the supply chain.
    Governments advocate for policies that encourage the use of AIoT in farming, such
    as lowering taxes, fostering cross-institutional research partnerships, and lobbying
    for more lenient rules (Godager et al. 2021). The extensive use of AIoT technology
    in agriculture can be attributed to various factors, including financial incentives,
    R&D funding, capacity building, regulatory frameworks, public–private partnerships,
    and the growth of digital infrastructure (Yang et al. 2021). Sharing knowledge
    and best practices helps advance AIoT-based food security solutions. International
    cooperation and standards are essential for food security. Sharing knowledge,
    harmonizing standards, aggregating data, fostering research and development, aligning
    policies, pooling resources, and building capacities can help countries and organisations
    develop cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions for the global agriculture
    and food sectors (Kumar et al. 2020). These agreements allow data exchange and
    aggregation, improving AIoT-based food security solutions. Cross-border research
    and development projects bring together professionals from various nations to
    solve food security issues, resulting in cutting-edge technology and novel solutions
    (Yin et al. 2022). Funding and resource allocation, capacity development and training,
    scaling up successful projects, and addressing data privacy and security issues
    are all examples of ways in which policy alignment and collaboration may be fostered.
    Thus, AIoT-based food security solutions can only be fully realised via international
    cooperation and standardization. Sharing information, harmonizing standards, gathering
    data, promoting research and development, aligning policies, pooling resources,
    and creating skills may help governments and organizations handle global food
    security issues. These combined efforts will lead to sustainable and resilient
    food systems for everybody (Chilaka and Chilaka 2019). 7 Case Studies and Real-World
    Implementations The ability of AIoT solutions to tackle difficult problems and
    propel good change has been shown by their widespread adoption in some countries.
    AIoT technology may enhance productivity, sustainability, and resource management,
    as shown by the featured case studies in precision agriculture, fisheries management,
    and smart grids. Guidelines for future AIoT implementations may be derived from
    the lessons gained and best practices in interoperability, data security, user-centric
    design, and local context concerns (Yin et al. 2022). In order to create a more
    sustainable and interconnected society, AIoT solutions must continue to develop
    and cooperate. Many sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, transportation,
    and more, have been radically altered by AIoT development. This section looks
    at real-world deployments of AIoT technologies in various areas to draw up lessons
    and best practices (Yin et al. 2022). Some globally effective solutions are (Cliff
    et al. 2023; Godager et al. 2021). Accurate farming methods in the USA: Precision
    farming has become more popular in the United States. Farmers use the devices
    like soil sensors, weather stations, and drones to monitor their crops and ensure
    everything is running well. Farmers may improve their irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest management methods with real-time data from these sensors. Sustainable
    agriculture has benefited from increased agricultural yields and more effective
    use of available resources. Norwegian Smart Fishery Management: Norway has introduced
    -based solutions to encourage responsible fishing practices in its fisheries sector.
    AIoT technologies like GPS trackers and sensors are installed aboard fishing boats
    to keep tabs on catch rates, fish stocks, and environmental factors. By using
    this information, authorities can better enforce fishing limits, curb overfishing,
    and safeguard marine ecosystems, assuring the fishing industry''s continued success.
    South Korean smart grids: South Korea''s energy industry has made great efforts
    towards implementing technology. (AIoT) sensors are used in smart grids for real-time
    monitoring of energy usage, distribution optimisation, and problem detection.
    Improved grid efficiency in South Korea has resulted in lower energy costs and
    greater sustainability through lowering energy waste and increasing energy dependability.
    7.1 Best Practices and Real-World Lessons The practices and real-world lessons
    include (Janabi and Kurnaz 2023): Standardisation and Compatibility: Successful
    systems need standardized communication protocols and the ability to easily integrate
    new hardware and software. The easy sharing of data and compatibility across various
    AIoT components are made possible by establishing interoperability. Data Privacy
    and Protection: Sensitive data must be collected and sent securely in AIoT implementations.
    To defend against cyber risks and preserve user privacy, implementers should prioritize
    data encryption, user authentication, and data access restrictions. User-centered
    design: Users are the focus of good design. To increase user adoption and engagement,
    it is important to provide user-friendly interfaces, clear representations, and
    intuitive functionality. Flexibility and scalability: The data volume and the
    number of connected devices are expected to grow over time. Therefore, AIoT implementations
    must be flexible. As a result of its adaptability, new technologies, and future
    growth may be easily included. Consideration of the Local Context: Successful
    installations need adjustments for each unique situation. To provide successful
    solutions, it is essential to appreciate various geographical areas’ specific
    difficulties, cultural subtleties, and infrastructural limitations. Coordination
    and Cooperation: Governments, businesses, universities, and communities all have
    a stake in a successful rollout of the Partners may pool their knowledge, skills,
    and resources through collaboration to create long-lasting improvements. Control
    and Assessment: To determine how successful an AIoT solution is and where it may
    be enhanced, constant monitoring and assessment are required. Insights derived
    from data analysis support continual optimization and enable evidence-based decision-making.
    Instruction and Capacity Development: The knowledge and proficiency of end-users
    and implementers of AIoT technologies may be improved via training and capacity-building
    programs. Building people''s abilities is crucial to ensuring that the solutions
    have the desired effect. 8 Future Trends and Innovations The AIoT has advanced
    swiftly and is continuing to drive innovation. In the not-too-distant future,
    AIoT technologies will merge with AI and machine learning, resulting in unheard-of
    levels of efficiency and automation. The introduction of 5G technology and the
    development of edge computing will also usher in a new era of AIoT applications,
    particularly in the agricultural industry (Saad et al. 2023). Improvements in
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, and edge computing point to a bright
    future for AIoT in agriculture by fueling substantial gains in efficiency, sustainability,
    and production. 5G and edge computing will improve connection and data processing,
    and combining AI and machine learning with AIoT will allow for predictive analytics
    and autonomous systems. Precision farming, smart irrigation, remote monitoring,
    and evidence-based decision-making are just some ways the AIoT will revolutionise
    agriculture and strengthen the foundations of sustainable agriculture worldwide
    (Seyyedabbasi et al. 2023). The potential for innovation and beneficial influence
    on the agricultural business is limitless as these technologies continue to advance.
    The potential impact of 5G and edge computing on AIoT applications in agriculture
    and future trends and breakthroughs in AIoT are discussed. 8.1 Future Trends and
    Innovations in AIoT Increasing connectivity among AIoT devices will provide simple
    two-way communication and data sharing. Because of this enhanced connectedness,
    data analysis and decision-making will become more holistic and integrated. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms will be included into AIoT
    devices, allowing them to analyse and anticipate trends and patterns in real-time
    data (Garg and Goyal 2020). As a result of this capacity, procedures and resource
    allocation may be optimised for greater efficacy. With edge computing, processing
    may be done closer to the data source, which speeds up processing and decreases
    latency. Edge intelligence-equipped AIoT devices will be able to do sophisticated
    tasks locally, cutting down on demand for cloud computing. The AIoT, AI, and ML
    will merge to generate fully autonomous systems. As a result, production will
    rise, human errors will decrease, and efficiency will improve. AIoT will revolutionize
    urban planning and infrastructure management, leading to the construction of smart
    cities with linked transportation, electricity, waste management, and more systems
    (Mousavi et al. 2021). 8.2 Integration of AIoT, AI, and Machine Learning AI and
    ML algorithms will analyze massive volumes of data the AIoT creates. This will
    allow for enhanced knowledge of agricultural procedures and more efficient use
    of available resources (Olan et al. 2022). Precision agriculture will become a
    reality in which farmers administer inputs like water and fertiliser with pinpoint
    accuracy using real-time data and analysis made possible by AI-driven AIoT apps.
    By taking this course of action, both yields and environmental impact may be improved.
    With AI, devices can anticipate when agricultural machinery and equipment need
    repair (Olan et al. 2022; Pan and Zhang 2021). 8.3 The Possible Effect of 5G and
    Edge Computing on Applications in Farming With the increased bandwidth and decreased
    latency that 5G networks provide, the AIoT can communicate with one another in
    near real-time. With the help of 5G and edge computing, farmers can keep an eye
    on their crops and animals without leaving their homes (Rathod et al. 2023). Data-intensive
    AIoT applications, such as high-resolution image and video analytics, will be
    supported by 5G’s fast data rates and the processing capabilities of edge computing,
    enhancing agricultural monitoring and analysis. AIoT-enabled irrigation systems
    with 5G connection and edge computing can optimize water consumption and save
    waste by adjusting the amount of water supplied depending on real-time data, soil
    moisture levels, and weather predictions (Varsha et al. 2021). 9 Conclusion This
    chapter examines the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices via data-driven
    decision-making and precision agriculture on the path to sustainable agriculture
    and food security. Agricultural output, resource effectiveness, and supply chain
    management benefit greatly from AIoT-enabled systems. AIoT improves agricultural
    operations by helping farmers and stakeholders make better choices based on real-time
    data and analytics. Due to the AIoT, farmers can track and manage their crops
    with pinpoint accuracy, improving efficiency, lessening environmental damage,
    and boosting agricultural yields. By allowing farmers to adjust water distribution
    in response to current weather and crop circumstances, smart irrigation systems
    improve water efficiency while decreasing water waste. Better illness diagnosis,
    health assessment, and livestock management contribute to happier, healthier animals.
    A well-oiled supply chain guarantees that food is safe to eat, cuts down on post-harvest
    losses, and speeds up the delivery of crops to consumers. AIoT plays a crucial
    role in developing sustainable agriculture and attaining global food security
    by using real-time data and analytics and closing the information gap between
    farmers, agribusinesses, and consumers. With the ongoing development of AIoT,
    AI, and 5G technologies, the future of AIoT in agriculture seems bright. Data
    security, privacy issues, high implementation costs, and accessibility for small-scale
    farmers in underdeveloped countries are only some of the obstacles that must be
    overcome. Understanding AIoT''s societal and economic effects on agriculture requires
    a study conducted by agronomists, environmentalists, and social scientists. Investing
    in AIoT-related research and development may lead to a future where agriculture
    is more sustainable, productive, and ecologically aware. References Abdullahi

  explanation: The authors present an application of Edge Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) to automatically detect water misuse events through a combination of IoT,
    ML, and Edge Computing. The approach involves training a neural network model
    using data collected from a flow sensor and deploying the model on a low-cost
    microcontroller to perform real-time classification of water usage patterns at
    the edge of the network. This reduces communication load and energy consumption
    while increasing privacy and allowing for decentralized decision-making.

    The digital transformation of agriculture is a promising necessity for tackling
    the increasing nutritional needs of the population on Earth and the degradation
    of natural resources. Focusing on the “hot” area of natural resource preservation,
    the recent appearance of more efficient and cheaper microcontrollers, the advances
    in low-power and long-range radios, and the availability of accompanying software
    tools are exploited in order to monitor water consumption and to detect and report
    misuse events, with reduced power and network bandwidth requirements. Quite often,
    large quantities of water are wasted for a variety of reasons; from broken irrigation
    pipes to people’s negligence. To tackle this problem, the necessary design and
    implementation details are highlighted for an experimental water usage reporting
    system that exhibits Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) functionality. By
    combining modern technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing
    (EC) and Machine Learning (ML), the deployment of a compact automated detection

    Impulse 1. Introduction The degradation of natural resources in quality and quantity
    has a direct impact on the global food production numbers. According to FAO [1],
    the agricultural sector should increase its productivity by 60 per cent to counterbalance
    the depletion of natural resources and the population growth on Earth. The utilization
    of innovative technologies seems to be a key factor for addressing these issues.
    In this regard, toward a successful digital transformation of agriculture, it
    is promising that the rapid development of the electronics industry has managed
    to increase the production numbers and the quality of several components, such
    as microcontroller units (MCUs), single board computers, sensors, and radio transceivers,
    at very affordable cost levels. More specifically, the recently appeared new generation
    of microcontrollers, apart from orchestrating typical sensing and acting tasks,
    can support composite operations at reduced execution times, as they have faster
    and more efficient processors and larger memory. In parallel, the advances in
    radio technology deliver low-power modules capable of long-range communication
    at reduced energy levels. These high-end components are not only widely available
    but are also accompanied by very fluent documentation and software tools that
    facilitate their programming, leading to improved implementations. These characteristics
    can lead to a more efficient approach regarding serious problems, such as the
    preservation of natural resources. Nevertheless, any fusion of software and hardware
    elements has first to address potential implementation bottlenecks, prior to the
    delivery of any effective solution. Indeed, as the world will be populated by
    billions of connected devices [2] of limited resources, interacting with the surrounding
    environment and users, the bottleneck will be the increased amount of data traffic
    that could congest the network and generate several latency, reliability and privacy
    problems [3,4]. The deployment of enhanced processing features on Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices, for example Machine Learning (ML), reduces the network congestion
    by allowing computations to be performed close to the data sources, and thus it
    preserves privacy in uploading data, and reduces power consumption for wireless
    transmission to gateways or cloud servers [4]. In this regard, one of the options
    is to run the intelligent algorithms locally on the end devices (e.g., on the
    sensor nodes hardware). If the tasks are performed by smaller devices, less power
    will be required to keep them running and more flexible energy management will
    be applied, compared with the typical central system case. Small devices can operate
    on batteries for months or even for years, while a diverse set of energy harvesting
    options is offered for elongated operation duration. Thankfully, the recent technological
    advances delivered end devices with improved hardware characteristics (i.e., processing
    capabilities and memory size), thus making it possible for these devices to execute
    machine learning algorithms in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Not only
    do the microcontrollers become better performing, but the application of machine
    learning techniques on them, such as the artificial neural networks (ANNs), have
    also become more efficient, due to the improvement of the corresponding software
    platforms and tools. In greater detail, the execution/utilization phase of an
    ANN requires less computational power than its training phase. In fact, during
    the training, a large amount of data is used to calculate the weights and biases
    of the network, and thus a quite powerful machine is needed. Once the learning
    has been completed and the network has been trained, the model can be used for
    inference actions with lower computational requirements [4]. Consequently, the
    AI algorithms can more likely be run on devices with less resources, as microcontrollers,
    allowing local data processing. Nevertheless, as the trained models may still
    remain comparatively heavy for the in situ MCUs, tools such as TensorFlow Lite
    [5], in the context of TinyML [6], make possible the creation of trimmed-down
    versions that can be fit safely in the improved generation of MCUs, but still
    of limited computational and memory capacity. Finally, the improved transmission
    range characteristics of the low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies,
    such as LoRa, perfectly fit to the reduced network traffic profiles [7]. The balanced
    utilization of the discussed technological innovations can deliver applications
    that can be very helpful for solving real-world problems, e.g., the preservation
    of water resources. Water is one of the most critical resources on the Earth as,
    apart from humans, both plants and animals depend on it, while many processes
    from irrigation to washing or food preparation, cannot be accomplished without
    it. Despite its necessity, large amounts of water are being wasted due to a variety
    of reasons, from water pipe or valve failures to human inattention. It is noteworthy
    that according to the World Bank [8], the non-revenue water (NRW) level in developing
    countries ranges from 40% to 50% of the water pumped into the distribution systems.
    Furthermore, 80 per cent of wastewater in the world flows back into the ecosystem
    without being treated or reused, and 70 per cent of the world’s natural wetland
    extent has been lost [9]. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) [9] on water
    and sanitation, adopted by United Nations (UN) Member States as part of the 2030
    Agenda for Sustainable Development [10], highlights in practice the importance
    of the proper water resource management, from both quantitative and qualitative
    perspective. As agriculture remains the largest consumer of water globally, the
    significance of water for keeping the food produce to satisfactory levels is crucial.
    Targeted at the preservation of water resources with emphasis on their impact
    on agriculture, in this work, the pilot implementation of a smart water usage
    alerting system is presented. The whole approach exploits the findings of the
    approach described in [11] toward the delivery of a more compact and efficient
    solution with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. The latter task is addressed
    by utilizing recently-appeared, cost effective but powerful microcontroller boards
    and software, for supporting the in situ machine learning operations, and a low-power
    and long-range radio network technology based on the LoRa protocol. The combination
    of these elements results in reduced power consumption and in less network traffic
    and processing load for the central entities of the network, as the water usage
    classification decisions are taken locally, at the edges of the network, and only
    notification messages have to travel toward the end user. Response times are also
    reduced, while privacy is better preserved. The water usage episodes that the
    smart system had been trained to intercept were of comparatively short duration,
    but the methods being used and the accuracy being achieved make the proposed arrangements,
    only with minor modifications, to be applicable for supporting a wide variety
    of water preservation/misuse detection scenarios. Apart from this introductory
    section, in order to better highlight the main objectives of this research, the
    rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights the motives and
    the challenges behind this work and the design directions being necessary. Section
    3 provides interesting implementation details. Section 4 is dedicated to evaluation
    results and discussion. Finally, Section 5 contains important concluding remarks.
    2. Background and Design Overview 2.1. Motives and Challenges for Agriculture
    Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology that includes devices connected
    to the Internet equipped with sensors, transducers, radio transceivers, and actuators
    comprising a functioning of the whole that gathers, interchanges and responds
    to information [12]. In this regard, the IoT makes agricultural automation more
    efficient, and thus fosters production [13]. Recent works emphasize the contribution
    of the IoT technologies in critical agricultural operations [14,15], including
    precision farming, livestock, and greenhouses, with the irrigation and water management
    activities to be of among the open issues of growing interest [16]. Machine Learning
    (ML) is a very welcome companion for any IoT solution and provides multiple solutions
    to problems that were among the most difficult to be tacked without, some years
    ago. The exploitation of the ML potential by agriculture is a necessity that follows
    several directions [17], even beyond Agriculture 4.0 [18]. The most significant
    advantage of machine learning techniques is that they can provide generally applicable
    solutions, with minor human intervention and in a way that does not require meticulous
    a priori knowledge of the idiosyncracies of the system the solution is being tailored
    for. This makes satisfactorily-working solutions to be generated easily and quickly
    by people with less expertise in a specific area. Apparently, the role of the
    “experts” of the sector cannot be overlooked, but their involvement into the whole
    process remains consulting and supervising, as they do not have to inject “magic”
    threshold values into conventional and difficult to maintain blocks of code. The
    Edge Computing (EC) is a newcomer to the equation of tackling modern problems
    more efficiently using IoT and ML. Indeed, a traditional IoT solution (a few years
    ago) typically required a large amount of real-time sensor data to be destined
    to a central computer entity in the cloud which in its turn had to process this
    increased amount of data, to take the necessary decisions and probably had to
    deliver the corresponding responses back to the appropriate nodes. This organization
    had to tackle high communication and processing loads, while any potential failure
    of the central entity would result in total system collapse. Furthermore, data
    privacy concerns were also very reasonable, as third-party communication, storage
    and/or decision entities had to get involved in the whole process. On the contrary,
    by increasing the intelligence at the edges of the network (i.e., on or nearby
    the sensor nodes), decisions and any potential action are addressed locally, in
    a faster, cheaper and more private way, thus leaving considerably less (or none
    at all) work for the central entity [4,19]. Typically, only sporadic metadata
    information updates are necessary toward the central entity, mainly for supervision
    purposes. The enrichment of IoT with Edge Computing and Machine Learning functionality
    is often referred as Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) and tries to exploit
    the advantages of these technologies, for serving a wide set of applications in
    a better manner, with the agricultural sector not to be an exception [20]. In
    this regard, the approach being presented is trying to highlight how these elements
    of innovation can be combined to ease the intense problem of water resource waste.
    Demographics continue changing and unsustainable economic practices are affecting
    the quantity and quality of the water being available, thus making it an increasingly
    scarce and expensive resource [9]. Inevitably, water is at the core of sustainable
    development and is closely linked to poverty reduction and climate change. As
    agriculture remains the largest consumer of water globally and irrigation is responsible
    for 70% of its use worldwide, water is the most valuable resource for keeping
    the quality and the quantity of plant and animal production to satisfactory levels.
    The way water is utilized for both urban and rural use directly impacts its future
    availability and thus, emphasis must be placed on water management and irrigation
    efficiency and make sure clean water can be provided for all people. Apart from
    the more conventional bare IoT solutions for water resource management and utilization,
    mainly with focus on agriculture, there is a growing interest for the exploitation
    of ML in order to achieve better results [21,22,23,24]. The fusion with Edge AI
    functionality has yet a lot to offer. The potential exploitation of modern microcontrollers
    for water usage related applications with embedded ML functionality has already
    started delivering interesting outcomes [25], in neighboring scientific areas,
    with the selection of devices and functions for communication between sensor appliances
    to remain a key challenge [26] for success. On the other hand, recent studies
    show that farmers are still facing concerns for adopting the IoT technologies
    in their everyday activities. This skepticism is attributed to a variety of reasons,
    from privacy concerns due the cloud-based nature of many solutions to fears for
    job cuts and for high purchase and maintenance costs [27,28], while it is really
    hard to find experts having the necessary set of talents at a satisfactory degree
    and being available for fluent cooperation, at the same time. Furthermore, while
    the machine learning methods seem to provide accurate and less expensive solutions
    [23] for water misuse detection events such as leaks, there is enough room for
    further improvements. Indeed, due to the very recent character of the innovative
    hardware and software components supporting in situ (i.e., on-device node) machine
    learning techniques, in the agricultural sector for water utilization report/classification
    purposes, few works combine these assets toward the delivery of a cost effective
    and efficient solution with Edge AI characteristics. There are research contributions
    that exploit IoT infrastructures for water monitoring purposes, but without incorporating
    AI functionality [29] or there are contributions that exploit machine learning
    methods that either require central processing of the data being collected [30,31]
    or that they are not optimized to be executed by the new low-cost and high-efficiency
    microcontrollers [32]. These remarks are in line with recent review findings in
    agriculture [24] and reflect a problem already specified in the wider IoT area
    [4,33]. Trying to bridge this gap, the proposed solution indicates that, for water
    usage characterization/report delivery, a quite accurate model can now be trained,
    using flexible tools, be executed on the end device and communicate its classification
    reports using almost negligible power and bandwidth resources. Combining decentralized
    intelligence and low-cost design, provision is made for reduced to null amount
    of information to travel toward the cloud. These arrangements are addressing data
    privacy and reliability issues as well. 2.2. Functionality Overview and Component
    Selection This section reports briefly on the components being selected as well
    as on their role, in order to develop a system capable of intercepting and characterizing
    water usage events. This system includes sensor nodes, placed in situ, at the
    edge points where the water is actually being used, as well as the suitable sink/gateway
    node(s) able to collect the reports delivered by the aforementioned peripheral
    nodes. The “key” point of the approach being presented is that the edge (sensor)
    nodes, apart from collecting time series corresponding to events containing the
    instantaneous water consumption data, are “smart” enough to classify these events
    into categories of proper or improper use of water, without assistance from external
    entities. Thus, via this “filtering”, only the classification reports have to
    travel toward the gateway and the cloud (if the latter is necessary). The analytical
    (low quality and high volume) information of the instantaneous water consumption
    might flood the network infrastructures and exhaust the batteries of the edge
    nodes. The user can easily monitor the operation of the whole system via their
    portable equipment (e.g., their tablet, smart phone, or laptop) using conventional
    connectivity options (e.g., Wi-Fi or 3G/4G), either locally or remotely (e.g.,
    via a virtual private networking (VPN) service). The proposed architecture is
    depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Functionality overview of the proposed water usage
    event characterization solution. The proposed implementation exploited the experience
    gained during the activities described in [11] with the excellent Arduino Nano
    33 BLE Sense [34] microcontroller that offers plenty of sensors and connectivity
    options, but utilized an even newer generation of cheaper microcontroller modules
    that were able to host and to execute composite machine learning algorithms, at
    the same price levels with the “traditional” units. For this reason, the Raspberry
    Pi Pico [35] microcontroller board (that costs about 6€) was selected, which,
    apart from its very attractive price, has fluent processing power and memory (due
    to its new RP2040 chip). More specifically, the Raspberry Pi Pico unit, grace
    at its new RP2040 chip, has fluent processing power and memory, that allows for
    larger and faster program execution compared to the typical Arduino Uno [36] standard,
    as it exhibits 64 times more flash memory (i.e., program memory), 128 times more
    random access memory (RAM) and a much faster dual-core processor. Consequently,
    the Raspberry Pi Pico board was able to support, apart from the basic water consumption
    metering process, the necessary machine learning functionality to invoke the corresponding
    water usage alert message generation. For the final deployment, the absence of
    a radio interface on the Raspberry Pi Pico unit was counterbalanced by the adoption
    of a cost effective microcontroller board, running at 8 MHz and equipped with
    a LoRa radio, namely a LoRa32u4 unit [37]. For programming both systems, the preferred
    option was the well-supported Arduino IDE [38] environment. During the implementation
    and testing stages, an ESP8266 based module [39], namely an ESP-01 unit, offering
    Wi-Fi connectivity, was utilized. The water flow meter device is a Hall-effect
    counter sensor (YF-S201 [40] model), which can detect the flow changes as the
    water passes through it and the rotor rolls. Furthermore, the MIT App Inventor
    cloud-based programming environment [41] was selected for the easy creation of
    a mobile application for inspecting the water usage activity, via the smart phone/tablet
    device of the user. To add machine learning functionality, it was necessary to
    prepare and incorporate a trained artificial neural network (ANN) model into the
    software running on the Raspberry Pi Pico. An artificial neural network is based
    on the operation of neurons in the human brain. This structure has one input layer,
    one or more hidden layers, being interconnected, and an output layer for delivering
    the results. A very simple and efficient manner to prepare (i.e., to train and
    to extract/compile) a suitable ANN model was the Edge Impulse [42] cloud environment.
    The latter processing environment incorporates the functionality of the TensorFlow
    Lite engine for training neural networks. More specifically, it is equipped with
    fluent graphical interface and network connectivity options for importing sensor
    data, designing the ANN model, applying assistive processing blocks, for creating,
    testing and deploying the final version of it. Finally, the coefficients describing
    the ANN are stored in the memory of the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, and
    thus the AI algorithm can be executed on a device with comparatively low but enough
    capacity, in terms of processing power and RAM. The Edge Impulse platform, from
    February of 2022, provides full support from the Raspberry Pi Pico board. The
    gateway node, gathers the classification decision information from the peripheral
    (edge) sensor nodes, stores and makes it available for the end device (e.g., smart
    phone, tablet or laptop) of the user, via common network services installed on
    it, or posts the information to the cloud, for better visualization and post-processing.
    Details referred to the latter choice are beyond the scope of this research work.
    3. Implementation Details In accordance with the design and functionality directions
    provided in Section 2.2, Section 3 is dedicated in presenting characteristic details
    of the implementation process. The analytic steps being followed for the training
    are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. The analytic steps being necessary for
    the training of the proposed water usage event characterization solution. More
    specifically, the basic water flow sensing unit connection and programming arrangements
    are highlighted, in order to gather efficient data for training the ANN model
    (step 1), and thus, to add machine learning capabilities to the whole system.
    The details for this training are also explained (steps 2 and 3), as well as the
    incorporation of the trained ANN model into the microcontroller of the flow-metering
    system (step 4) for enhancing its functionality. In parallel, the corresponding
    network node(s) arrangements are discussed, as well as the characteristics of
    a pairing end-user mobile application, for the delivery of a fluently working
    solution. 3.1. Initial Sensor Node Preparation The Raspberry Pi Pico is a 3.3
    V level unit, for this reason, the flow sensor was connected to its 3.3 V supply
    pin, in order to generate 3.3 V logic compatible pulse signals to its output.
    The 3.3 V level was adequate for the operation of the specific flow metering device
    being selected. Furthermore, the output of the latter sensor was connected with
    an interrupt (input) digital pin of the microcontroller, and the ground pins of
    both components were also wired together. The sensor was connected to a testing
    tap via a pipe, and thus, it could be exposed to a variety of water consumption
    scenarios potentially being invoked by human, according to empirical assumptions.
    The Arduino IDE environment was customized properly by downloading and installing
    the necessary libraries corresponding to the Raspberry Pi Pico, according to the
    instructions of the its official page, for facilitating the programming process
    of the microcontroller, via a computer through a USB port connection. The pulses
    that the flow sensor was generating correspond to the rotations of its blades
    and thus to the water flow passing through it. More specifically, according to
    the basic algorithm, as the flow sensor signal generated a pulse signal any time
    2.22 mL water quantity, approximately, passed through it, the Raspberry Pi Pico
    intercepted these pulses as interrupt triggers to be counted and, in turn, calculated
    an one-second average value corresponding to the water flow (in mL). The sequence
    of these flow values was output to the serial port of the microcontroller. After
    compiling the program (sketch) and uploading it to the Raspberry Pi Pico board,
    the sequence of the flow measurements was acquired via the USB cable. The latter
    measurements were fed into the machine learning platform, in order to train the
    suitable ANN model, as the Edge Impulse environment offers options for automated
    uploading of the values being measured. 3.2. Training the Neural Network The corresponding
    ANN model to be generated had to be simple and lightweight enough for the microcontroller’s
    potential but still precise enough. In this regard, the system was trained to
    recognize three characteristic kinds of water utilization profiles: the Normal
    Use or NU, Water Leak or WL and Water Waste or WW. The proper training of an ANN
    requires data series corresponding to each of these categories to be collected
    and to be uploaded to the Edge Impulse engine. The total data length was 5 h 55
    min 47 s (148 files) for all three cases. According to Edge Impulse platform requirements,
    the duration of the data length had to be approximately the same for all categories,
    in order for the final model to be more accurate. Nevertheless, the number of
    profiles for each case may differ (NU: 69, WL: 44, WW: 44 profiles). During the
    profile collection process, the lowest flow value that the flow sensor could record
    was about 10–15 mL/s, while the maximum flow being recorded was in the range between
    250 and 280 mL/s. The network was trained using empirical data based on human
    observations for classifying samples (water usage episodes) into categories. In
    general, NU profiles were created so as to contain low to moderate flow values
    and having duration below 180 s, making the training pattern hypothesis that a
    non-WL water usage scenario would last for 3 min at maximum. Similarly, it was
    assumed that WL profiles exhibited continuous flow duration of more than 180 s
    and that most WW profiles had flow consumption over 160 mL/s and duration of more
    than 160 s, as it would be more likable for the classification experiment, during
    the episodes to use water for shorter time and at lower flow rate. Some typical
    profiles for each category are given in Figure 3, where the water flow was measured
    in ml/s and the time was measured in seconds (s). For each category, there is
    a diversification among the profiles being recorded and fed to the training system.
    This diversification results in increased accuracy under real-world conditions.
    Figure 3. (a,b) Normal Use profiles; (c,d) Water Leak profiles; (e,f) Water Waste
    profiles. In the next stage, the water flow data (raw data) were uploaded to the
    Edge Impulse cloud platform, via the Data Acquisition menu category, and were
    split into training and testing data, automatically, while the data labelling
    was performed manually. For training of the ANN model, the window size was set
    at 200,000 ms (i.e., 200 s), according to the profiles that were fed into the
    training system and by taking into consideration the maximum time that a person
    might use the tap. Similarly, the window increase was set at 1000 ms (i.e., at
    1 s) and the frequency at 1 Hz (i.e., for 1 sps sampling rate). Furthermore, “Raw
    Data” was selected as the preferred processing block and “Classification (Keras)”
    as the ANN learning block. The option “Raw Data” means that no additional prepossessing
    was made (e.g., a spectral characteristics extraction) before using the original
    data for the training process. This option does not reduce the number of features
    to be fed to the input layer of the network, but also preserves as many characteristics
    of the initial data as possible and, as it is explained right below, it fits easily
    in the microcontroller being selected. Furthermore, the number of training cycles
    was set to the moderate value of 50, to avoid overfitting, and the learning rate
    at 0.0005, via the NN Classifier configuration section, as the Edge Impulse suggests.
    The final neural network structure has an input layer with 200 features (window
    size), two hidden layers, with the first one to have 20 neurons and the second
    one 10 neurons, and an output layer with 3 classes (NU, WL, WW). This architecture
    for the NN provided an optimal combination between performance and computer resource
    allocation (i.e., model accuracy versus time needed for a decision to be made
    and memory size needed for hosting the program in the flash and for executing
    it in RAM). For the specific model, in the quantized version, the RAM usage was
    1.9 KB and the flash memory usage was 22.5 KB, values that are far below the capacity
    limit of the Raspberry Pi Pico unit. It must be noted though that during the actual
    operation of the microcontroller, more memory will be needed as along with the
    NN model coexist several variables and code parts dedicated to other tasks. The
    Edge Impulse platform allows for easy experimentation with various candidate settings
    and for saving the model with the best performance after the end of the training
    process. Finally, there is the option to download the model from the Edge Impulse
    cloud platform, via the “Deployment” section of Edge Impulse menu category, as
    code that includes library and sketches to be compiled and uploaded to the microcontroller
    via the Arduino IDE environment. 3.3. Sensor Node Software Enhancement As explained
    in Section 3.2, the code generated by the Edge Impulse platform, in the form of
    a generic Arduino library, provides customizable examples (sketches) for the Arduino
    environment, with the Raspberry Pi Pico board to be among the models being supported,
    and thus, being compatible with the generated model parameters. The selection
    of the “Arduino library” option (instead of the tailored firmware output one)
    provides freedom to combine the machine learning engine with further algorithmic
    behaviors being necessary to be executed by the hosting microcontroller. In this
    regard, the final software running on the microcontroller had to be updated so
    as to be able to perform (almost simultaneously) some simple but sharp calculations/tasks
    of different time granularity: Intercept the interrupt signals corresponding to
    the rotor roll pulses of the water flow sensor module; Calculate the instantaneous
    water consumption, at a fixed and specific rate, typically 1 or 2 times per second,
    update the aggregate metrics, and trigger the classification process every time
    the predefined number of samples (i.e., 200) was gathered; Deliver system status
    data and water usage reports via USB to the hosting computer, or wirelessly to
    a gateway node or to the operator’s smart phone/tablet; As expected, the above
    tasks had to be performed without blocking or delaying each other, constraints
    that required meticulous programming (e.g., using timer events) to achieve fluent
    operation. Optimally, the delivery of information toward the gateway had to take
    place once, after the end of each classification process utilizing the 200 consecutive
    samples. Nevertheless, for debugging or training purposes, all 200 values had
    to be transmitted toward the gateway node. Communication with the LoRa32u4 radio
    module was achieved through the serial TTL level port of the microcontroller.
    3.4. Gateway Node and User-End Software For the reception (and the inspection)
    of the remote alerts through Wi-Fi, an android smart phone or a tablet device,
    which most modern people are familiar with, was a satisfactory solution. The MIT
    App Inventor environment was utilized in order to deploy a simple monitoring application.
    The necessary programming was completed using visual blocks, based on the information
    provided in [43,44]. The initial deployment involved direct connection between
    the smart water sensor node and the end user equipment (e.g., a tablet device),
    typically through a Wi-Fi connection link. This solution is not optimal if multiple
    sensors units exist and deliver water usage reports in parallel. Furthermore,
    the latter sensors may be placed at comparatively long distances from the user.
    These facts made necessary the development of a gateway/sink node to gather the
    corresponding data and the migration to LoRa radio links. For implementing the
    latter gateway node, a Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ had been selected [45], due to
    its reduced size and energy footprint and its fluent programming and interfacing
    options. The Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ unit allows for fast implementation of code
    that intercepts the data reports from the peripheral smart sensor nodes, storing
    them into files or a simple database, and making them available via the proper
    TCP/IP based service. This request could be either asynchronous or periodic (i.e.,
    generated by a proper application running on the user’s mobile phone). These tasks
    are served using python and Linux shell scripts, inter process communication (IPC)
    techniques exploiting IP sockets, and the activation of preexisting applications
    such as the Apache web server, the SSH server and/or a Virtual Private Networking
    (VPN) service. Furthermore, the gateway node, properly combined with VPN networking
    techniques, assured monitoring functions from distant locations, based on the
    availability of Wide Area Network (WAN) wired or wireless technologies (i.e.,
    3G/4G, DSL, etc.). 3.5. Summary of IoT Deployment Steps The Edge AI tasks had
    to be performed fluently, while deployment in open-field environments using long-range
    radios, such as LoRa, was an important priority. The final functionality being
    implemented can be summarized in the following steps/cases: Use a Wi-Fi radio
    transceiver (e.g., an ESP-01 module), attached to the sensor node, to provide
    communication between the sensor node and the user’s smart phone/tablet, for testing
    purposes, during the initial deployment; Use a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ and a LoRa
    radio module as a LoRa gateway/web server, in conjunction with the LoRa radio
    transceiver modules being attached to the (preferably more than one) smart sensor
    nodes; Increase user-friendliness by adding services using the Raspberry Pi Model
    3 A+ unit of the gateway node and well-known web-based applications. Case 1 was
    suitable for verifying the basic wireless connectivity potential of the sensor
    node via the tablet/smart phone device of the user, being nearby the sensor. This
    arrangement made easy for the user to inspect the status of the water activity
    characterization system for one smart sensor and from short distances. The need
    to have a more complete on-demand view of the status of more than one water use
    points, at increased distance, was favoring the adoption of a local gateway node
    facilitating the whole monitoring process, as explained in case 2. The sensor
    nodes were sending water usage notifications toward this local gateway, over LoRa.
    It must be noted though that the TCP/IP technology, as a solution for the delivery
    of data (i.e., the sporadic metadata) from the sensors to the gateway, is not
    optimal, in terms of energy consumption, complexity and range coverage. Indeed,
    in a typical application scenario, the distance between the sensor nodes and the
    gateway node is limited to a hundred meters, approximately. If willing to extend
    this distance to the kilometer range or beyond, without special and expensive
    equipment, transceivers utilizing technologies such as LoRa are more suitable.
    In case of the LoRa solution, the LoRa32u4 board, as a transceiver, was the optimal
    selection for both the sensor and gateway nodes, due to its low cost and its easy
    programming. The RadioHead software package [46] is a very efficient library that
    supports several critical LoRa protocol functions, and thus, it was adopted for
    adjusting the LoRa32u4 modules. These modules were programmed easily via the Arduino
    IDE environment. Consequently, the microcontroller of each sensor node was connected
    (typically via its hardware serial TTL interface) with a LoRa32u4 board in order
    to relay the water usage information from the machine learning engine toward the
    gateway node. A Lora32u4 board was also connected via USB with the Raspberry Pi
    3 Model A+ unit implementing the gateway functions. The necessary code was written
    in python to bridge the serial port of the LoRa32u4 board with an IP socket service
    running on the gateway node. Characteristic deployment arrangements are depicted
    in Figure 4a,b. More specifically, Figure 4a depicts the smart water sensor node
    implementation using a Raspberry Pi Pico unit and a LoRa radio, while in Figure
    4b the gateway/sink node implementation is depicted using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model
    A+ and a LoRa radio. The information exchanged between the LoRa radios was packetized
    and encrypted using the RadioHead library and the Arduino Cryptography Library
    [47], in order to hide the sensitive data from non-authorized users. Figure 4.

    (b) Gateway/sink node implementation using Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ and LoRa radio.
    Initial experiments were performed using USB powering via the hosting computer
    and/or power banks. Later updates included LiPo or Li-ion batteries, mainly of
    18650 type which are cheap and robust, as well as small photovoltaic panels (e.g.,
    2 W units). It must be noted though that the absence of a permanent power supply
    source nearby is not always the rule, and thus the operation of the alerting system
    was facilitated. 4. Results and Evaluation This work is putting emphasis on intercepting
    water usage events and on characterizing them properly. Via fluently-working machine
    learning techniques, applied at the edges of the network, the amount of information
    that needs to travel from the peripheral nodes to the central node and the cloud
    is minimized. This fact signifies reduced communication load and energy consumption,
    and better autonomy and privacy. The adoption of simple, long-range and low-energy
    radios facilitates the whole process. Relevant details are given into the following
    Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3 and Section 4.4. 4.1. Testing the Acuracy
    of the Model For classification evaluation algorithms, accuracy is the most frequently
    used indicator, and it is defined as the proportion of the correctly classified
    samples to the total number of samples. After the training process, based on the
    testing data, the system generated the right outcome for the NU category with
    77.8% accuracy. Similarly, for the WW and WL categories, 100% success was achieved,
    according to Edge Impulse cloud environment. These performance results made the
    final model to have a 98.5% expected accuracy, using the testing data set, in
    the Quantized (int8) version. At next stage, actual water consumption episodes
    of known type (i.e., NU, WW or WL) had to be invoked, by rotating the tap head
    properly, thus letting the proposed machine learning engine to perform classification
    according to the flow data being collected (i.e., in chunks of 200 consecutive
    values). The corresponding results were recorded. Figure 5 depicts the proposed
    sensor node connected in-line with a water tap. This process was matching the
    steps being followed during the training stage of the system. Figure 5. The proposed
    sensor node connected in-line with a water tap. It must be noted that the in-parallel
    visual inspection of the ongoing process was drastically facilitating the experiments.
    More specifically, further arrangements were made in order for the whole sequence
    of the analytical flow readings to arrive to the smart phone/tablet device, using
    a modified version of the application created for the end user (as presented in
    Section 3.4). This application variant provided detailed real-time graphs (into
    the form of histograms) reflecting the instantaneous water consumption during
    each episode, for direct comparison and adjustments. Figure 6a–f illustrate indicative
    smart phone screenshots reflecting typical water usage characterization decisions
    during the actual testing process, corresponding to the NU, WL and WW categories,
    respectively. Figure 6. (a–f) Indicative smart phone screenshots during the in
    situ testing process, reflecting typical water usage characterization decisions
    for the categories NU, WL and WW, respectively. The combination of the trained
    ANN model implementation with simple more conventional programming techniques
    was improving the accuracy and the response times of the system being presented.
    For instance, the in situ module logic was modified so as to ignore the zero-flow
    events, as an episode (i.e., event) started being recorded only after the arrival
    of the first non-zero flow value. Table 1 contains the confusion matrix that corresponds
    to the testing of the real system, after classifying 100 water consumption episodes.
    The processing of the data being collected revealed that the actual accuracy was
    91% (i.e., 91 over 100 samples were classified correctly), after testing the model
    with user-generated water consumption profiles, using the proposed smart flow
    metering system. It is important to mention that the model could clearly recognise
    the undesirable WL profiles, achieving accuracy values reaching 100%. On the other
    hand, there were some incorrect predictions, where the neural model was classifying
    an actual WW scenario as NU or WL (with percentages 5.1% and 7.7%, respectively).
    In fewer cases, the model was classifying an NU as WW or WL (with percentages
    equal to 2.8%). These failures can be attributed to the fact that there was a
    small area where the borders of those categories were overlapped, thus confusing
    the neural network classifier. An additional 0.4 certainty threshold was programmed
    on the microcontroller for more reliable characterizations. This performance is
    close to the one expected according to the testing of the model. The overall performance
    is lower than the one achieved by other machine learning approaches [23] using
    more composite systems, but remains high and can be easily achieved by the proposed
    low-cost equipment. The accuracy can be further improved by using more extensive
    training and samples. Table 1. The confusion matrix corresponding to the trained
    neural network model, created by classifying 100 water consumption episodes, of
    specific (and known) type each. 4.2. Networking and Power Consumption Issues According
    to the specifications of the experimental system being presented, although 200
    consecutive samples had to be recorded before a classification decision to be
    make, this decision was taken locally, and thus only the (final) characterization
    message had to travel toward the gateway (and to the end user) instead of 200
    messages containing the corresponding analytical flow values. The packet payload
    information needed to travel from the peripheral sensor nodes toward the gateway
    node did not exceed 10 bytes in binary format, thus resulting in a bellow 50-byte
    description per episode in textual format, in the final log files on the Raspberry
    Pi Model 3 A+ unit of the gateway. The size requirements of the analytical data
    would be roughly 200 times higher. In addition to that, the cost for performing
    the classification at the central node was not necessary any more. Figure 7 provides
    indicative details of the water flow episode/event specific information as stored
    into the log files on the Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ unit implementing the gateway
    node functionality. These files were directly available through the Apache web
    server and typically contained an arrival timestamp, node address, episode type
    (i.e., NU/WW/WL), flow value per each sample into a specific episode (in debug
    mode only), total water consumption per episode, as well as sensor battery voltage
    and RSSI indicator. Figure 7. Characteristic details of the water flow episode/event
    specific information as stored into the log files on the Raspberry Pi Model 3
    A+ unit implementing the gateway node. Some stability problems were experienced
    when using the highest baud rate (i.e., the 115,200 bps value) between the Raspberry
    Pi Pico and the LoRa32u4 module. For this reason the data rate was set to the
    “safe” 38,400 bps value. The techniques being followed for testing the effective
    communication range of the proposed system were utilizing the methods presented
    in [7,48]. The gateway node, apart from the water flow specific information, for
    each node, was collecting assistive data, such as sensor battery status and received
    signal strength indicator (RSSI). The latter information was collected for sensor
    nodes being at various distances from the gateway node, for both Wi-Fi and LoRa
    radio cases. The left part of Figure 8 depicts a LoRa radio transceiver during
    the in situ radio coverage experiments. According to results being gathered, by
    using ESP-01 Wi-Fi transceivers, the maximum range coverage was at about 100 m,
    while by using LoRa modules with custom wire antennas the communication distance
    was extended to 300 m in free space. By using standard but still cheap antennas,
    the LoRa link scenario was easily achieving communication coverage of above 1
    km. These results are justified by the fact that the receiver sensitivity limit
    for nodes equipped with Wi-Fi radios was around −90 dBm, while for the LoRa, the
    sensitivity being achieved was reaching the −130 dBm level. Figure 8. Experiments
    for testing the range coverage (left) and the energy consumption (right) of the
    prototype sensor nodes. In order to better capture and study the short-scale dynamics
    of the smart sensor modes, a measuring circuit was built, according to the directions
    provided in [49]. More specifically, an Arduino Uno board was utilized to calculate
    the voltage drops over a resistor of known value, connected in series with the
    load of interest (i.e., the smart water sensor node); the right part of Figure
    8 depicts the corresponding experimental setup. The actual measuring process was
    performed via a separate ADC module (namely an ADS1015 unit) capable of true differential
    measurements, of satisfactory resolution (i.e., of 12 bits) and of adjustable
    gain. The communication of this module with the hosting Arduino board was completed
    using an I2C interface. The presence of the Arduino Uno unit allowed for the additional
    processing of data and quick graphical inspection. Consequently, for the system
    under testing, amperage consumption traces could be easily captured, at a typical
    time resolution of 100 sps and at an approximate amperage resolution of 1 mA,
    via the Serial Monitor or the Serial Plotter component of the Arduino IDE environment.
    By using the specific measuring setup, several results were collected. The behavior
    of the sensor nodes was on the focus of this study, as, typically, the gateway
    node was considered of having fixed power supply and its consumption was around
    250 mA. More specifically, the consumption of a bare node, equipped only with
    a Raspberry Pi Pico unit was 27 mA, approximately, with the water flow metering
    unit to absorb 3–4 mA of this quantity. When activating the radio modules on the
    system and letting them transmit information, further data were collected. For
    debugging purposes, apart from the standard settings where only the water usage
    decision was reported, the analytical flow data could also be transmitted toward
    the gateway, limited only by the maximum data rate being supported by the selected
    radio modules. Referring to the Wi-Fi communication case, Figure 9 provides characteristic
    details of the short time dynamics of the scanning and connection establishment
    stages that were mandatory before the utilization of the radio modules. The inspection
    of the results revealed that the scanning process was extremely energy-consuming,
    reaching the level of 90 mA (in total) with additional and non-negligible sporadic
    spikes exceeding that level. The whole scanning process lasted for 2 to 3 s, and
    after that, the overall consumption was stabilized to the 40 mA level, with peaks
    of additional 50 mA corresponding to the water flow event reports toward the gateway.
    The high cost for the Wi-Fi initialization link (especially in optimized radio
    sleep/wakeup scenarios), along with its limited range coverage were favoring the
    assessment of other communication alternatives, such as LoRa. Figure 9. Short
    time dynamics of the mandatory scanning and connection establishment stages, following
    the activation of the Wi-Fi radio module that smart sensors were equipped with.
    Similarly, Figure 10 depicts characteristic short-time dynamics for the LoRa communication
    alternative. Namely, from the LoRa module activation (left) to the energy peaks
    reflecting the water usage notification packet transmission events (top right)
    and to the corresponding textual information content as intercepted by the gateway
    (bottom right). The LoRa32u4 LoRa board consumed 12–13 mA, approximately, at idling,
    with the radio enabled, while the transmission events at the standard radio parameter
    settings (i.e., having Coding Rate—CR set to 4/5, Bandwidth—BW to 128 kHz, Spreading
    Factor—SF set to 7) and with the transmit power at 15 dBm, resulted in spikes
    of 70 mA (at 3.3 V), having an approximate duration of 50 ms, thus requiring around
    12 mJ each. It must be noted that the whole process lacked the high connection
    establishment cost (in both time and energy) characterizing the Wi-Fi case. The
    tradeoff of LoRa was the far lower communication rate, which was not an issue
    for the specific application case that only a few bytes had to be transmitted
    per sensor unit, every 2 to 3 min, at the fastest utilization activity scenario.
    Figure 10. Characteristic short-time dynamics for the LoRa communication alternative:
    From the LoRa module activation (left) to the energy peaks reflecting the packet
    transmission events (top right) and to the corresponding textual information content
    as intercepted by the gateway (bottom right). According to the overall performance
    description presented herein, it can be inferred that typically, the benefits
    of the pilot implementation being discussed were maximized in application cases
    where many water consumption check points were needed, spread into an area of
    a few kilometres. 4.3. Node Cost Issues The total cost of each of the discussed
    nodes, after adding the 6€ for the Raspberry Pi Pico unit, the 15€ for the LoRa
    equipped module, the 8€ for the YF-S201 flow sensor, the 8€ for LiPo batteries
    and the 5€ needed for a good-quality plastic enclosure box, was around 42€. The
    utilization of a LoRa transceiver instead of a typical Wi-Fi radio saved energy
    and offered improved distance coverage. The decision of using the LoRa32u4 board
    added some extra cost (of about 5€, compared with a bare LoRa chip) but provided
    further GPIO pins and connectivity options, as well as fast programming and testing
    of the diverse communication and arithmetic processing variants, thus counterbalancing
    the almost 15 min of time required for the compilation of the code containing
    the trained neural network model destined for the Raspberry Pi Pico unit. The
    gateway node needed 30€ for a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+, 15€ for the LoRa32u4 board,
    5€ for a plastic enclosure box, and 5€ for a power supply, resulting in cost below
    60€. 4.4. Further Discussion This work presented a pilot implementation targeted
    at intercepting water usage events and characterizing them properly, with the
    emphasis to be put on misuse cases, such as leakages or wastes. The rapid growth
    of electronics and of the pairing software allowed for very cost-effective but
    efficient solutions, with cutting-edge features. Indeed, the adoption of machine
    learning techniques at the edge points (i.e., where the water sensors are) was
    drastically reducing the amount of information that needed to travel from the
    peripheral nodes to the central node and the cloud. This fact resulted in reduced
    communication load and energy consumption, while it increased autonomy and privacy.
    The focus was put on the in situ processing and the pairing with simple, long-range
    and low-energy radios, e.g., the LoRa technology ones. The water usage episodes
    the experimental system was trained to intercept were of comparatively short duration,
    but the software and hardware methods being used, and the accuracy being achieved,
    make the proposed arrangements, only with minor configuration modifications, to
    be applicable for supporting a wide variety of water preservation/misuse detection
    scenarios. Apparently, several issues are still open, requiring more elaboration
    for the delivery of an out-of-the-box solution. The time interval between the
    fixed, in number (e.g., 200), consecutive flow data required for a characterization
    decision, was set to 1 s during the training. The same trained model, can still
    be valid considering intervals of much longer value (e.g., of 30 s instead of
    1 s), provided that the proper normalization in flow values will be made and that
    the activity will be classified in following the same pattern. Nevertheless, gathering
    richer data sets, reflecting further realistic use cases, can train the model
    more accurately, and is an apparent priority for wider applicability. This training
    can follow the same generic principles and methods described herein. The option
    of using a bare LoRa chip with the Raspberry Pi Pico unit is amongst the future
    priorities toward a more commercially-friendly version of the prototype presented
    herein. While the adoption of the LoRa protocol allows for better flexibility,
    the LoRaWAN solution is also feasible, either via implementing the necessary protocol
    stack, via software on the 32u4 LoRa board, or by utilizing native LoRaWAN chips.
    Furthermore, these processes can become more efficient by introducing a sleep/wakeup
    energy management schema which will allow the Raspberry Pi Pico to wake up (via
    interrupts) whenever water flow activity is intercepted by the flow sensor. The
    task of the efficient powering the system at the absence of permanent power supply
    nearby is also quite challenging. Indeed, more than one alternative can be adopted,
    from using solar panels or a tiny wind generator, to pairing the rotating blades
    of the flow sensor unit with a tiny electric generator [50]. Finally, as the adoption
    of a Raspberry Pi Model 3 A+ as a central/gateway node was providing an adequate
    but poor level of functionality, via elementary web and archiving or database
    services, linking with well-known and more user-friendly cloud services is also
    a case worth investigating in the future. 5. Conclusions In this paper, the synergy
    between several innovative and low-cost electronic components and software was
    exploited, in order to monitor and remotely report characteristic water consumption/misuse
    events. The whole approach introduces modern Edge AI techniques (i.e., combining
    IoT, ML and Edge Computing principles) that up until recently was not possible
    to be executed with traditional low-cost microcontrollers. The challenges for
    the delivery of a generally applicable and inexpensive alerting system for either
    urban or rural water resource usage were further highlighted. The system being
    presented can work in a decentralized manner as the amount of information that
    has to travel from the edges to the cloud is drastically reduced, or becomes practically
    unnecessary, thus resulting in energy requirement minimization and increased privacy.
    Only the final decision (water usage characterization) information has to be transmitted
    to the final user (e.g., the farmer), and the cloud is necessary only in case
    that the latter user is not nearby or asks for sophisticated information post
    processing. As for the future, more optimized variants of the proposed system
    will be assessed, in terms of hardware selection (e.g., of flow sensor units),
    neural network model accuracy, networking options and energy autonomy. Great companies,
    such as Arduino, Raspberry, ESP or Adafruit, during their noble competition, will
    continue to produce excellent parts with leveraged application support potential.
    Finally, an out-of-the box version of the functionality being presented, of commercial
    standards, exploiting additional well-known services, and thus exhibiting increased
    user-friendliness, will be a significant future priority. Author Contributions

    I. Introduction The agricultural sector consumes more than 70% of freshwater [1].
    While irrigating the crops, underwatering and overwatering are one of the pressing
    issues [2]. Overwatering causes the reduction of overall freshwater and causes
    the damage of crop roots, soil runoff, mineral runoff, and algal bloom to nearby
    freshwater sources [3], [4]. Precise and accurate irrigation is the smart way
    to avoid all these problems. Although IoT-based smart sprinklers have been developed
    in irrigation [5], [6], [7]. When used over a large area of farmland, however,
    the significant setup costs, additional recalibrating time, and additional issues
    make this strategy inefficient [7]. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have become
    a popular and affordable technology in recent years for capturing high-resolution
    remote sensing images for various precision agriculture applications. Drones have
    been used in agriculture for decades to spray pesticides, seeding, plant health
    monitoring, crop management [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and production cost management
    [13], [14]. Drone imaging is combined with artificial intelligence for better
    accuracy [15]. Contactless Thermal Infrared imagery is an effective way to characterize
    the temperature variations of agricultural fields. TIR imaging has been used to
    find the kangaroos in Australia [16] and spider monkeys in Mexico [17]. Using
    TIR images, nesting bird habitats have been identified [18]. TIR images are used
    to evaluate forest ecosystems [19], archaeological sites [20], [21], [22] and
    Photovoltaic installations [23]. UAV-based TIR imaging technology is also used
    to detect compost pile conditions [24], peat fire detection [25], find mesocarnivores
    animals in farmland [26], search and rescue missions [27] and so on. Overwatering
    and crop irrigation issues can be solved more effectively with the help of a drone
    equipped with a thermal infrared camera. We used UAV based imaging to generate
    the thermal map of an area within minutes which in turn was used to control smart
    water sprinklers. A machine learning model trained using the image processing
    of TIR images, flight data, primary agricultural data, and methodological parameters
    such as geological location, soil moisture absorption, wind, and weather data
    can be used to predict the moisture content of each spot and choose appropriate
    sprinkler parameters. The nearby sprinkles can irrigate that dry area based on
    the ML decision generated and transmitted by the terrestrial edge station. Shorter
    running times and less water consumption are the results of carefully managed
    irrigation systems [16]. Irrigating in a circular pattern can be enabled by sprinklers
    with revolving nozzles [28]. Several smart irrigation models have been developed
    based on thermal imaging [29]. The entire farm area can be divided into small
    sectors. We adopted the sector division techniques of cellular communication,
    which divide a large segment into smaller circular segments [30], [31]. The smart
    sprinklers are placed at the center of each sector, which can hydrate a radius
    of 10–20 m. However, circular sections can create considerable overlaps. Hence,
    we approximated each sector as a hexagon, which has an equivalent area of 82%
    of a circular area, resulting in less overlapping of the irrigated land. The TIR
    and RGB images taken by the drone are processed using an onboard edge intelligence.
    The images processed using the onboard drone edge AI are converted into georeferenced
    data, which is then sent to the terrestrial edge unit using LoRa WAN communication.
    The terrestrial edge station generates the irrigation pattern using a trained
    machine learning model. This decision and irrigation pattern are transmitted to
    the smart sprinklers through LoRa WAN communication. Wi-Fi, ZigBee, NRF24L01 RF
    communication-based smart sprinklers are commonly used in short to midrange IoT
    smart irrigation [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. These cost-effective communication
    methods work well with a mid-range distance, around 100 meters, without an external
    antenna [38], [39], [40]. These communication methods can be upgraded with a dedicated
    antenna to achieve a distance of a few hundred meters. The LoRa WAN communication
    is suited for a large area because of its broad coverage of a few kilometers without
    secondary repeaters, reducing communication complexity and an initial setup cost
    [40], [41], [42]. Smart sprinkles can be powered by a solar panel that completely
    avoids batteries. Solar pumping without batteries has shown success in good sunlight
    [43], [44] Even while cloud computing has a great degree of scalability and is
    inexpensive, it has a significant latency and puts a lot of strain on the network’s
    bandwidth. For making the proposed system to be efficient and reliable, latency
    should be as low as possible. Edge computation is integrated into the system [45],
    [46], [47]. Edge computing, as defined by the Edge Computing Consortium (ECC),
    is a distributed open platform that integrates network, storage, and application
    capabilities at the network edge, near the objects or data sources [48]. Data
    processing under this computing paradigm does not need to send information to
    the cloud or other distant centralized or distributed systems. Edge intelligence
    is the next evolution of edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI). It intends
    to empower the edge by utilizing AI technologies [49]. Typical edge computing
    systems feature graphics units and CPUs to efficiently handle the trained ML model
    inside the standalone computational device. The clustering of computing resources
    in the edge system enables parallel processing of the overall task, which reduces
    latency and enables handling of complex tasks like image processing, machine learning,
    and deep learning within the cluster itself [50]. A. Proposed Drone-Aided Edge
    Computing Architecture The drone-aided smart irrigation system, shown in Figure
    1, is designed to accurately irrigate a farm area and lessen excessive freshwater
    use. The entire system consists of two subunits: aerial and terrestrial. The aerial
    unit has an autonomous drone in which the aerial edge computing station captures
    and processes thermal images and transfers the decision to the terrestrial sector
    through LoRa WAN communication. Terrestrial edge station, smart sprinklers, hydration
    pumps, and drone takeoff pads are in the terrestrial unit. FIGURE 1. System representation
    based on each level management. Show All The terrestrial edge can generate an
    irrigation pattern based on the georeferenced data from the drone. The machine
    learning (ML) model at the terrestrial edge server can generate an irrigation
    pattern and set the sprinkler parameters such as flow rate and flow direction
    in order to irrigate localized dry spots. By relying on a low-cost, low-resolution
    Thermal Infrared (TIR) camera, the captured images are preprocessed and georeferenced
    before sending them to the terrestrial edge station for identifying the most effective
    irrigation pattern—allowing network, memory, and computing resources to be saved.
    We built a custom quadcopter drone for aerial remote sensing. The custom-made
    drone is equipped with a raspberry pi 4 for image capturing and processing. An
    RGB camera (pi camera) and a TIR camera (FLIR) are used to collect the RGB and
    TIR spectral images of the ground to identify the localized dry spots. We used
    the open-source software Mission planner from Ardupilot to define the flight path.
    The area of surveillance can be selected using the software (Figure 1). The image
    capturing and processing are done using python programming on the onboard aerial
    edge station. This data is further transmitted to the terrestrial edge station
    for predicting and calculating the irrigation pattern using a trained machine
    learning model. Once all the necessary inputs (GPS Coordinates, Altitude, Speed
    of Hovering) are programmed in the drone, it is ready for remote sensing. After
    taking off, the drone moves from waypoint to waypoint and captures the RGB and
    the TIR images. These combined images ( T ig ), and the flight data (GPS coordinates-
    C gps , altitude- A lt , the direction of the drone- D i ) are transmitted to
    the onboard raspberry pi through the UART communication interface. An image processing
    algorithm in python took these data and calculated each localized dry spot and
    its relative dryness. This data is further transmitted to the terrestrial edge
    station for generating the irrigation pattern through a trained machine learning
    model. After the mission is completed, the drones are returned to the land for
    recharging. The terrestrial unit consists of the terrestrial edge station and
    sprinkler control unit. The terrestrial edge unit receives the georeferenced output
    through the LoRa WAN communication. The terrestrial edge station uses a raspberry
    pi 4-8GB to calculate the sprinkler control parameters (SCP) and to generate an
    irrigation pattern which is transmitted to the smart sprinklers through the LoRa
    WAN communication. LoRa WAN technology’s long range will cover a large area of
    land without having to use a secondary signal repeater. The sprinklers will direct
    the water spray to the localized dry spots by adjusting the water pressure and
    the servo rotation head of the sprinkler head. We describe the capabilities of
    a fully-functioning, deployed system. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicle (Drone) Construction We built a custom-made quadcopter for this
    project (Figure 2a). The drone has an ultra-durable polyamide nylon based F450
    frame, Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller, and the raspberry pi 4 4GB as a flight
    computer. The F450 frame manufactured by Readytoskey (ShenZhen ReadytoSky Technology
    Co., Ltd) is made of ultra-durable polyamide nylon-parts that can withstand more
    crash-landing damages. This frame has a 450 mm motor center, ideal for using 9-
    or 10-inch propellers. This frame allows us to use BLDC motors with 16, 19, and
    25-mm mounting hole centers. The frame has a height of 450 mm with landing gears
    attached, weighing approximately 280 grams. 800 to 1100 kV motors are ideal for
    this frame. We used the 900 kV BLDC motors manufactured by Readytoskey with 10-inch
    propellers (1045 props). 30 A Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) manufactured by
    Simonk is used to control the throttle speed of the drone (Figure S1). FIGURE
    2. a) Custom-made quadcopter, b) Aerial Edge Computing System. Show All The Pixhawk
    2.4.8 flight controller controls all the motor speeds along with data sensing.
    Pixhawk 2.4.8 has a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 core processor with FPU, which has a
    rate of 168 MHz, 256 KB RAM, and 2 MB flash memory. The Pixhawk flight controller
    comes with an inbuilt accelerometer and gyroscope (MPU6050), MEMS barometer, ST
    Micro 16-bit gyroscope, ST Micro 14-bit accelerometer, and compass (magnetometer).
    Pixhawk can communicate with the peripheral device through UART, I2C, SPI, CAN,
    and USB transmission protocols. Which also supports 3.3 V to 6.6 V ADC inputs.
    The ESCs are connected to the main output channels of the Pixhawk, and the RF
    receiver is connected to the SBUS input. We construct a quadcopter drone, so we
    only need four main output channels to connect the ESCs. Channels 1 to 4 are used
    here. An external switch is connected to the Pixhawk to arm and disarm the drone.
    We used a FLYSKY FS-i6X RF transmitter and an FS- X6B receiver for transmission
    and manual control. FS-i6X is a 2.4 GHz dual antenna 6-channel RF transmitter
    based on AFHDS2A protocol, which can be upgraded to 10 channels with some DIY
    tricks. FS-i6X is compatible with PWM, PPM, i- bus, and s- bus protocols. This
    transmitter ranges from 500 to 1500 m in the air with a transmission power of
    less than 20 dBm. The 2.4 GHz dual antenna FS- X6B receiver is compatible with
    the FS- i6X and easily connected using the onboard pairing switch. The FS- X6B
    receiver supports six channels PWM, PPM, i- bus, and s- bus communication protocols.
    The receiver ranges up to 1500 m in the open field with optimum power. The RF
    receiver is connected to the SBUS input of the Pixhawk flight controller. The
    915 MHz radio telemetric module pair communicates between the terrestrial edge
    unit and the drone. This 500 mW transceiver can connect to the telemetric port
    of the Pixhawk flight controller. The other transceiver pair can be connected
    to the USB interface to receive flight data and transmit control signals through
    AT commands. The default baud rate of the full-duplex transparent serial link
    is 5600 baud. This transceiver pair ranges from 300 to 500 meters in an open field.
    The NEO- M8N external flight controller GPS module is connected to the Pixhawk
    to find the exact coordinates. This has a tracking sensitivity of 161 dBm and
    capturing sensitivity of 148 dBm with up to 10 Hz concurrent GNSS. NEO- M8N flight
    controller GPS module also includes an internal compass (magnetometer) which can
    be used to calculate the direction. There is a default port in the Pixhawk flight
    controller to connect the external GPS module, and the external compass can be
    connected to the I2C port. A 3500 mAh 3S Lithium polymer battery is used to power
    the drone and all the electronic systems. This 12.6 V battery can fly the drone
    for about 30 minutes at an altitude of 10–15 meters. A raspberry pi 4 4GB captures
    and processes the thermal, RGB images, along with the flight data from the Pixhawk
    flight controller (Figure 2b). The Broadcom BCM2711, Quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM
    v8) 64-bit SoC powers the raspberry pi 4 at a 1.5 GHz clock frequency. We used
    a 4GB RAM model for this project. That is enough to do all our necessary work.
    The camera can be connected to USB ports, and a 32 GB class 10 micro-SD card is
    used to boot the raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS. A python program captures and
    processes the images and data to generate the basic information of each dry spot
    to create the data set for the machine learning model. A 12 V to 5 V - 3.5 A external
    power converter is used to power the raspberry pi from the LiPo battery. The Pixhawk
    flight controller can communicate with raspberry pi through the UART transmission
    protocol, which is used to extract the current drone location and altitude from
    Pixhawk. Open-source Mission planner software developed by Ardupilot (https://ardupilot.org/planner/)
    is used for drone calibration and assigning flight paths. Mission planner is installed
    on a Windows computer and connects the Pixhawk utilizing a micro-USB cable. The
    quadcopter firmware with the required orientation is flashed on the Pixhawk. After
    connecting all the peripherals to the Pixhawk, the flight controller is ready
    for calibration. RF throttle, accelerometer and gyroscope, compass, and ESC must
    be calibrated using Mission planner. Flightpath, waypoints coordinates, altitude,
    and flight mode can be programmed into the drone using the graphical interface
    of Mission Planner. Once completed, the drone can communicate with Mission Planner
    through the 915 MHz telemetry module while in the air. The specifications of important
    individual components are given in the Table. S1 B. Edge Intelligence in UAV Our
    system consists of aerial and terrestrial edge intelligence units. The UAV’s edge
    intelligence acquires and processes the TIR images, primary data such as drone
    hovering altitude, GPS coordinates, hovering speed, and direction to generate
    the pixel data information, which is transmitted to the terrestrial edge for further
    machine learning approach. The drone will take TIR photos of each hexagonal sector
    after the hovering pattern, route, and heights have been put into it. Due to outside
    factors like wind and weather, the TIR camera pictures are unreliable. After being
    stabilized, the pictures are fed into the image processing phase. Prior to using
    adaptive thresholding to find the localized dry areas, the original rectangle
    TIR pictures are cropped to a regular hexagonal image and divided into R, G, and
    B components. The information from the pixel data is gathered once the localized
    dry spots are georeferenced. Pixel data are transmitted to the terrestrial edge
    station through LoRa WAN communications (Figure 3). Using a trained machine model,
    the terrestrial edge station utilizes these data to determine the irrigation pattern
    and generate the sprinkler control parameters (SCP). FIGURE 3. Acquisition, stabilization,
    and processing of TIR images in the UAV Edge intelligence to generate pixel data
    information. Show All C. UAV Imaging The custom-made drone is equipped with a
    Thermal Infrared (TIR) and a RGB camera for capturing thermal and color images
    while hovering. Thermal Infrared (TIR) Camera: A Forward-Looking Infrared Camera
    (FLIR), Lepton 3.5 FLIR was used to capture thermal images (8 - 14μm wavelength).
    The camera had a resolution of 160×120 or 80×60 active pixels and an aperture
    angle of 57° with a shutter (Figure 2a). The camera operates in the 2.8- 3.1 V
    range, with an average power consumption of 650 mW during shutter events. The
    STM32-based breakout board is used to mount the FLIR camera (Figure S2a). A micro-USB
    cable can be used to connect the FLIR camera to a computer; in our case, a raspberry
    pi (Figure 2b). RGB Camera: The raspberry pi camera captures RGB images (Figure
    S2b). The V2 camera has a Sony IMX219 CMOS 8-megapixel sensor which has a sensor
    size of 3.674×2.760 mm(1/ 4 ′′ format) with an active pixel count of 3280×2464
    (total pixels 3296×2512 ). This supports 1080p 30fps, 720p 60fps VGA90 video modes
    along with 3280×2464 pixel still images. The IMX219 has a built-in 650 nm IR filter,
    which means it is non-sensitive to IR light and draws a peak current of 300 mA
    while operating. A ribbon cable connects the camera module to the CSI port of
    raspberry pi (Figure 2b). D. Edge Intelligence at Terrestrial Edge Unit The terrestrial
    edge intelligence station receives the pixel data information of the localized
    dry spots through the LoRa WAN receptor (Figure 4). The pixel data is composed
    of each pixel’s x and y coordinate location and the distance between each pixel
    to the sprinkler ( l ). The pixel data is further introduced to a trained machine
    learning model to predict the targets such as irrigation pattern and the sprinkler
    control parameters (SCP), such as the sprinkler head rotation angle ( θ ) and
    the water flow control valve rotation angle ( ∅ ) (Figure 5). The dataset consisted
    of a training dataset making up 80% of it and a testing dataset making up 20%
    of the pixel data information. FIGURE 4. Raspberry pi 4 based portable terrestrial
    edge intelligence station. Show All FIGURE 5. Training and testing stage of the
    machine learning model to predict the irrigation pattern and sprinkler control
    parameters. Show All E. Construction of Smart Sprinkler The custom-made smart
    sprinkler consists of LoRa based IoT receiver, a servo mechanism for controlling
    the sprinkler nozzle direction, a water solenoid for controlling water quantity,
    and a ball valve rotator for controlling the pressure. An ATSAMD21 microcontroller
    controls the direction of irrigation, duration, and force of water through the
    sprinkler, as in Figure 6. The smart sprinkler is powered by a 12 V, 20 W solar
    panel (Figure 7a). The flat basement with mounting holes helps easily place smart
    sprinklers at required locations. A 0.5-inch pipe connector is used to supply
    water to the sprinkler from the pressure pump through the pipes. A 0.5-inch pipe
    connects the water solenoid output connector and the sprinkler head. This watertight
    rotating tube maintains the free rotation of the sprinkler head using the MG-90
    servomotor with gear mechanism without blockage or cracking. The sprinkler head
    can rotate from 0 to 359 degrees freely. This back-and-forth rotation of the sprinkler
    head helps irrigate in specific directions. The sprinkler head is attached to
    a water blocker controlled by an SG-90 micro servo, determining the irrigation
    distance by controlling the water pressure. A 12 V- 1 A water solenoid is used
    to turn on and off the sprinklers. The smart sprinkler detailed design and construction
    are given in the Figure S3, 4. FIGURE 6. Functional diagram of LoRa based smart
    sprinkler. Show All FIGURE 7. a) Design of LoRa WAN-based smart sprinkler for
    precision irrigation, b) LoRa enabled smart sprinkler circuit. Show All Additionally,
    the 12 V 72 PSI water solenoid helps control water flow through the sprinkler.
    A 12 V solar panel with an electronic charge controller is used to power the entire
    system. The microcontroller ATSAMD21 controls the smart sprinkler based on the
    terrestrial edge computing station commands received through the LoRa WAN module.
    These complete electronic modules are watertight and moisture-proof. The PV array
    height can be adjustable based on solar light, crop height, and shadow effect.
    The PCB design of LoRa enables smart sprinkler is given in the Figure 7b. Calculating
    the relation between the SG-90 servo angle ( ∅ ) and the irrigating distance is
    essential. We have attached a hall effect flow meter with the custom-made water
    flow control valve mechanism to develop an experimental setup (Figure 8a). This
    experimental product is connected with a pressure pump using a 0.5-inch PVC pipe.
    The hydration distance and water flow are controlled through the valve using an
    SG-90 micro servo motor and an Arduino development board (ATMEGA 328P microcontroller)
    (Figure 8b). The smart sprinkler receives the ∅ values from the terrestrial edge
    unit via LoRa WAN and the localized dry spots are irrigated selectively. We also
    developed a BLINK-based graphical interface to control the smart sprinkler parameters
    manually ( θ , ∅ , and solenoidal switching) for calibration purposes (Figure
    8c,d). CAD design of all the parts used in the smart sprinkler design is given
    in the Figure S5-20. FIGURE 8. a) Experimental setup to calculate the relation
    between ∅ and irrigation distance, b) Measuring hydration distance over each servo
    angle ( ∅ ), c) Custom-made smart sprinkler for selective irrigation, d) BLYNK
    based application to calibrate sprinkler control parameters. Show All F. RF Communications
    LoRa WAN is used as the transceiver for drones and smart sprinklers. It is essential
    to point out that, for a large region of farmland, the terrestrial edge station
    must be able to connect with most of the smart sprinklers without needing a secondary
    repeater. During system operation, less than 30 kB of data is transmitted from
    the drone to the terrestrial edge computing station and to the sprinkler. Therefore,
    using LoRa WAN technology for data transmission is feasible because bandwidth
    is not a key concern in the system. For a communication system, optimal range,
    power, and price/performance trade-offs are possible by using LoRa technology.
    The spread spectrum modulation method used by LoRa is unique and was developed
    from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology [51], [52]. The LoRa WAN (Long Range
    Wide Area Network) serves primarily as a network layer protocol for controlling
    communication across Low Power Wide Area Network (LP WAN) gateways and edge devices
    as a routing protocol [51]. According to the regulations, LPWAN technologies mainly
    operate in the ISM band from 902 MHz to 928 MHz in the USA and the band from 863
    MHz to 870 MHz in Europe [53], [54]. Using a LoRa gateway, the appropriate edge
    station can transmit information to the LoRa WAN with a bandwidth of 125 kHz.
    Multiple data rate options, ranging from 250 bps to 5470 bps, are supported by
    this technology. A transmission range of up to 10 km helps to make up for this
    extremely low data rate [51]. It’s vital to note that a high-gain antenna and
    an environment lack of physical obstructions are requirements for reaching such
    long distances. A 20% packet loss rate for a distance of around 2 km between nodes
    and the LoRa gateway has been demonstrated in studies employing an SX1278 LoRa
    chip and an ultra-low power STM32L151 microcontroller [55]. For our purpose, we
    chose a RYLR896 LoRa module (Integration of SX1276 LoRa communicator and STM 32
    microcontroller), which has a more extended range and better receiver sensitivity
    (down up to −148 dBm). The LoRa chip uses a peak power of 300 mW when in transmission
    mode and drops to 60 mW when in reception mode. These values decrease to a power
    level close to 0.25 mW in sleep mode. The peak power needed only lasts for a time
    frame of less than 10 ms when operating in the mode with the lowest transmission
    rate [51]. The FSK, GFSK, MSK, GMSK, LoRa, and OOK modulations are supported by
    the SX1276 LoRa modem, which has a configurable bit rate of up to 300 kbps. G.
    Terrestrial Edge Front End The user control GUI (Graphical User Interface) available
    at the terrestrial edge is the terrestrial edge console (Figure 9). Tkinter is
    used to create the unit. Tkinter, sometimes known as ”Tk interface,” is a python
    module that allows access to the Tk GUI toolkit. This toolkit was created in TCL
    (Tool Command Language), and it is multiplatform, supporting Linux, MAC OS, and
    Microsoft Windows. The only framework included in the python standard library
    is Tkinter. The terrestrial edge console collects data from the smart sprinklers
    (Figure S21a) and aerial edge through LoRa WAN communication and external REST
    APIs are utilized to get weather data (Figure S21b). These APIs employ GPS coordinates
    to acquire correct weather for terrestrial edge control station. The sprinklers
    can also be manually controlled by the user for calibration purpose by changing
    the θ and ∅ values of each sprinkler (Figure S21c). The terrestrial edge GUI is
    also used to visualize the irrigation pattern of each smart sprinklers. If there
    are unfavorable weather conditions, the weather data collected can show how well
    the sprinkler system performs. FIGURE 9. Terrestrial edge front end for data representation
    and real time visualization of irrigation pattern. Show All H. Methodology Surveying
    the farm area is the first step to collecting each boundary point coordinates,
    total farm area, and shape. Consider a square-shaped farmland; the four boundary
    coordinates are the primary data needed for further calculations. The total surveillance
    area is divided into hexagonal sectors where the smart sprinklers are placed at
    the center of each sector. A python program is developed in processing, which
    takes the areal map of farmland, boundary conditions (coordinates), diagonal of
    each hexagon, and hexagon separation x and y values to avoid overlapping as the
    input. The farm map is overlaid with a regular hexagon grid based on these data.
    The program also provides the coordinates of the center of each hexagon. Finding
    the exact locations for sprinklers are achieved through this method. The method
    used for implementing hexagonal griding is shown in the algorithm S1. We implemented
    the project on a 40 m x 40 m open grassland. The land is virtually divided into
    a few small segments. A hexagonal sector with a diagonal dimension of 10 m is
    used in this project. TIR images acquired by the drone are processed using the
    onboard edge intelligence module along with the flight data in order to estimate
    the location and dryness of every localized dry spot within each hexagonal sector.
    This data is transferred to the terrestrial edge station through LoRa WAN communication.
    The terrestrial edge station (raspberry pi 4-8GB) collects these data and generates
    a dataset containing the rotation angles ( θ,∅ ) of the water flow control valve
    and the nozzle head. To precisely calculate the irrigation pattern, the ML model
    incorporates environmental parameters such as field soil moisture absorption rate,
    crop type, dry spot area, and weather. 1) Image Stabilization The major problem
    we faced during the reconstruction of the thermal images was the stability of
    the recorded thermal videos. This is mainly affected by the steadiness of the
    drone subject to environmental conditions like wind and weather. Before determining
    the properties of the localized dry spots, it is essential to stabilize the thermal
    videos. A python code written for Open CV took the shaky video. It converted that
    to a stabilized video based on changing the frame transformation parameters from
    one frame to another using optical flow for all frames. The frame transformations
    are a rigid Euclidean transform consisting of three parameters distance ( dx,dy
    ) and angle ( dθ ). The algorithm in python compiles the transformations to obtain
    the ”trajectory” for x,y , and the angle at each frame. New transformation= transformation
    +(smoothed trajectory−trajectory) (1) View Source A sliding average window is
    used to smooth the trajectory. The radius of the window defines the number of
    frames used for smoothing. The new transformation is formatted using equation
    (1) and applied to the entire thermal video. The final output of the stabilized
    thermal video is created by cropping the unwanted edges of all frames. The algorithm
    for stabilizing the drone video is detailed in Section S2. 2) RGB Splitting of
    Thermal Video The color of the localized dry spots varies from dark blue to red
    hue when the dryness increases. The environmental conditions such as weather and
    atmospheric temperature can also affect the quality of captured TIR images [18],
    [56]. Removing unwanted information from the TIR images is an essential preprocessing
    step in the aerial edge unit. Separating a picture into its RGB component channels
    reveals that the R channel contains the bulk of the image’s informational value,
    making it simple for an image processing system to identify the video’s reference
    plane and pinpoint the location of any dry areas. A 40 x 40 cm2 aluminum sheet
    attached to a wooden frame was used as the temperature reference plane. The algorithm
    S3 is used to split the TIR images into R, G, B channels. 3) Localized Dry Spot
    Detection From TIR Images The area of a single dry spot ( A ) is calculated based
    on the TIR image covering a single hexagon. This is calculated according to the
    resolution of the TIR imaging camera and the drone’s altitude. For an altitude
    of 4 m, the dry spot area of 2.5 cm2 equals 1 pixel of the TIR images captured
    using a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. Since we are using the same TIR camera for the
    experiment (Lepton 3.5 FLIR), the resolution is constant. This calculation depends
    upon the drone’s altitude at which the image is captured. The OpenCV library transforms
    the thermal image input into a greyscale image. The image is represented as I(x,y)
    , with (x,y) denoting the pixel coordinates. The image height (h) and width (w)
    are calculated to represent the image as a (h x w) pixel metric. The pixel metrics
    is evaluated horizontally { y 0 x 1 , y 0 x 2 ,….., y 0 x (w−1) , y 0 x (w) }
    and the vertical value ranges as { y 0 , y 1 ,….., y (h−1) , y h } . Threshold
    value T is predefined, i.e., determined from trials exhibiting maximum dry spot
    detection DMAX and minimum error EMIN from multiple image evaluations. The pixel
    values I ( x,y ) exceeding the threshold are considered dry spots, hence highlighted
    in the image with greyscale value 0 representing C. The image area is also estimated
    in pixels; in the bulk image process, the image name and area are represented
    in an excel worksheet. The processed images are stored in an output directory
    for further processing. The algorithm S4 is used to find the localized dry spots
    area. The input image is a greyscale image with dry spots represented with RGB
    {0, 0, 0}. There are two predefined values, i.e., alpha and pixel ratio. α represents
    the error or deviation from the expected target dry spot of the water jet. The
    area covered by deviation or error is defined as A ′ . The total area covered
    is A MAX will be higher than the actual area ( A ) Total area covered  A MAX =A+a
    A ′ (2) View Source α value depends on the pressure deviation, nozzle size of
    the sprinkler, wind, and external factors. The sprinkler precision is considered
    as 100% when α=0 . The α value is empirically determined and used to correct the
    sprinkler rotation angles to avoid deviation from the actual area ( A ) that needs
    to be covered. The corrections can be manually set by the terrestrial edge front
    end. Variation of α corresponds to the pixel_ratio , which is a cluster of pixels
    around the dry spot, clubbed together as a single region to be irrigated, referred
    to as sprinkle_area if the pixel ratio value in the area is. sprinkle_area= (pixel_ratio)
    2 (3) View Source The sprinkle_area values can range from 1 to n2, depending on
    pixel_ratio . The value of the sprinkle ratio is significant concerning the sprinkler
    nozzle type or spread rate. The algorithm uses a decision tree classifier to obtain
    the rotation angles, flow rate, pressure, and distance for every dry spot coordinate
    value ( x,y ). Algorithm 1 details the irrigation of localized dry spots. Algorithm

    Hexagonal Sector To visualize the complete image processing process in the aerial
    edge computing system, the GPS coordinates of each localized dry spot location
    is calculated from the TIR image of a hexagonal sector. The algorithm uses the
    RGB split TIR images along with the GPS coordinates of the smart sprinkler as
    input and crops an image to a regular hexagon, placing the sprinkler at the center
    of the hexagon. The corresponding image is converted to.png format to adjust the
    transparency value ( α ). The slope of the hexagonal sides is computed, and all
    the pixels beyond the hexagonal boundaries are set to have a value of 0. The center
    point of each localized dry spot is determined, and the GPS coordinates are calculated
    according to the algorithm given in Section S 5. I. Irrigation Pattern Generation:
    Machine Learning Aided Model for Generating Irrigation Pattern of the Smart Sprinkler
    Target Prediction Based on Machine Learning The pattern of irrigation is generated
    as an array of [ θ n , Φ n ] values, θ and ∅ are sprinkler head rotation angle
    and the pressure valve control servo angles. Various machine learning models were
    used to predict the target variables [ θ n , Φ n ] using the data gathered from
    thermal images and sprinkler experiment data (Figure 10). The ML dataset includes
    the pixel data information, drone parameters, and environmental data. The aerial
    edge computing system generates the pixel data from the processed TIR images,
    including the position of each pixel ( x,y ) and the distance between each pixel
    and the sprinkler ( l ). A training dataset comprised 80% of the dataset, and
    a testing dataset comprised 20% of the dataset. By contrasting anticipated and
    actual values, the accuracy of the ML regression models was examined. By creating
    python scripts that accessed the Orange API, the Orange toolbox was used to execute
    ML studies. Python script widgets are used in Orange to execute python scripts
    to carry out extra functionalities like feature significance. The outputs of the
    python script widget are the updated variables from the python script. FIGURE

    contains the Python codes developed for all modules of this work. (https://github.com/skmidhun09/drone_aided_smart_irrigation)
    SECTION III. Results A. Hexagonal Grid Mapping The aerial edge computing station
    distinguishes each localized dry spot from the TIR images. Our preliminary experiment
    was to map a survey area and calculate the exact number of sprinklers required
    for the land and its GPS location. We chose an open grassland of 40 m x 40 m dimension
    as our survey area. The four boundary coordinates were obtained from Google Maps.
    The drone waypoints were set to hover over the grassland at about 20 m altitude
    while capturing RGB and TIR images. The sector is divided into smaller hexagonal
    sectors with a 10 m radius and the location of each sprinkler is determined using
    the algorithm S1 (Figure S22,23). The drone hovering pattern is further generated
    from the sprinkler location of the farmland. The location of each smart sprinkler
    is given as a waypoint in the Ardupilot Mission planner software which calculates
    an appropriate drone hovering pattern. B. Video Stabilization Environmental factors
    such as weather and wind can arbitrarily change drone stability, which will also
    affect the stability of the thermal images and video captures. Although gimbal-based
    image stabilization methods are efficient, on the other hand, it is also expensive.
    To mitigate the negative impacts of camera, shake on recorded video and enhance
    the overall quality of the media, we developed a video stabilization program.
    The frame transformation parameters of the TIR video are adjusted relative to
    the Euclidian distance of frame transformation. Figure 11 a represents the fluctuation
    of d x and d y for a shaky video. There was no camera rotation during recording,
    therefore angle deviation ( d a ) is ignored. Figure 11b,c represents the change
    in pixel value for the x and y trajectory for an un-stabilized and stabilized
    video. The new transformation of each frame is calculated from the previous transformation
    by applying the smooth trajectory parameters d x and d x (Figure 11d). FIGURE

    of un-stabilized and stabilized video. c) y trajectory transformation of un-stabilized
    and stabilized video. d) Stabilized frame to frame transformation. Show All C.
    RGB Splitting of TIR Images We discovered that abrupt changes in the environmental
    conditions impact the effectiveness of dry spot recognition when isolating the
    localized dry patches from the TIR videos. This is calculated by comparing the
    TIR images to the contrast value of the reference plane (a 40 cm2 aluminum foil
    attached to a wooden piece used as reference in this case). The low-resolution
    Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera cannot effectively distinguish the reference plane from
    the surrounding wet areas. Splitting each color channel (R, G, B) of TIR images
    effectively determines the relation of the reference plane and dry patch color
    in the TIR images. The blue and green channels cannot distinguish the reference
    plane from the wet areas (Figure S24a,b). In contrast, a dry region is best defined
    in the red channel (Figure S24c). This feature can be utilized to precisely calculate
    the localized dry spots by comparing the temperature of the reference plane on
    the ground. D. Optimum Drone Hovering Altitude to Determine the Localized Dry
    Spots Effectively To find the optimum altitude for a drone hovering in the smart
    irrigation, we conducted experiments using synthetic turf placed inside a single
    hexagonal sector. An artificial turf of 5 m2 is placed at the center of one sector.
    TIR images of the turf is captured using a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera at different
    altitudes from 4 to 20 m (Figure 12a) while hydrating the turf using a known quantity
    of water (0.5 to 2.5 L) as in Figure 12b. The area of each wet patch is mapped
    into pixels through the blob detection method. The TIR images are used to estimate
    the influence of image resolution of the Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera at various altitudes.
    The pixel representation of wet patches for each hydration level at different
    altitudes are calculated. The relation between the wet patch area and hydration
    level at different altitudes (Figure 13a), TIR image representation of the wet
    patch for each altitude at different hydration levels (Figure 13b). This data
    is used to map the relationship between the dry spot area, moisture level, and
    the TIR image capturing altitude for a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. FIGURE 12. a) TIR
    images captured using Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera at 12 m altitude for different hydration
    levels, b) TIR images captured using Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera for a hydration level
    of 2.5 L at different altitudes. Show All FIGURE 13. a) TIR image representation

    each altitude at different hydration levels for a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. Show
    All We created two adjacent wet patches of 1 ft radius separated 1 ft apart by
    hydrating the turf with a known quantity of water. This is to determine the resolution
    of the corresponding FLIR camera and the optimum altitude to capture the TIR images.
    Each wet patch is hydrated with 1.5 L and 2.5 L of water, and the TIR images are
    captured at different altitudes (4 m- 20 m) as in Figure 14a. We find that the
    FLIR camera can clearly distinguish each wet patch up to an altitude of 12 m (Figure
    14b,c). A larger coverage area was achieved at higher altitudes of the drone hovering,
    giving a shorter period to cover the farmland. We further used image processing
    to accomplish pixel mapping of the corresponding wet patches (Figure 14d). At
    a height of 12 meters, the FLIR camera could capture approximately 40 x 30 m2
    in a single image. Therefore, the hexagonal diagonal dimension can be increased
    to 15 meters, thereby reducing the initial hovering time and cost. FIGURE 14.

    learning model is developed to determine the sprinkler flow rate corresponding
    to each pixel distance from the center of each segment. At the optimum altitude
    for drone hovering (12 m), the total area of a single pixel is about 7.5 cm2.
    Depending on the location of the dry zone pixels, the ML model generates an accurate
    servo angle for nozzle head rotation ( θ ) and flow rate control ( ∅ ) along with
    the working duration of water solenoid to precisely irrigate each pixel in the
    TIR image. E. LoRa Communication The SX1276 LoRa module is used to transmit data
    from the aerial edge to the terrestrial edge and from the terrestrial edge to
    the smart sprinklers. The SX1276 LoRa module is set as a transmitter or receiver
    based on the purpose. The spreading factor (SF) and the bandwidth (BW) determine
    LoRa communication’s efficiency and the maximum transmission distance, which is
    governed by the RSSI and SNR parameters. We studied the influence of these parameters
    on the SX1276 LoRa module by changing the spreading factor from 7- 12 for each
    bandwidth value of 125 kHz and 250 kHz. The experiment was conducted with three
    LoRa modules, one of which transmitted data to the other two. One of the LoRa
    modules is equipped with a 2.1 dBi helical antenna, and the other with an 8d Bi
    fiberglass antenna. The receivers are taken to different parts of our campus to
    measure the RSSI and SNR values. While experimenting, we achieved the highest
    transmission distance of 778 m for the LoRa module with the 8d Bi fiberglass antenna
    and 503 m for the LoRa with a 2.1 dBi helical antenna. RSSI and SNR values for
    every distance are recorded for 125 kHz and 250 kHz bandwidth (Figure S25-28)
    in order to figure out the optimum LoRa configuration. We see that larger SF values
    and smaller BW values result in a greater transmission distance. Figure 15a,b
    indicates the RSSI and SNR values for each transmission distance for the configuration
    of SF 12 with 125 kHz and 250 kHz bandwidth. The highest transmission distance
    is achieved with minimum package loss when the LoRa is configured with a SF of
    12 and a BW of 125 kHz which is used in this system. A LoRa configuration with
    a bandwidth of less than 125 kHz can increase transmission distance, but at the
    expense of an increase in transmission delay. FIGURE 15. a) RSSI values of LoRa
    module for each transmission distance using a 8.1 dBm fiberglass antenna, b) SNR
    values of LoRa module for each transmission distance using a 8.1 dBm fiberglass
    antenna. Show All F. Georeferencing of Localized Dry Spots The smart sprinkler
    is located at the center of the hexagonal sector, and its GPS coordinates can
    be read out from the Pixhawk using UART communication. The drone’s hovering altitude
    is fixed so that one side of the TIR image is the same as the diagonal of the
    hexagon’s adjacent sides. The TIR images are divided into hexagonal-shaped sectors
    and each localized dry spot is georeferenced based on the GPS coordinates and
    altitude of flight (Figure 16). A dataset is generated with the pixel data information
    of each dry spot. The ML model uses this dataset to calculate the irrigation pattern
    by generating the smart sprinkler control parameters ( θ,∅ ). FIGURE 16. Localized
    wet and dry spots area and location calculation through python programming from
    the red and blue channels respectively. Show All The machine learning model is
    trained with a dataset that relates water flow rate and the irrigating distance.
    The water flow rate is determined by rotating a ball valve using an SG-90 micro
    servo motor controlled by the ATSAMD21 microcontroller (Figure 17a, b). We experimentally
    determined the servo angle’s irrigation distance and flow rate. The ball valve
    and servo motor are attached so that the 0° angle closes the valve and 90° opens
    the valve completely. The flow rate vs irrigating distance of the smart pump in
    a 10° interval is shown in Figure 17a, b. FIGURE 17. a) Relationship between servo
    angle and a) irrigation distance and b) flow rate of the Smart sprinkler. Show
    All G. Deviation in Irrigation Pattern For Localized Dry Spots Even if the image
    processing algorithm calculates the localized dry spots exactly, the smart sprinkler
    may not irrigate the targeted region precisely based on the irrigation pattern
    generated by the machine learning model. This may be the result of a number of
    external or internal factors that influence the precision of the irrigation pattern.
    External factors such as wind or internal issues such as the inconsistency of
    the sprinkler nozzle can lead to this inaccuracy. From our studies, a single pixel
    of a TIR image captured by a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera from an altitude of 4 m represents
    2.5 cm2 (Figure 18a). The smart sprinkler is designed to irrigate based on the
    temperature of each pixel, which means the irrigation pattern is directly related
    to each pixel mapping. For a smart sprinkler to precisely irrigate a dry spot
    of 2.5 cm2 the nozzle diameter of the sprinkler should be so small that it is
    challenging to construct because of the pressure generated inside the sprinkler
    when the water solenoid turns on. We have introduced a sprinkler error constant
    (α) to represent the deviation in the irrigated area from the irrigated pattern.
    The α value varies from 0 to 1. An increase in the α value increases the hydration
    area (Figure 18b-d), which reduces the system efficiency. The value of α should
    be zero for a perfect smart irrigation system. Figure 18e represents the relation
    between the α value and the area deviation. The figure shows that the relation
    between α and deviation area is linear for TIR images captured up to an altitude
    of 12 m using a Lepton 3.5 FLIR camera. This will help to improve the system efficiency
    by including the change in α value parameter in the ML dataset, which will not
    be applicable for images captured above 12 m altitude. However, the difference
    in area calculated using pictures taken at higher altitudes (>12m) showed erroneous
    results. This is due to the resolution limit of the TIR camera used. Hence, we
    maintained the image capturing altitude of 12 m for all our experiments in this
    study. FIGURE 18. a) TIR images of localized dry spots captured using a Lepton
    3.5 FLIR camera at 4 m altitude, b) Smart sprinkler irrigation model for error
    value ( α)=0 , c) Smart sprinkler irrigation model for α=0.5 , d) Smart sprinkler
    irrigation model for α=1 , e) Irrigation area deviation with varying α values
    at different capture heights. Show All H. Machine Learning Aided Model for Generating
    Irrigation Pattern of the Smart Sprinkler 1) Prediction Efficiency of the Decision-Making
    Model At the terrestrial edge, a machine learning model will generate the SCP
    based on the TIR image data and the input dataset (Figure S29). The performance
    of the ML models was evaluated using the four key parameters: Mean Square Error
    (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared
    (R2). The MAE evaluates the average size of errors over a set of predictions without
    considering their direction. It evaluates the accuracy of continuous variables.
    MSE’s penalty is proportional to the square of the error rather than the actual
    error. A smooth gradient for minor errors is created when the error is squared,
    which gives the outliers more weight. An effective model should have MSE values
    that are almost zero. The square root of MSE is used to calculate RMSE. The range
    of MAE, MSE, and RMSE is from 0 to ∞ . R-squared is also estimated to show how
    well a regression model fits the data. The best R-squared value is 1. The four
    machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
    Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network, are tested for performance based on the
    MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2. The RF model, which we evaluated, had the highest accuracy
    in predicting the θ and ∅ , with an MSE value of 0.063 (Figure S30). The KNN shows
    the second-highest accuracy with an MSE value of 0.149. SVM had the lowest accuracy
    with an MSE value of 86.581. The highest effective model (Random Forest) was introduced
    into the terrestrial edge unit for the prediction of SCP (Figure S31). 2) Estimating
    Feature Importance For Maximum Relevance and Minimal Redundancy A selection of
    predictors with a high prevalence is identified. Unnecessary predictors reduce
    model performance and raise computing costs. Some of the predictors among them
    have a considerable impact on how the model responds. The significance of each
    feature was examined by varying the predictors and calculating the accuracy drop.
    We wanted to identify the predictor combination relevant to the response, including
    predictors produced from TIR image processing and meteorological data output.
    The performance of a model is reduced by unnecessary features, which also raises
    the cost of computation. It’s crucial to identify a subgroup of features with
    a high prevalence. Some factors have a greater influence on the response model
    than others. Using the RReliefF algorithm and the k-nearest neighbor approach,
    we prioritized the significance of features or predictors. RReliefF is a continuous
    target function that rewards features that provide different values to neighbors
    with different response values while penalizing features that provide different
    values to neighbors with the same response values. To choose only the variables
    that maximize the information gain, we analyzed the RReliefF for each variable.
    Figure 19 displays the RReliefF-implemented features relevance rating. The features
    are marked as CL, L = [1], [2], [3], [4], where C1 is the distance between each
    pixel to the sprinkler, C2and C3 are pixel x,y coordinates values and C4 is the
    angle between pixels and the sprinkler reference axis. C1 was discovered to be
    the most crucial characteristic among the CL predictors with a weight of 0.595,
    where C2, C3, and C4 shows almost equal importance with RReliefF value of 0.388,
    0.390, and 0.373. While comparing features, the RReliefF score serves as a baseline;
    certain features can be eliminated depending on feature importance values. FIGURE
    19. Identifying a subset having high prevalence features with ranking the significance
    of the predictors using the RReliefF method. Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion We
    have developed a drone aided thermal mapping system to control the smart irrigation
    system to irrigate crops with an optimum quantity of water for precision agriculture.
    The aerial edge computing station captures the TIR images and determines the localized
    dry spot when the drone hovers over each hexagonal sector. The dry spot information
    is transferred to the terrestrial edge control station through LoRa WAN communication.
    The LoRa WAN-based smart sprinkler operates in accordance with the terrestrial
    edge computing station’s determination of the dry spot based on the ML-produced
    irrigation pattern. This smart irrigation system can precisely hydrate all the
    crops in the implemented region based on the reference hydration level, soil moisture
    absorption, and weather condition. This system applies to any crops in and geological
    location. And the system is scalable regardless of the size, geological background
    of the agricultural land, and variety of crops cultivated. Authors Figures References

  description: Farmers in developing nations are faced with limited technology for
    smart and economical ways of irrigation. This is worsened by the high cost of
    imports since most of these nations are import-dependent. Increasing agricultural
    yield to meet the growing population in most of these nations has led their governments
    to pursue cost-effective ways of managing water and other resources required for
    optimum agricultural yield. In this study, the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge

    technology for smart and economical ways of irrigation. This is worsened by the
    high cost of imports since most of these nations are import-dependent. Increasing
    agricultural yield to meet the growing population in most of these nations has
    led their governments to pursue cost-effective ways of managing water and other
    resources required for optimum agricultural yield. In this study, the Internet

    Nigeria Introduction According to the National Agricultural Agency of Nigeria,
    about 80% of the nation''s population is dependent on agriculture or agricultural-related
    product(s) as primary or secondary means of living income [1]. Water shortage
    is one of the world''s most pressing issues today [2], and crop cultivation, being
    a labor-intensive activity, is dependent on the supply of water for its growth
    and productivity [3]. As a result, an intelligent system that utilizes an efficient
    automated water supply is required for the optimization of crop water supply.
    Smart irrigation systems evaluate and measure the depletion of crop growth moisture
    to optimize the irrigation process [4]. Consequently, there''s a need for fully
    autonomous, intuitive, and smart agricultural watering systems is becoming extremely
    unavoidable with the rapid exponential population growth, in Nigeria [5], [6].
    For this purpose, an Internet of Things (IoT) IoT based smart water management
    system has been developed to address the challenge with systematic irrigation
    of cultivated crops. The research underscores a critical issue highlighted by
    the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO): currently, 60% of
    water diverted or pumped for irrigation is lost through runoff or evapotranspiration
    [7]. Addressing this challenge necessitates the development of intelligent irrigation
    systems, demanding a level of efficiency achievable only through robust data analysis
    and effective implementation strategies. This article advocates for the adoption
    of an IoT based irrigation systems, emphasizing their reliance on data-driven
    automated signals [8], [9]. A. Problem Statement Addressing the imperative of
    meeting and potentially enhancing agricultural output demands, a reliable and
    timely provision of irrigation/fertigation is essential [4], [5]. However, the
    existing technologies of cloud computing prove theoretically insufficient for
    the extensive application of IoT in large-scale scenarios [9]. The proliferation
    of reports obtained by IoT sensing devices poses a significant challenge, surpassing
    the current capacity of data centers in terms of processing and storage capabilities
    [2]. Efficient water consumption, timely irrigation, and conservation of limited
    water reservoirs represent the primary objectives of a rapid and intelligent irrigation
    system for cultivating fields. Despite numerous sensor-based smart irrigation
    systems developed over time, concerns persist regarding their reliability, particularly
    as data volume grows and the latency rate of IoT devices becomes a pertinent issue
    [10], [11]. This research aims to delve into these challenges, offering insights
    for the advancement of dependable and high-performance smart irrigation solutions.
    With the emergence of intelligent irrigation distribution network, there is the
    potential to reform agricultural practices by utilizing advanced methods to optimize
    crop yields as well as water use [4]. However, there are still significant challenges
    that need to be addressed to fully realize the benefits of smart irrigation systems
    [12], [13]. One of the key issues is the lack of standardization in the technologies
    used, leading to inconsistencies in performance across different systems [12].
    Additionally, there is a need for more accurate and reliable methods for measuring
    soil moisture levels, which is critical for determining the appropriate amount
    of water to be applied. Furthermore, the integration of weather forecasting data
    and other environmental factors is essential for ensuring efficient water usage
    and minimizing waste [14]. Therefore, the research problem that needs to be addressed
    is how to develop a standardized and reliable smart irrigation system that can
    accurately measure soil moisture levels, integrate weather forecasting data, and
    optimize water usage for different types of crops in different environments [13],
    [15], [16]. Within this study, an intelligent IoT-based irrigation mechanism was
    developed using an Edge computing architecture, the output thus is a predictive
    machine learning (K - Mean Clustering) algorithm intended for accurate soil moisture
    prediction for smart/intelligent agriculture. SECTION II. Literature Review Within
    the field of IoT architecture, [9] introduced a comprehensive framework encompassing
    cloud-based storage, data processing, and analysis derived from ubiquitous sensors.
    Additionally, it incorporates a decision support interface for enhanced functionality.
    Building upon this foundation, [17] proposed an IoT middleware platform reference
    model, specifically designed to bolster intelligent IoT applications. The manifold
    benefits of IoT -based solutions in various agricultural domains have been extensively
    validated [18]. This study posits that the integration of intelligent solutions
    within the context of smart irrigation holds promising potential, particularly
    in optimizing water usage for enhanced agricultural efficiency. The basic criteria
    for developing a smart irrigation system are soil moisture, precipitation, as
    well as evaporation [19], [20]. Soil moisture is influenced by two primary factors
    which are precipitation and evaporation [21]. In geography and climatology, the
    proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation to evaporation which is employed
    to determine quantity of moisture available to the crop in the soil [22], [23].
    [24], [25] states that the ratio of daily precipitation to daily evaporation may
    also be used to assess daily/average soil moisture. [26], [27] proposes that weather
    station reports should be based on direct access to precipitation measurements,
    but evaporation may be determined using different methods [28], [29]. E T ∝( E
    p + E m ) (1) View Source Where; E T = Evapotranspiration E m = Soil moisture
    E p = = Precipitation Studies were carried out in Florida by [30], which concluded
    that Evapotranspiration (ET) based watering schedule controllers are more cost-effective
    in terms of irrigation costs, size, and personnel requirements. ET -based irrigation
    systems utilize a lot less water than planned procedures. A fuzzy logic-based
    decision support system was proposed by [31] based on farmers'' understanding
    of crop status and their experience as farmers. In contrast to single-threshold
    and multi-threshold dependent irrigation scheduling methods, the findings of [32]
    affirm that the proposed system achieves superior water conservation. Addressing
    the imperative of water conservation in irrigation practices, [33] presented an
    automated system that used a General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) module and a
    wireless sensor network. The system incorporates real-time monitoring facilitated
    by a network of soil moisture sensors and controllers strategically deployed across
    the crop field. This research contributes valuable insights into efficient water
    management in agriculture, advocating for the adoption of advanced irrigation
    systems for sustainable resource utilization. In 2021, [32] developed an irrigation
    sensor with user accessibility to the sensors via a smartphone application APP.
    The digital camera on a smartphone is used to convert Red Green Blue (RGB) to
    gray to calculate the proportion of moist to dry soil in order to quantify soil
    moisture. Through a gateway, the wetness-to-dryness ratio is sent to the water
    motor controller. To hibernate and calibrate the sensor, a mobile application
    (APP) was built for this research. Using a machine learning system and extensive
    knowledge of agronomists, [34] presented irrigation solutions such as Gradient
    Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), that predicted irrigation plans and recommendations
    with an accuracy of 93%, and were deemed the most superior regression model. The
    created model aids in the irrigation management of the agronomist. The research
    presented by [35] introduces an advanced intelligent irrigation monitoring system
    that utilizes thermal imaging technology. This innovative methodology involves
    deploying a drone equipped with a thermal imaging camera. Through the application
    of sophisticated image processing techniques, the study formulates an algorithm
    capable of discerning crucial parameters such as water requirements, leaf water
    potential, and identifying instances of nonuniform irrigation. This cutting-edge
    approach holds significant promise for precise and effective irrigation monitoring,
    contributing to the evolution of intelligent agricultural practices. SECTION III.
    Methodology A. Theoretical Framework As shown in Figure 1, data was gathered via
    the sensors. Using the same medium, data on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
    were gathered during this stage. A microprocessor, actuators, and all sensors
    are present in the perception layer. One of the final three layers is the rest.
    A schedule for watering crops, instructions on how to manage them, and other details
    are provided by the transport and processing layers. The next element after acquiring
    the data is to store it in data centers for analysis. Figure 1 depicts the theoretical
    framework of the proposed architecture below. Figure 1: Framework for IoT -Aided
    Intelligent Irrigation System Using Edge Computing Show All B. Research Methodology
    The developed IoT architecture features four layers instead of the standard IoT
    design''s three layers, including an application layer, a processing layer, a
    transport layer, and a perception layer (application layer, network layer, and
    perception layer). Since sensors are present in the perception layer, which is
    also referred to as the physical layer, data collection is possible. From the
    air, it detects humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. Through networks like
    Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, and LAN, the transport layer serves as the conduit for transporting
    sensed data that was previously gathered to the processing layer. Massive volumes
    of data from the transport layer are stored, examined, and processed in the processing
    layer. To develop an intelligent irrigation system for efficient water management,
    it is essential to rapidly predict soil moisture content. Evapotranspiration is
    an essential element in soil moisture content prediction [19]. In 1985, Hargreaves
    and Samani devised a method grounded in temperature and extraterrestrial radiation
    to ascertain E T 0 . Figure 2: Schematic diagram of irrigation sequencing algorithm
    Show All It is expressed as T max = T min τ max + T min 2 E T 0 =0.0023 R a [

    Where; E T 0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Γem p max and Temp min =

    T max and T min = maximum & minimum temperature °C) R s = Solar Radiation (MJ
    m −2 da y −1 ). α 1 A proposed IoT -based architecture (refer to Fig. 1) serves
    to systematically gather and proficiently manage the physical attributes of agricultural
    land for the enhanced operation of an irrigation system. These attributes, encompassing
    soil moisture, soil temperature, radiation, air temperature, and air relative
    humidity are transmitted and subj ected to a comprehensive processing methodology.
    This approach integrates both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques,
    as depicted in the block diagram (Fig. 2), employing K-means clustering and Support
    Vector Regression (SVR) to discern variations in soil moisture attributed to weather
    conditions. The predictive accuracy of soil moisture levels is gauged by a lower
    Mean Squared Error (MSE), affirming the reliability of the methodology. C. System
    Framework Figure 1 illustrates architectural framework of the proposed IoT-based
    intelligent irrigation system. Among its seven fundamental components is a field
    data gathering apparatus featuring a relay switch in both Distinct and Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) scenarios. The system incorporates web services for tasks
    such as capturing field sensor data, accessing online weather forecasts, managing
    water motors, predicting soil moisture levels, implementing versatile web-based
    interfaces for monitoring in real time, and integrating IoT-enabled motor pumps.
    These components are systematically organized into three tiers, contributing to
    the system''s comprehensive functionality and efficiency. D. Field Data Collection
    Device In accordance with field requirements, an autonomous sensor node or a wireless
    sensor network composed of such nodes was strategically deployed. The data collection
    device utilized several sensors, comprising the VH -400 soil moisture sensor,
    the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, the soil temperature sensor, and the
    UV light radiation sensor based on the GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op-Amp. The integration
    of a Raspberry Pi with an Arduino-Uno facilitated the retrieval of data from these
    sensors. A Python software application on the Raspberry Pi systematically collects
    sensor data at hourly intervals, storing it in an SQLite database. This database
    is seamlessly synchronized with the server database through a well-established
    web service protocol, ensuring efficient and consistent data management. The program
    code was written in Python language to design a web service that retrieves hourly
    sensor data stored on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Aurora database synced with
    the EC2 container. E. Online Assistance for Collecting Data from Field Sensors
    The implemented online assistance, developed in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP),
    employs a streamlined REST API to facilitate smooth data transmission between
    the server and the field device. Hosted on Apache, the web service operates on
    the server machine. The Raspberry Pi leverages this web service to effectively
    transmit field data to the server. Significantly, the web service incorporates
    indicator settings at the database level, ensuring resilience to network fluctuations
    or outages during the synchronization process of data sent to the server from
    the field device. This strategic design enhances the robustness and reliability
    of the data transfer mechanism. F. Online Weather Data Collection Web Service
    For the acquisition of weather forecasting data, a sophisticated Python web service
    has been developed. This web service not only collates a comprehensive set of
    various meteorological characteristics, such as humidity and temperature, cloudiness,
    UV Index, and precipitation but also extracts this information from various web
    forecasting portals such as Open Weather and AccuWeather via their respective
    APIs (API Reference, 2017; Weather API, 2012). The predicted data, which is usually
    offered in HTML, XML, or JSON formats, is then processed and stored in the server''s
    MySQL database using the web service''s API. This meticulously crafted infrastructure
    ensures the availability of accurate and timely projected data, which forms a
    crucial input for the prediction algorithm. Additionally, a REST API is employed
    for seamless data communication between the server and the field device, enhancing
    the overall efficiency of the system. G. Algorithm for Predicting Soil Moisture
    Employing a support vector regression model in conjunction with the k-means clustering
    technique, the study devised a sophisticated algorithm (refer to Fig. 2) to predict
    soil moisture levels, utilizing data from field sensors and weather forecasts.
    The algorithm not only presents real-time details on the moisture content of the
    soil for the days ahead ebut also provides intelligent recommendations for irrigation
    practices, optimizing water and energy usage based on predefined soil moisture
    thresholds and anticipated precipitation. The substantive findings of this algorithm,
    along with the corresponding device-generated data, are systematically stored
    in the MySQL Database on the server. A comprehensive discussion of the algorithm
    is presented in detail, elucidated in Fig. 1 for enhanced clarity. H. Real-Time
    Monitoring via a Responsive Web Interface To facilitate real-time monitoring and
    optimize irrigation scheduling, a dynamic web-based user interface has been meticulously
    crafted using PHP, MySQL, and the Bootstrap API. This interface seamlessly presents
    real-time sensor data, forecasts of soil moisture for the upcoming days, and precipitation
    data Notably, it incorporates an intelligent irrigation scheduling feature, grounded
    in a predefined threshold value of soil moisture. In response to the anticipated
    soil moisture pattern and precipitation data, the system dynamically regulates
    the irrigation schedule to maintain the specified threshold. The automation feature
    ensures that the irrigation system commences automatically and halts when the
    soil moisture attains the predetermined threshold value, enhancing the efficiency
    and precision of irrigation practices. Figure 3: Soil Moisture Comparison Chart
    Show All I. Web Service for Controlling Irrigation To start and stop the water
    motor, a web service built on top of the HTTP protocol has been designed. The
    water motor is started and stopped using R-Pi Python code that accesses this web
    service. When the R - Pi is running Python code, it sends a signal to the Arduino-Uno,
    which manages the relay switch to turn on and off the water motor. J. Water Distribution
    With the Internet of Things Capabilities Incorporating a water pump within this
    module, a relay switch interfaces with a Wi-Fi-enabled node for seamless control.
    The web service orchestrates the node''s actions triggered by the adaptable web-based
    interface, which makes real-time observation possible. The web-based interface,
    in turn, empowers remote management of the water pump, offering both manual and
    automatic control modes for enhanced operational flexibility and efficiency real-time
    monitoring. SECTION IV. Results and Discussions The developed intelligent irrigation
    prediction system for the greenhouse was deployed using a genuine capacity for
    making decisions with machine learning capabilities. The methodology of this documentation
    describes the system''s conception and execution. To evaluate the performance
    of the developed system, the sensors were placed in a greenhouse, including light,
    soil moisture, and temperature and humidity sensors. The prediction accuracy of
    the soil moisture content determines how intelligent the developed solution can
    project futuristic irrigational requirements of the soil. The developed system
    predicted against actual soil moisture content data is represented in Table II.
    To evaluate the accuracy of the soil moisture prediction system, hourly field
    data on air temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV
    are collected for three weeks. The hourly data from the three weeks have been
    averaged out each day, and the data from the 21 days were divided into two sets:
    a training set including 70% of the data and a testing set comprising 30% of the
    data, in order to test the proposed approach Using the suggested approach, an
    estimated Soil moisture Deficit (SMD) for the next days (Fig. 3), and the expected
    values of SMD were utilized to forecast soil moisture for the following days.
    The outcomes are listed in Table 1. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology
    hinges on the precision of the forecasted soil moisture values, as illustrated
    in Tables 4 and 5. A rigorous assessment for collecting hourly field data covering
    air temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, oil temperature, and UV over a three-week
    period is done to determine the accuracy of the soil moisture prediction system.
    This dataset is subsequently averaged on a daily basis, and the 21 days'' data
    is partitioned into a training set (70% of the data) and a testing set (30% of
    the data) for algorithm application. Employing the proposed algorithm, Soil Moisture
    Deficit (SMD) for the upcoming days is initially predicted (refer to Fig. 3).
    Subsequently, these predicted SMD values are utilized in forecasting soil moisture
    levels for the same timeframe. A comprehensive summary of the outcomes is presented
    in Table 1, providing insights into the algorithm''s performance and its reliability
    in predicting soil moisture dynamics. Table I. Correlation between the proposed
    algorithm and soil moisture values based on sensor data in terms of correlation,
    r-squared, and mse Table II. Sensor data and the results of the developed algorithm-based
    for soil moisture Table II, as depicted in Fig. 3, serves as a visual representation
    underscoring the significance of the two developed algorithmic predictions - namely,
    the forecasted soil moisture using the Soil Moisture Deficit (SMD) by Support
    Vector Regression (SVR) and the predicted soil moisture employing the SMD algorithm,
    i.e., (SVR + k-means). In the computation of SMD, the (SVR + k-means) methodology
    demonstrates superior accuracy and a reduced mean squared error compared to the
    SVR approach alone. Employing the recommended algorithm (SVR + k-means), the projected
    SMD yields results in closer alignment with the actual SMD, surpassing the accuracy
    achieved by SVR in isolation. Furthermore, in the estimation of soil moisture,
    the (SVR + k-means) strategy attains comparable accuracy and a diminished mean
    squared error relative to the SVR approach. The synergistic interplay between
    actual soil moisture content and predicted values is comprehensively presented
    in Table II and visually depicted in Fig. 3, offering a nuanced understanding
    of the algorithmic performance. SECTION V. Conclusion Soil moisture is an important
    factor to take into account when designing a smart irrigation system. Soil moisture
    is influenced by a number of meteorological variables, including air temperature,
    air humidity, UV radiation, soil temperature, etc. Technology breakthroughs have
    resulted in significantly more precise weather forecasts and the ability to forecast
    changes in soil moisture using the expected data. Thanks to technological developments,
    weather forecasts are now considerably more precise, and variations in soil moisture
    may now be predicted using the expected data. The system uses an IoT -based smart
    irrigation architecture implementing a predictive and smart irrigation system
    for a greenhouse. The system based on historical data predicts the required soil
    moisture for an adequate crop growth rate. In terms of accuracy and error rate,
    the predicted value for soil moisture is better. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors state

  description: With the improvement of Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing,
    the smart agricultural system is driven by data produced by the different sensors
    and smart computing devices in the agricultural land. A new methodological paradigm
    high-performance edge computing is incorporated with blockchain implemented precision
    agriculture system to improve the data processing operation related with resource
    management. Edge computing nodes collect and analyze the sensor data locally without
    transforming to the remote centralized cloud server, which rises data processing
    speed and reduce the network latency. The blockchain technology is incorporated
    with machine learning algorithm to maintain secured and protected distributed

    of IoT, Blockchain & Geospatial Technologies Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction Unlike
    conventional distributed datastore, blockchain technology provides advanced cryptographic
    techniques and emerging tools to store and access smart agricultural data that
    are shared with several untrusted users. Blockchain technology solves a number
    of data integrity issues caused by following untrusted operations: 1. single point
    failure in a supply chain centralized database, 2. lack of data integrity due
    to the regular use of smart agricultural management, 3. hackers can access and
    modify sensitive data, and 4. third-party assistance for providing security. The
    blockchain technology is applied on smart agriculture system to achieve ecosystem
    of agricultural services. Blockchain-based precision agricultural system provides
    secured environment for storing, exchanging, and retrieving confidential data
    between the several farmers and other persons. The integration of smart accuracy
    agriculture, edge computing, IoT, and blockchain technology allows the agricultural
    environment system to reduce the wastage of natural resources and increase the
    profit. With the new development of edge computing and blockchain technology,
    a precision agricultural system produces more profit by increasing crop and food
    productivity and reducing usage of natural resources. In the agricultural land,
    several sensors and devices are used to capture the environmental data and land-related
    data and these data are transferred to the data server in the cloud environment.
    Edge computing plays an important role to reduce the workload of cloud data server
    and minimize the volume of data moved to the data server. Instead of transferring
    data to the cloud data server, edge computing nodes perform the operation locally
    which is closer to the IoT devices in agricultural environment. The edge computing
    node provides necessary information to the farmers, agriculture officers, agents,
    researchers, and producers to earn more profit. The farmers can receive required
    information at the correct time to take better decision. The sensor data are collected,
    processed, and analyzed locally closer to the data center without transforming
    data to the remote centralized cloud server so that network transport latency
    is reduced. In Fig. 1, we have explained the precision farming system constructed
    on blockchain and edge IoT-based computing technology. IoT devices such as cameras,
    environmental sensors collect large amount of data from the farm and transmitted
    to cloud storage system for data analysis. The process of transferring data from
    IoT application area to the cloud service will take more time and reduce the speed
    of the system. The edge computing service is introduced between the IoT application
    system and cloud system to reduce the network traffic and latency in cloud environment.
    The edge computing server increases the speed of the data analysis process and
    provides solution to the farmer and the other users immediately without delay.
    The edge computing paradigm allows sensor data to be stored and analyzed close
    to the data source and application devices using 5G network connection, which
    reduce the cost and increase the crop yield. Fig. 1 A precision agriculture system
    using blockchain technology Full size image The proposed work is explained in
    this paper which is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the related work
    in a precision smart efficient agricultural system using blockchain technology
    and an edge computing. The IoT, edge computing, and blockchain functionalities
    of the various layers are discussed in Sect. 3. The process flow of the projected
    system is explained. In Sect. 5, we have explained the experimental environment
    and parameters, results, and analyses of various algorithm. In Sect. 6, we have
    explained the result of the proposed efficient precision agricultural system and
    future enhancements. 2 Related Works In 2050, the world population is expected
    to reach 9.6 billion. To provide the food products to the large population, agriculture
    department should integrate with new technology [2, 5, 13]. Precision agriculture
    is a sensor-controlled and software-managed environment for automatic collection
    of land environmental data, data analysis, monitoring, and tracking of operations
    with advanced technologies to meet the food products’ demands in future. Precision
    agriculture uses IoT and blockchain technology to avoid centralized management
    of data [17]. Traditional centralized smart agriculture system has lack of data
    security, data misinterpretation, and data redundancy [1, 3]. Blockchain-based
    smart agriculture system provides efficient services to the different stockholders
    like farmers, farm product wholesalers, supply chain agents, and financial sectors
    participated in every process from farm to our plate [4, 6, 7]. Blockchain is
    a chain of secured and verified block of information with timestamp. Blockchain
    and smart contract already proved information transparency and security-based
    record keeping [8, 9]. It provides trusted way of storing and processing of data
    in a distributed environment. Blockchain information are immutable which avoids
    alteration of data in the blockchain. Distributed consensus algorithm is implemented
    using tamperproof method to support users to validate every transaction in the
    blockchain network [10, 12]. It ensures no false information is added in the blockchain
    hashed data with the support of timestamp and cryptographic footprint data. IoT
    devices are responsible for monitoring and collecting land environment data with
    minimum power and low cost and lack of information security. This security and
    traceability problem can be solved by smart contract and blockchain mechanism
    [11, 14]. Figure 2 shows the different components of three-layered precision agricultural
    system. Edge computing is a distributed environment, which moves storage and computing
    power nearer to the IoT wireless sensor network to reduce the workload of the
    cloud server and the latency [15, 19]. Edge computing node provides immediate
    response to the farmers to take better and efficient decision to improve the crop
    yield and reduce the usage of resources. It reduces the cost and increases the
    network efficiency by providing better security [16, 18]. Analysis of sensor data
    performed in the edge computing node reduces the network latency and increases
    reliability, modularity, and scalability. Raspberry Pi acts as an edge computing
    node, which executes a machine learning algorithm to predict the required information
    about the crop yield and status of resources using gateways [18]. Fig. 2 Precision
    agricultural system Full size image 3 IoT, Edge Computing, and Blockchain Technology
    in Precision Agricultural System Smart contract controls do not allow the third-party
    intermediate users to fix the price for food products in the market. The blockchain
    technology controls the usage and modification of data in the edge server and
    cloud server node using contracts and consensus algorithm. Food supply fully depends
    on the agricultural process, which is composed of pre-harvesting and post-harvesting.
    Pre-harvesting includes finding best quality seed, cultivation process, market
    demand, finding soil quality, and need of fertilizer. Post-harvesting represents
    distribution of food products in the market to the producer, supplier, and consumer.
    Food supply management involves direct and indirect users to accomplish the transfer
    of food products to consumer or producer through different agents. Blockchain
    allows different levels of users to access the centralized secured data and execute
    different operations on hashed data. 3.1 Proposed Blockchain-Based Agricultural
    Model The proposed system allows the users to trace the food product data from
    land to consumer and ensures the security and adoptability. In Fig. 3, we have
    explained the different use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture system.
    The blockchain technology helps to create trustworthy environment between the
    producer and consumers in food supply chain management. Every transaction is stored
    as block in chain with time stamp, which cannot be modified in future. Sensors
    collects crop data and environment data from the agricultural and stored in edge
    computing node for data pre-processing. Some portion of the data is processed
    in the IOT side edge process node to provide information to the different users
    and farmers and other users immediately without any time delay. Machine learning
    algorithm is executed in the edge layer processing node to predict the crop yield
    and demand in the market. Fig. 3 Use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture
    Full size image 3.2 Functionality of Layered Architecture Blockchain-based precision
    agricultural system consists of different kind of components at each layer to
    perform agricultural land sensor data analysis, which are collected from agricultural
    land. In Fig. 4, we have explained different components and layers of the proposed
    system. The different functionalities of various layers are explained below: Data
    collection layer: It is responsible for collecting land- and crop-related data
    from different sensors and drones deployed in the agricultural area. The collected
    data is transferred to the highest level edge computing server node using wireless
    sensor network gateway. Edge computing layer: The edge computing layer comprises
    storage server and processing node, which is responsible for processing the data
    nearer to the data source to reduce the latency and network traffic. It provides
    required information to the user with minimum response time. Bigdata analytics
    layer: Data mining association rule algorithm is executed on the large volume
    of data to generate the pattern to be stored in the knowledge repository with
    contract-based blockchain technology. It can be used by the farmer and other stakeholders
    hashed in the blockchain. Blockchain service layer: Transaction details and data
    from each layer are stored in the blockchain in a distributed environment to support
    the property traceability for all users and security. Application layer: The user
    can access information or knowledge pattern from the knowledge repository using
    laptop, computer, or mobile phones at any time and everywhere. The farmer, retailer,
    agri-officer, supplier, and retailer can access information using mobile devices
    connected via Internet. Fig. 4 Layered architecture using blockchain technology
    Full size image 4 Performance Analysis The proposed blockchain system maintains
    transaction transparency using decentralized ledger when compared with traditional
    approach. The performance of the proposed secured blockchain system is measured
    in terms of speed, average latency, average throughput, resource utilization,
    and user performance. The experiment is performed on 250 transactions in two different
    blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Ethereum is a distributed
    computing platform with smart contracts, open source, and public. Hyperledger
    Fabric is an open-source permissioned private blockchain technology with distributed
    ledger. Figure 5 shows the comparison of average throughput for Ethereum and Hyperledger
    with varying number of transactions. The experiment was conducted with two platforms
    on five different sizes of datasets. For all datasets, Hyperledger has more throughput
    than Ethereum. The next performance matrix latency is evaluated with different
    number of transactions for Ethereum and Hyperledger. In Fig. 6, we observed that
    the throughput increases when the number of transaction increases. The Ethereum
    has more latency than Hyperledger. Fig. 5 Comparison of throughput Full size image
    Fig. 6 Comparison of latency Full size image 5 Conclusion and Future Work With
    the development of edge computing efficient technologies and blockchain algorithm
    rapidly transfer traditional smart agricultural systems to advanced precision
    agricultural systems. The effective food supply chain system is developed with
    use of consensus algorithm in two different blockchain platforms. In this paper,
    we proposed secured advanced smart precision agricultural system deployed in the
    field of research and food supply, which provides transparency and security to
    the information stored in the knowledge repository. The farm management process
    is optimized with the use of machine learning algorithm and security contacts
    by improvising the food plant and crop yield and minimizing the convention of
    natural resources. The proposed system delivers the needed information or knowledge
    to the farmers at the correct time and correct place. The novelty of the proposed
    advanced system is to maximize the profit for the farmers and minimize the investment
    cost based on blockchain-based food supply system. In future, the proposed method
    can be extended for designing food chain management system in order to increase
    the profit for farmers and crop demand and disease analysis. References Antonucci

    text. Full Text Preview Introduction Agriculture Agriculture is one of the oldest
    economic sectors for thousands of years ago (Mazoyer & Roudart, 2006). The farming
    began manually with the help of a few animals & with a few manual devices. Agriculture
    is an important sector, of the overall economy anywhere (Alston & Pardey, 2014).
    The various factor dependable on each other for overall growth. Agriculture has
    a wide range of subsections such as farming, food industries, animal centers,
    food trails & errors, services sector, agricultural research, and many more. Agriculture
    can cover different types of farming as Subsistence, Intensive Subsistence, Mediterranean,
    Arable, Shifting Cultivation, etc (Komarek, De Pinto, & Smith, 2020). Today, there
    is an increment in the human population that needs more agricultural production
    with concern to a varied range of food products. There is a large volume of farmers
    associated with middle or low income of agriculture which is accounting for national
    income. To maintain the routine of the Environment cycle agriculture is helpful
    in many nodes as reduces erosion & soil moisture, Soil carbon sequestration (Palm
    et al., 2014). Another side some pesticides used in farming create environmental
    pollution to a certain extent (Tudi et al., 2021). There can be various impacts
    on CO2 by renewable energy consumption (Waheed et al., 2018). Agriculture affects
    directly and indirectly many other industries for prospects. Agriculture methods
    have been changing dynamically. The conventional way of agriculture production
    involved the preparation of soil, sowing of seeds, Adding Fertilizers, Irrigation,
    weed protection, Harvesting, Storage, and distribution as described in Figure
    1. Each phase is modernized as time passes. The new technology assists profoundly
    in enhancing the performance of Agribusiness. Figure 1. Elementary Agriculture
    Intelligent Agriculture Agriculture with AI-aided machinery is becoming popular
    as intelligent Agriculture using IOT support. Intelligent agriculture utilizes
    various types of robots as intelligent machines for different task execution.
    Automation surely benefited in almost all fields but in agriculture, it is a big
    revolution as it is the prime source of income for a large volume of people. The
    smart devices enabled AI support pushes agriculture towards intelligent agriculture
    with human intervention. The traditional agricultural tasks such as harvesting,
    weed identification, and pest examination are also done with autonomous robots
    which are AI aided. The usage of intelligent machines in agriculture will enhance
    the speed of work compared to human laborers (Ahmad & Nabi, 2021). There is a
    higher number of technical integrations with agriculture by various smart devices
    & mechanisms for sensing, identification, transmission, monitoring, analysis,
    and prediction. Such IoT devices will save time & cost & improves crop yields
    (Chen & Yang, 2019). The remote sensors, GIS, GPS, drones, and many others are
    actively playing an important role in Intelligent Agriculture. Agriculture Challenges
    In Front Of Technology Many factors affect traditional farming as rainfall, temperature,
    and humidity. An imbalance in climatic changes may cause deforestation and pollution
    which create a hurdle for farmers to take decisions to prepare the soil, sow seeds,
    and harvest (Harris et al., 2001). The nutrient deficit can result in poor crop
    quality as every crop requires a certain type of soil nourishment (Nair, 2019).
    Weed protection is also crucial to increasing the production of nutrients (Ibáñez
    & Blázquez, 2019). Agriculture is not an isolated sector; it is an integral part
    of a sound ecosystem. There are many challenges in agriculture as horticulture,
    animal centers, dairy, and other allied sectors (McCalla & Economics, 2001). Technology
    is widely integrated into multiple stages of the agriculture process. The internal
    & external resources can be utilized with a better prospect using current trends
    of technologies. The broadly technological challenges can be classified as Continue

  description: Today farmers around the world are gradually embracing Smart farming
    assisted by different cutting-edge technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is playing a major role in the development of smart agriculture applications.
    Artificial intelligence, edge computing, cloud computing, big data, etc are other

    Today farmers around the world are gradually embracing Smart farming assisted
    by different cutting-edge technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing
    a major role in the development of smart agriculture applications. Artificial
    intelligence, edge computing, cloud computing, big data, etc are other forefront
    technologies used in smart agriculture. Stages of Agriculture activities for a
    certain crop can be broadly classified into three categories, viz, pre-harvest,
    during harvest and post-harvest phases. In each phase, many activities have to
    be performed. Pre-harvesting stage involves seed selection, land preparation,
    crop selection, etc., during harvesting includes irrigation, disease analysis,
    pathogens detection, etc. and Post harvesting involves storage, cooling, reaping,
    etc. In the current work, we have carried out a thorough literature review of
    these activities involving smart farming one by one. We have attempted to find
    the flaws in terms of IoT devices, security, dataset, and methodologies used in
    these existing works. Based on the research gaps a 5G-based smart farming framework
    has been proposed. We have also presented a brief comparative analysis between
    our survey and the existing surveys. Our survey has been found to be more comprehensive
    compared to the existing ones in many regards. Previous article in issue Next

    harvestingNB-IoTSDN 1. Introduction One of the most important pillars of human
    society is agriculture. According to the food and agriculture organization (FAO),
    to cater the needs of growing population, food (FAO, 2009) production need to
    be increased by 70–65 % in 2050. Farmers must put in more effort while using the
    traditional agricultural approach, which also uses resources inefficiently. Several
    issues, including population expansion, climatic circumstances, a shortage of
    resources, etc., occur from this ancient farming approach. The term smart agriculture
    refers to digital farming practices that are used to maximize effectiveness instead
    (Javaid et al., 2022) of capability. This system performs structured and optimal
    input and output analytics through smart technologies, objective-focused analysis,
    planning, and monitoring. As a result of collecting and pooling analytical data
    using advanced sensor, a methodology group is built that is optimized for achieving
    this objective-oriented analysis. For monitoring and managing agricultural operations,
    this cutting-edge technology combines Internet of Things (IoT) networks, devices,
    AI, and big data analytics. Through the use of diverse electronic, biochemical,
    and electrical sensors and actuators, various farming field data can be collected,
    and through this data, different sub-operations of farming applications can be
    developed. Using IoT to monitor crops (Sreekantha and Kavya A.M., 2017), detect
    diseases and pests, predict crop yields, robotics-based harvesting of crops, and
    much more. The creation of a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be accomplished
    using various types of wireless connections, each with a range, bandwidth, and
    topology that varies. A novel kind of wireless network can be built using topologies
    like bus, star, and mesh and a variety of communication technologies including
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, LTE-M, thread, Sigfox, etc. to communicate data from one node
    to another about the farming field. The edge gateway layer where all sensor node
    data are stored and processed for further analysis is connected to this sensor
    network. The data can be communicated to a different distributed network over
    the internet to a cloud server for additional analysis and monitoring at the user
    end by using application protocols like “Hypertext transfer protocol” (HTTP),
    “Message queuing telemetry transport protocol” (MQTT), etc. The gateway can be
    utilized as single-board microcontrollers and computers similar the Raspberry
    Pi (Charania and Li, 2020). Digital transformation is the main advancement in
    agricultural development which (Baryshnikova et al., 2022) transforms 1.0 into
    5.0 in the twenty-first century. The key to advancing digital transformation in
    smart agriculture from version 5.0 to version 6.0 is the development of wireless
    communication technology. A number of wireless communication technologies, including
    “Long Range Radio (LoRa)”, Radio frequency module (RFM69)“, ”Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)“,
    and ”SigFox“ etc (Hidayat et al., 2020) have been utilised in agriculture. It
    is possible to create a secure smart farm system, also known as a 5G beyond Smart
    agriculture system (Tomaszewski et al., 2022) by fusing several technologies including
    IoT, Edge computing, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain
    (Andreadis et al., 2022, Kasera et al., 2022). The ability to manage and achieves
    a variety of computing workloads and necessities for storage can be encouraged
    by developing a hybrid or dispersed sensor network employing cloud computing and
    edge computing. In this regard, edge computing will be able to regulate jobs that
    demand speed or limitations on connectivity. In addition, cloud computing will
    be able to accommodate operations that demand higher processing capabilities,
    for instance, machine learning (MCLRN), as well as managing enormous volumes of
    data by utilizing load-balancing techniques. From this type of technologies farmers
    will be able to access farming field status remotely and the system will be entirely
    automated through interoperability between machines (Li et al., 2021). Considering
    the research strategy that was used to write this review article is discussed

    Fig. 1 denotes the simplified structure of how the review article is organized.
    Based on pre-, during-, and post-harvesting operations, the various IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture literature has been identified and categorized. After classifying
    and reading the literature, each pre-harvesting, during-harvesting, and post-harvesting
    operations’ existing subsystems have been thoroughly discussed and its weaknesses
    analyzed. This analysis has been accomplished based on the IoT-enabled technologies,
    data set gathering, and approaches that have been used in the past and it also
    includes an overall thorough assessment of the pre-, during-, and post-harvesting
    subsystem''s research gaps. Based on this research gap a modified 5G IoT-based
    smart agriculture framework has been proposed to reduce the shortcomings of the
    existing work. The Pre-harvest to post-harvest activities have been categorized
    in this article to explain the existing work for the smart farming system. The
    classification of pre- to post-harvest activities is presented in the Fig. 2.

    2. Pre-harvesting system (PHRS) Throughout the pre-harvest process, there are
    a number of land preparation (LPR) sub-activities that considerably increase agricultural
    yield. Researchers, scientists, and engineers have made a number of advancements
    in the past to create a smart PHRS using smart agriculture technology (Gaikwad
    et al., 2021), that can choose the crop in advance depending on climate conditions,
    region, area, etc. and prepare the land for production. The sub-areas of PHRS
    that are used when preparing the land for farming are depicted in Fig. 3. Download

    PHRS subsystem classification. 2.1. Crop yield prediction (CYP) IoT-based method
    for yield prediction in which sensor node data is shared with data centers (Gayatri
    et al., 2015) and made available to the sons of the soil. To anticipate agricultural
    yield, supervised MCLRN is carried out utilizing (Kumar et al., 2020) the “Random
    Forest” (RADF) and “Decision tree” (DT) algorithm. In this situation the RADF''s
    accuracy is superior compared to the DT''s. A two-tier MCLRN model called the
    “adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN)” and the “Extreme Learning
    Machine algorithm (ELM)” were proposed to predict crop yield. By applying ELM
    to (Gupta and Nahar, 2023) increase performance accuracy, the suggested system
    optimize the weights using a modified version of the Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm
    (mBOA). The creation of an algorithm for predicting crop yield (Bhojani and Bhatt,
    2020) three new activation functions called “DharaSig,” “DharaSigm,” and “SHBSig”
    are employed to enhance the neural network''s performance on agricultural datasets.
    K Closest neighbor procedure is employed to identify the crop that is most acceptable
    (Gajula et al., 2021). For the purpose of forecasting the yield of the sorghum
    crop, (Jayaram and Marad, 2012) a fuzzy inference approach is implemented. A fuzzy
    model''s input tools are physio-morphological features. Due to estimates and ambiguity,
    the model''s performance depends on quantum data. A method for managing massive
    data and predicting crop productivity three different types of (Fan et al., 2015)
    approaches have been employed that is MapReduce weather data for computing large
    datasets; nearest neighbor weather data for comparing distances across like years;
    and, finally, an “Autoregressive moving average” (ARMA) model for forecasting.
    To determine crop yield, a “Support vector machine” (SVM) and DT approach are
    used. While choosing (Reshma et al., 2020) features for a specific location, factors
    like soil type, temperature, humidity, groundwater level, local population, farmers''
    availability, variety of plantations, and variety of farmed land were taken into
    account. Analysis has been conducted based on these traits to determine the optimal
    crop. A mixed MCLRN approach was put forth to estimate agricultural yield. The
    most precise (Anbananthen et al., 2021) MCLRN prediction from two models is combined
    using the stacking generalization model. Cross-validation is used to evaluate
    a hybrid MCLRN model''s performance to that of other MCLRN models for evaluation.
    For the purpose of predicting agricultural yield (Sajja et al., 2021) an MCLRN
    simulation is designed, where crop segments are built up experimentally for the
    training of models using SVM, random forest, and ID3. In which case SVM outperforms
    other methods. The key advantage of the current CYP is that most systems classify
    soil nutrients and geographic data for crop yield prediction using data mining
    techniques like KNN, ID3 and fuzzy inference systems, which produce superior prediction
    outcomes. The geographic information was gathered using a GPS approach that is
    IoT-enabled. The RGB-D camera is utilized as a mobile platform to enhance the
    CYP. Crop quality, data-driven decision-making, cost reduction, and resource optimization
    are all improved by using IoT-enabled data mining approaches. The shortcomings
    of the existing techniques are as follows: prediction based on time series analysis,
    area-wise analysis, soil quality analysis, country-wise analysis, and geospatial
    analysis remain to be explored. There is no hybrid MCLRN algorithm for handling
    huge datasets. Full IoT based system still need to be worked upon. 2.2. Crop selection
    (CSL) Enhancing Agricultural Sustainability through Crowdsensing (Ginige and Sivagnanasundaram,
    2019) a mobile-based agricultural information-sharing system is developed for
    monitoring real-time farming activities (CSL LPR, “seed selection”, “seed sowing”,
    “irrigation, “crop growth”, “fertilizing”, and “harvesting”) with the help of
    a crop calendar marker. IoT-based system for crop selection and monitoring precision
    farming (Bhojwani et al., 2020) various sensors are employed to measure environmental
    variables and interface with the microprocessor. An IoT gateway using ESP8266
    sends the data acquired to a cloud server. On the basis of data collected earlier
    from the cloud server, the existing working model uses K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    to estimate prospective predictions to be able to make precise decisions about
    what crops to grow in a particular environment. Maximize the crop yield (Kumar
    et al., 2015) for selecting which crops to cultivate over a season the MCLRN method
    predict yield rates based on environmental variables including weather, soil type,
    water density, and crop type. Smart agriculture-based crop selection analysis
    utilising (Tseng et al., 2019) big data a platform is created to track environmental
    elements on a farm and use those environmental factors to evaluate farmers'' agricultural
    practices. The findings suggest that farmers can determine a crop''s suitability
    for their land with greater insight. This is so they can take a look at things
    like soil moisture levels and temperature. The suggested environmental factor
    analysis methodology aids farmers in learning which crops they can produce. In
    order to optimize food production (Udutalapally et al., 2021) an innovative agricultural
    solution is proposed that uses AI and IoT for selecting crops, disease monitoring,
    and automated irrigation systems. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA technology on (Balezentiene
    et al., 2013) language and numerical reasoning is provided as a fuzzy-based system
    for crop selection in Lithuanian climatic conditions. “Johnson''s reduct” classifier
    method is used (Deepa and Ganesan, 2019) to produce classification rules for three
    crops, including rice, “groundnut”, and “sugarcane”, in a decision-based system
    for crop selection. According to present environmental (Bakthavatchalam et al.,
    2022) circumstances a system has been established for precision agriculture that
    uses IoT and classifier-based MCLRN algorithms to recommend the crop for irrigation
    and acquire the highest yield. AI for characterization and forecasting the (Amkor
    and El Barbri, 2023) results of potato samples cultivated with “Nitrogen”, “Phosphorus”,
    “Potassium” (NPK) fertilizers has been suggested in which KNNs are used for classification
    and nonlinear autoregressive models for prediction. Machine learning and artificial
    intelligence advancements for the existing CSL system improve the decision-making
    for planting crops according to climate conditions and location. By using IoT-enabled
    solar power-based crop recommendation systems, energy consumption is reduced.
    Genetic optimization is the most common method for optimizing CSL performance.
    Crop guidance is improved when weather conditions are forecasted through the development
    of a crop calendar-based system. Some of the shortcomings may be as follows: the
    current CSL solution lacks self-sustainability, testing for additional crops,
    security of sensor node data, system optimization, and subsystem integration.
    2.3. Seed selection (SSL) A tillage drip architecture is used for recommending
    seeds for (Indira et al., 2018) planting. Additionally, it discusses how effective
    seed selection based on soil can produce precise results. Seed selection is possible
    in the first phase, automatic watering is covered in the second phase, and plant
    disease diagnosis is covered in the third phase. A computer vision to identify
    (Koklu and Ozkan, 2020) different dry bean seed kinds the user interface was created
    using MATLAB, and 13,611 grains of seven different types of dry beans were photographed.
    The model has undergone 20-fold cross-validation and has been constructed using
    a variety of MCLRN classification methods, including MLP, SVM, KNN, and DT. When
    compared to other classification model results, SVM performance performed better.
    Deep-learning methods for seed classification were proposed in which fourteen
    (Hamid et al., 2022) different types of seeds were gathered and pre-trained using
    “MobileNetV2″ to create a model. The trained model claimed accuracy of 98 % on
    the training set and 95 % on the test set after rigorous experiments, extensive
    pre-processing, and fine-tuning. The advantage of the current SSL system is that
    it chooses the appropriate seeds for individual fields using a computer vision-based
    method based on MCLRN and AI. Water, insecticides, and fertilisers may all be
    used more efficiently by farmers. This has good effects on the environment in
    addition to lowering costs. The existing work lacks a fully automated system and
    limited use of data. Need more research for various types of seed classification
    based on climate condition, geographical region wise, and land wise. 2.4. Seed
    germination (SGM) Proposed and created a smart germination assistance (SGA) system
    for SGM. “Temperature”, “humidity”, “light intensity”, “moisture”, and soil “pH”
    are all factors that (Islam et al., 2019) affect SGM. Using particular sensors,
    the system continuously measures the values of various factors in the surrounding
    environment. Each sensor reading from a different seed is kept and connected to
    an ideal value. Using a low-power embedded system (Shadrin et al., 2019) an AI
    method is proposed that can recognise SGM dynamics without necessitating heavy
    data transfer between nearby nodes. 97 % accuracy is attained with a “convolutional
    neural networks” (CNNs) model for seed recognition. A system based on the IoT
    was proposed to monitor, manage, and (Theparod and Harnsoongnoen, 2022) collect
    data regarding the effects of narrow-band light emitting diodes (LEDs) on sunflower
    nodes. With the help of “narrow-band LEDs” and dynamic germination, it was found
    through research that the germination of sunflower seeds was more successful in
    the red-light zones. IoT-based study is carried out for indoor tomato SGM (Seyar
    and Ahamed, 2023) systems at thresholds. Where transplanted seedlings were grown
    outdoors with a comparison of two irrigation systems using soil water balance
    methods with a long-range LoRa communication system, and the subsurface drip irrigation
    system produced the highest seedling levels of growth based on agronomical parameters
    at a 12 % threshold. A feature of the current SGM system is the usage of a LoRa-based
    data communication system for various modules during the SGM process, such as
    irrigation and seed growing status. For the dynamic seed germination process,
    the usage of IoT-based “narrow-band LEDs” produces better results. The system
    in place uses only one type of seed for testing, and it is not entirely IoT-based.
    As a result, there is a lack of a fully validated testbed system that uses an
    ideal sensor, is self-sustaining, and can be utilised for other crops. The current
    system still has flaws as it does not deal with plant biomass growth, flowering,
    fruits, and other types of crops utilising IoT-based technique and image processing
    algorithm. 2.5. Drought or flood monitoring (DFM) A “WPART” IoT-enabled smart
    farming system is established that uses MCLRN (Rezk et al., 2021) to anticipate
    crop productivity and drought for informed decision-making. The following data
    factors are used to pick features: year, month, rainfall, temperature, air pressure,
    season, crop, “area”, “production”, and productivity. An IoT-based tackle has
    been put up for agricultural drought (Ping, 2014) data transmission and accumulating.
    The outcome shows that the system''s data capture and transmission performance
    is flawless, and it has good application value for gathering and analysing agricultural
    drought data. An MCLRN/IoT-based flood tracking system is portrayed (Rani et al.,
    2020) to gauge the water level in a flood-prone site. The intensity of floods
    is gauged using raindrop and water sensors. An IoT-based dam water monitoring
    alerting system is developed (Ganesh et al., 2022) for calculating how much rain
    fell, one may determine how much water will be released from the dam. The signal
    is analysed and judgements are made using the Arduino UNO. IoT data collection
    in real-time and MCLRN analysis and drought result prediction are two benefits
    of the current DFM. For obtaining and analysing data on agricultural drought,
    the gearbox performance is faultless, and it has strong application value. Absence
    of a long-term analysis based on previously established value and absence of coverage
    based on humidity and rainfall across a vast area were observed. There is lack
    of long-distance data connection methods in remote fields. The absence of dark
    shadow detection in the current technology makes it difficult to detect noisy
    pixels values in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for flooded regions, which can
    lead to erroneous data. 2.6. Soil testing and measurement (STM) The optical transducer
    is used as a detecting sensor. This sensor (Goswami et al., 2020) comprises of
    three LEDs as a light source and an as “Light detector” (LDR) for assessing the
    results of soil tests performed on four distinct types of soils. Each nutrient''s
    threshold values divide its level into three voltage levels: Low, Mid, and High.
    A technique for monitoring soil health utilising four dynamic parameters was developed.
    In which the (Ramson et al., 2021) effectiveness of a network made up of nine
    soil health monitoring units was tested over the course of several weeks in an
    agricultural field site. Soil sensing, wireless range, power consumption, life
    expectancy, and implementation cost were all evaluated. An IoT-powered soil health
    tracking (Sengupta et al., 2021) approach that can manage agricultural parameters
    has been created. The variations in stimuli, including those related to light,
    heat, sound, motion, magnetic fields, etc., are converted into electrical signals
    by a sensor node and then processed and graphically displayed by the Thingspeak
    cloud server. Using cellphones or personal computers, a methodology is proposed
    for sensing (Saikia and Khatoon, 2022) the percentage of wetness of the soil and
    temperature remotely and continuously. Raspberry Pi-based soil nutrient monitoring
    system for tomato plantations is proposed using various soil sensors (Manickam,
    2020) such as PH and Soil NPK sensors for monitoring the soil continuously. The
    present STM''s strongest point is its use of an IoT-enabled method to assess soil
    health. Thanks to the existing technology that farmers can precisely administer
    fertilisers, insecticides, and water based on the soil''s nutrients, PH, and type,
    crop disease is reduced, and crop yields are increased. There are still lack of
    sensor assessment based on a specified period, in-depth data analysis, additional
    parameters for optimising soil testing in various existing activities etc. There
    is a demand for an affordable, universal solution that can be used to all kinds
    of farms. 2.7. Weather prediction & monitoring (WPM) An agro weather station (AWS)
    that is intended for farmers and researchers is (Faid et al., 2021) develop using
    four layers: perception, transmission, presentation, and administration. For various
    end users, it offers frequently data and AI-based insights. IoT-based intelligent
    energy-efficient approaches have been originated for monitoring and managing greenhouse
    interior temperatures. Many (Subahi and Bouazza, 2020) simulations utilizing a
    greenhouse temperature transfer function are run to show the usefulness of the
    recommended strategy. For temperature and irrigation control a computerized procedure
    is acquired. Using an Android app that connects (Kori et al., 2021) to the controller,
    many agricultural parameters, including as temperature, humidity, soil wetness,
    and rainfall, are tracked and visualised. A strategy to schedule weather forecasts
    was put out in order to foresee (Li et al., 2019) adoption of weather prediction
    information as well as future energy harvesting values based on historical harvesting
    values. A low-cost solar-powered (Devapal, 2020) soil and weather analysis system
    has been offered that looks at different soil properties and weather patterns
    to set up a high-tech smart farm for farmers. IoT, data mining, and android mobile
    applications are all used in the system''s development. Integrating a provincial
    weather station with dual modules to serve as a LoRa-based soil sensor node (Singh
    et al., 2022) for scrutinizing the state of the soil and the weather. During experiment,
    a LoRa portable communication device and an IoT cloud are used to transmit meteorological
    data. Constructed, and tested a flexible (El-magrous et al., 2019) meteorological-soil
    sensor station for acquiring site-specific maps of soil elements, atmospheric
    information, and yield information for the 2018 soybeans season of cultivation.
    Farmers were able to make well-informed decisions on soil selection, irrigation,
    planting, and harvesting thanks to the use of sophisticated tools for weather
    forecasting and data from already-existing systems. The existing weather monitoring
    and forecasting systems have a number of drawbacks, including the absence of AI
    fault detection approaches, a lack of integration with the existing IoT-based
    agriculture system, and a lack of optimize long-range communication technologies.
    There is a need for an intelligent weather system that can identify the soil''s
    nutritional needs and suggest a suitable crop. 2.8. Soil digging (SDG) To enhance
    tillage processes more significant by fusing IoT, “cloud computing”, and “Decision
    support system” (DESS) technologies (Fawzi et al., 2021) the ”Tillage Operations
    Quality Optimization (TOQO)“ model is constructed using two levels: ”Tillage Depth
    1 (TD1)“ and ”Tillage Depth 2 (TD2)“. TD1 = 10–15 cm and TD2 = 25–30 cm. The TOQO
    standard''s tested results improve long-term evolution for the agribusiness by
    maximizing farmer expenditures, accelerating field productivity, and optimizing
    tillage routines. Real-time monitoring of soil-digging machinery, which enables
    farmers to optimise the depth and spacing of rows or holes, is a strength of the
    current system. This accuracy supports resource utilisation that is efficient
    and minimises reductions in waste. Due to the significant differences in soil
    properties, such as moisture content and hardness, the current system needs to
    be improved in terms of performance, affordability, and sensor calibration. Analysis
    to reduce the environmental impact of soil tilling is still lacking in the system.
    More accurate measurements may be possible by the use of the cutting-edge MCLRN
    algorithm. The average growth rate of research publications published between
    2012 and 2023 for PHRS applications that are based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other
    techniques is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Publication growth rate analysis of PHRS application
    based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. The growth
    rate of publication has been assessed based on the quantity of articles published
    in a given year for a specific PHRS application, such as CYP, CSL, SSL, SGM, DFM,
    STM, WPM, and SDG, and the average growth rate analysis has been assessed based
    on the overall quantity of publications for PHRS application year-wise. As observed
    in Fig. 4 graph, a growing number of publications based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and
    other approaches for PHRS application are made each year, with a high percentage
    of IoT-based PHRS applications. Thus, it can be concluded that the number of PHRS-based
    smart agriculture applications is growing steadily as a result of the convergence
    of IoT, edge, cloud, and AI technologies. 3. During harvesting system (DHRS) After
    preparing the land for the cultivation of crops, there are numerous sub-operations
    engaged during harvesting. The subsystem of the DHRS is shown in Fig. 5. Using
    cutting-edge technologies to automate crop monitoring and irrigation (IoT, MCLRN,
    Data Mining, etc.). It not only emphasises the value of improved production but
    also strongly emphasises data analytics and environmental sustainability. This
    is done to assess the needs and anticipate the compatibility of crops and fertilisers
    in light of the soil and environment. Download : Download high-res image (261KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. DHRS subsystem classification. A wireless
    sensor network is essential for the implementation of smart agriculture (Haseeb
    et al., 2020). There are numerously IoT-enabled prior related work that has been
    done (Ahmed et al., 2018, Anagha et al., 2023, Sah Tyagi et al., 2021) in the
    domain of during the harvesting process. 3.1. Smart irrigation (SIR) Low-cost
    intelligent smart irrigation system using IoT is proposed in three modules. Combined
    (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) sensor module, irrigation module, and sensor communication
    module. The combined sensor module is used to access crop, plantation, and soil-related
    information. After accessing sensor monitoring data it uses a neural network model
    to make an intelligent decision. These decisions are sent to an irrigation module
    and sensor communication module. The aforementioned data determines whether the
    water machine has to be turned on or off in a certain location. The system keeps
    track of incoming data, and the sensor communication module logs it via the MQTT
    broker. The “AtMega 328” microcontroller and (Saraf and Gawali, 2017) Zigbee communications
    are used to monitor and control sensor data in the existing work. Each field''s
    central node stores sensor data in the cloud database. The report on automatic
    irrigation is delivered to a user via an Android application. An intelligent irrigation
    (Alomar and Alazzam, 2018) system is achieved using IoT and fuzzy logic. As environmental
    variables, air climate and humidity sensors, soil wetness sensors, and light intensity
    sensors are used. By utilizing all the sensor information, a Mamdani fuzzy controller
    controls the flow of water. IoT, a DPLRN, and fuzzy computation are combined to
    form an ecosystem for creating a self-sustaining irrigation system. Soil wetness,
    atmospheric (P. Patel et al., 2022) variables, and the state of crops are all
    input variables in this operational simulation. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi, a
    device called an IoT gateway allows for uploading data to the cloud. To estimate
    if a crop is healthy or slumping, an assortment of DPLRN algorithms are used.
    In order to determine the appropriate time to irrigate the crops, all measured
    input variables are analyzed with a fuzzy logic controller. RFID and sensors to
    establish an efficient farm tracking framework exploiting (Saha et al., 2022)
    “Long range wide area network” (LoRaWAN) protocol with six distinct harvesting
    issues, prohibiting fungal attacks on crops, screening cattle, appropriate watering,
    accurate soil wellness inspection, accurate inspection of crops, and enhancing
    productivity. It maintains appropriate irrigation while conserving water by using
    incredibly effective temperature and humidity sensors. Four distinct categories
    of sensors are used in the soil and crop wellness tracking system to gauge the
    “NDVI” readings of the crops, the “pH” rating of the soil, the percentage of nutrients
    that are contained in the soil, the soil''s compaction, and the amount of water
    in the soil. Cowlar is used by the cattle monitoring system to continuously check
    on the health of the cows. Smart farm decision-making powered by IoT and the cloud
    system that has been designed in order to communicate sensor (Lova Raju and Vijayaraghavan,
    2022) data using “NRF24L01” modules. A suitable irrigation is schedule in which
    the author, without (Sayanthan et al., 2018) the assistance of labour, employed
    an Arduino soil moisture analyzer to measure water requirements at various phases
    of eggplant growth. Using an “Arduino Uno R3” board and an “Arduino DUE”, the
    (Jamroen et al., 2020) intelligent irrigation system is scheduled. For data connectivity,
    the “NRF24L01” module is intended. The current method guards against crop water
    stress situations using a fuzzy inference system. The MCLRN-enabled autonomous
    watering mechanism has been constructed. The raspberry pi and (Vij et al., 2020)
    Arduino mega are two different types of microcontrollers employs in this method.
    The Arduino Mega is equipped with a number of sensors. Arduino Mega sends sensor
    data to Raspberry Pi through the wifi module. Weather data will be retrieved using
    an open-source Application programing interface (API), and a raspberry pi will
    operate to alert a system using weather data and sensor node data. A soil type''s
    propensity for irrigation is predicted using MCLRN. A way to regulating irrigation
    (Mohammed et al., 2023) systems using DPLRN that takes into account the moisture
    and soil structure. In their methodology, soil pictures and moisture sensors are
    used to gather data, which is then processed using real-time videos to determine
    the crop''s need for irrigation and moisture levels. A “VGG-19” model analyses
    the type of image and crop seeded to predict irrigation needs. “TensorFlow” lite
    is used to run experiments on cheap computational hardware and test the proposed
    model on a private dataset. A remote irrigation water pump monitoring, management,
    and (Kirar, 2022) security is developed. The sensors used in this work to detect
    supply voltage and motor current to estimate operating conditions and offer protection.
    The user receives the measured parameters via the SIM900 GSM component regarding
    the intent of remote oversight and management. The Android application was created
    with a better user interface, timer-based functionality, notifications for feedback
    and pump status, among other features. An ATmega 328P microprocessor that is included
    into the Arduino Uno board protects the pump. To track agricultural factors like
    temperature and relative humidity (Hamouda and Elhabil, 2017) a greenhouse smart
    management mechanism is suggested. The watering and cooling of greenhouses are
    managed and controlled automatically by the system. An intelligent system is created
    to track and control several subsystems, including irrigation, (Cecchetti and
    Ruscelli, 2022) lighting, heating, and solar. To enable sensor data to be connected
    to the farm Ethernet network, RS485 bus Ethernet convertor is employed. Automation
    of the heating system, irrigation system, circulation pump, and solenoid valve
    are accomplished using a relay board coupled to a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller,
    which is controlled using the HTTP. PHP scripts handle the system''s overall business
    logic. A connected device WSN is created using the “SIXFAB” module (Kiani and
    Seyyedabbasi, 2018) to irrigate crops in agricultural fields, and the Arduino
    component of the module transmits data to a Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway. One
    of the strengths of the existing SIR system is its use of WSNs and machine learning
    techniques for monitoring and scheduling irrigation of crops for large and small
    farming fields by collecting wet and dry soil data according to the climate and
    soil condition, which ensures crops are irrigated at the right time and irrigation
    systems optimize crop growth. There should be irrigation and crop-specific field
    monitoring, which are weaknesses of the current approaches. The current system
    relies on a single kind of irrigation for a variety of crops. There are lackings
    of self-sustaining system and sensor calibration system. Based on the soil nutrients,
    moisture, temperature, and humidity, more data analysis needs to be done. Heuristic
    techniques for improving irrigation and minimising water use are still lacking.
    To prevent water waste for different crops, the water irrigation system can be
    scheduled or rain harvesting strategies need to be used. Transparency of sensor
    data is lacking. The current process is unable to communicate with another system.
    The system''s performance can be enhanced by using simple cryptographic techniques
    to safeguard data flowing from all the sensors. Communication over long distances
    for data is still unpredictable. 3.2. Soil health monitoring and fertilizer management
    (SHMFM) A methodical approach that accumulates instantaneous data from the farm
    site, such as light strength, wetness of the soil, surface temperature, humidity,
    etc was proposed to provide local access (Bachuwar et al., 2018) to soil temperature,
    humidity, soil wetness, and light intensity, an ESP826612E transmits sensor data
    over a Wi-Fi network using the “IEEE 802.11” protocol. A method to produce data
    sources made up of temperature, humidity, and N, P, and K nutrient content (Rahman
    et al., 2019) that are produced from soil data sensor readings. In order to create
    a soil fertility data warehouse, sensor data is uploaded using IoT technologies.
    By combining Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) in
    a novel NPK sensor (G et al., 2020) an IoT-based system took into account. To
    determine whether N, P, and K deficiencies exist in the soil chosen for testing,
    the Mamdani inference procedure is used. At regular intervals, the farmer is alerted
    to the quantity of fertilizer to be applied. A technique that (Postolache et al.,
    2022) can aid in the evaluation of changes in soil nutrients for more effective
    administration of drainage and fertiliser control. The appliance may gather information
    on the amount of NPK in the soil, further information on soil temperature, conductivity,
    pH, and moisture. A solar fertigation control mechanism for watering using a hybrid
    model and forecasting control (Ahmad et al., 2022) is built on a weather-based
    system accompanied by a crop a repository controlled by real-time sensors that
    keep track of the water condition of the plants as well as the soil moisture and
    water quality. The continuous gauging system for evaluating the water in the soil
    and nutrients for citrus (Zhang et al., 2017) moisture and nutrient status in
    citrus orchards, so that fruit farmers can understand their orchard''s condition
    in time and adjust fertilization and irrigation strategies according to the data.
    To make it simpler for farmers to plant citrus seeds, (Pratama et al., 2021) an
    IoT-enabled gadget that indicates the soil''s nutrients for citrus seedlings using
    a “NPK” indicators and feeds the outcomes to the Thingspeak cloud. A soil wetness
    monitoring system was developed using LoRaWAN detectors with (Hossain et al.,
    2022) blended transmission modules, no in-field root stations or routers, and
    an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based mobile router to retrieve the gauges of
    soil wetness taken from buried indicators for a variety of crops. A continuous
    measurement system is proposed for soil nutrition content using an automated fertilizer
    unit for (Visvesvaran et al., 2021) greenhouse systems. The fertilizer system
    automatically provides the plants with the nutrients required once the measurement
    value reduces under the trigger value. The NodeMSU is utilized throughout the
    system for data communication. The performance of the LoRaWAN network beats that
    of the current system for long-distance data transmission, and the “Mamdani inference”
    optimization method based on IoT fuzzy logic yields the best results for measuring
    soil health. From the discussion above, it can be seen that the current system
    has some drawbacks, such as a lack of standardisation due to the fact that different
    soil sensors use different data formats and protocols to collect data. Due to
    the dependence of soil temperature on climate, sensor calibration is still lacking.
    To better manage soil surface and fertilisation, the current system has to be
    optimized. 3.3. Disease detection and analysis (DDAN) For autonomously identifying
    and categorising plant diseases from leaf photos, a DPLRN algorithm is suggested.
    Using the collected images, (Sladojevic et al., 2016) CNNs are trained and validated
    along with fine-tuning. A convolutional neural network model with squeeze net
    architecture is utilised (Hidayatuloh et al., 2018) to distinguish between healthy
    and diseased tomato plant leaves. There are four steps to creating a DPLRN based
    (Andrianto et al., 2020) smartphone application for spotting rice plant diseases.
    These are creating a system architecture for plant disease detection, creating
    a cloud server application and a smartphone application, testing the smartphone
    application, and assessing the system''s performance. The MLP simulation of plant
    diseases, which acquires information as 10 characteristics and 4139 data points,
    was put forward as a real-time (Kumar et al., 2021) detection method. The four
    common forms of disorders are accurately detected by the neural network. An app
    for cellphones that makes use of deep convolutional neural networks to (Pallagani
    et al., 2019) anticipate crop diseases. A total of 38 different diseases have
    been predicted by the app. Farmers everywhere can make use of it even without
    an internet connection. Controlling a pandemic illness with an IoT-based gauge
    is a crucial agricultural (Khattab et al., 2019) application. The system architecture
    can forecast a variety of plant diseases, and the model has been put to the test
    on tomato and potato crops in lab settings. An electronic method designed to communicate
    with mobile phones (Nagasubramanian et al., 2021) to manipulate disease classification,
    environmental objects, and farmer suggestions. MCLRN algorithms, SVMs, and CNNs
    are used to develop the farming suggestion. A leaf detection analysis is put forward
    using (Thorat et al., 2017) an assortment of sensors, such as temperature and
    soil moisture meters, etc. After processing, the leaf image is collected and uploaded
    to the server. The status of the leaf disease is also communicated to the farmer
    via the mobile app. Using “MDFC-ResNet” and DPLRN-based IoT (Hu et al., 2020)
    devices, a crop diagnosis of illnesses IoT system for several crop types is being
    developed. A publicly accessible collection of 54,306 pictures of ailing and healthy
    plant leaves has been assembled (Mohanty et al., 2016) in which a deep CNNs was
    utilised to identify 14 crop types and 26 illnesses from this controlled sample.
    An IoT-based system that uses MCLRN to deliver conveniently (Truong et al., 2017)
    available real-time local environmental data in rural crop fields. With the method,
    it is possible to both identify fungal illnesses and forecast their potential
    spread among crop fields. A “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based technique for
    plant disease identification is designed. Once the model has been trained using
    (Adeola et al., 2022) MCLRN methods, it is transformed into a lightweight model
    with a kilobyte (KB) size that can be placed into devices with external memory.
    Tensorflow lite is used to perform the model conversion with the already installed
    library. The existing method''s strength is its effectiveness in locating the
    illness at the plant''s root system using information on the soil and environment
    of a given region. The performance of the “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based
    technique to identify the kind of sickness was superior to that of existing DPLRN
    systems. For gathering a vast number of statistics on various plants and climatic
    circumstances, the aforementioned existing method still has several shortcomings.
    Lack of ability to detect and control various diseases. To identify plant diseases,
    several existing systems used CNN-based DPLRN algorithms, but the algorithm performance
    still has to be optimized in terms of accuracy, usefulness and real time plant
    disease analysis. 3.4. Pathogens detection (PDT) Biosensors possessed the ability
    to develop into the forefront of diagnostic techniques for various fields of biological
    studies, which comprises immediate assessment of human blood (Sonu and Chaudhary,
    2022) ingredients for both animal and plant infection recognition, environmental
    surveillance, and airborne pathogen identification. As a result variety of techniques
    for detection of (R. Patel et al., 2022) plant pathogens and mechanisms of biosensing
    systems have been examined, whose two main categories of conventional analytical
    methods for the detection of plant diseases are the “Digital droplet polymerase
    chain reaction” and the “Quantum dots-based biosensor”. The exploration of techniques
    for agricultural disease detection is the overall strength of the present work.
    The analysis illustrates the benefits of miniaturized sensors in terms of convenience
    in production; affordability, speed of reaction, and responsiveness, establishing
    those instruments useful for observations in the field. In terms of high levels
    of automation, the work currently being done for pathogen detection still has
    a research gap. It is lacking sensor standardisation. It is necessary to improve
    the methods for detecting various pathogen types, sensor calibration, dataset
    gathering, and technology integration. A cheap sensor needs to be deployed in
    the creation of an affordable, eco-friendly system. Due to the need for further
    optimisation of IoT-enabled systems, there is still a gap in field testing. 3.5.
    Pest controlling (PCN) IoT and CNN-based insect recognition techniques are combined
    in a system. The technology is (Ramalingam et al., 2020) utilized by pest management
    businesses to keep an eye on pests in a variety of settings, including food storage
    areas, hospitals, gardens, etc. Using the IoT for crop monitoring and pest control
    (Tian et al., 2021) an infrastructure for simultaneous and collaborative simulation
    strategy has been provided. Based on the results, the applied simulation with
    IoT assistance system is the most efficient and accurate solution. An artificial
    IoT and DPLRN (Chen et al., 2020) technology can be used to analyze crop growth
    and predict pest occurrences in an environment. A neural network algorithm called
    “You Only Look Once (YOLO)” is used to identify pests in images. A system for
    the detection and control of pests embedded in an embedded environment is proposed
    in which (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2019) if the acceptable limit gets surpassed in
    terms of both temperature and humidity, then the “raspberry pi” captures the image
    of the plant and compares it to the database, and if pests are found, the farmers
    are notified to fertilize. A “Multi-Agent System (MAS)” by deploying a (Debauche
    et al., 2020) Docker environment orchestrated by “Kubernetes” in the Edge AI-IoT
    architecture is constructed. The system utilizes an AI algorithm to identify plant
    diseases and pests and uses an irrigation pivot to treat the crop. The positive
    aspects of MCLRN algorithms like KNN and the (Materne and Inoue, 2018) linear
    regression framework are used to construct a prediction model in a plantation
    to forecast disease and insect outbreaks. The upside of already-existing systems
    is that building a decentralized and accordance simulation structure with the
    IoT for pest control and crop monitoring in combination to increase crop yields,
    lessens the load on one GPU, and contributes to the operation evenly and concurrently
    with all accessible GPUs and perceives data. Based on the usefulness of data,
    the current pest management method still has a gap. For a robotic technique based
    on DPLRN to detect different kinds of insects and rodents, the current solution
    still has to be improved. Due to various data formats and IoT protocols, there
    are still issues when integrating the current system with another system. The
    amount of manual field monitoring by farmers can be decreased, for example, by
    merging deep irrigation systems with current pest management techniques. By including
    preprocessing to normalise the image before the prediction to minimise the effects
    of photo exposure (varying light intensity in outdoor situations), plant disease
    and pest detection can be enhanced. IoT-based security and privacy of sent data
    still require improvement. 3.6. Weed detection (WDT) Robotic weed control that
    uses MCLRN and IoT to detect weeds in onion fields and (Arakeri et al., 2017)
    spray them with the required herbicide. Installing a weed detecting system in
    a chilli (Islam et al., 2021) field using RADF, KNN, and SVM, among other MCLRN
    and image processing algorithms. Systems were built using MATLAB. In order to
    identify weeds in soybean crops (Razfar et al., 2022) a DPLRN based vision-based
    weed identification system is prepared. Three unique CNNs models and MobileNetV2
    are employed in the five-layer DPLRN architecture. In order to increase agricultural
    productivity (Dasgupta et al., 2020) a concept is suggested by utilizing wireless
    sensor networks and AI models for crop forecast and weed identification. In this
    approach, MCLRN is used to create a model after data are collected from sensors
    via WSN. CNN is used in conjunction with this to detect marijuana in drone-taken
    photo. An algorithm is designed based on CNNs to identify and (Jabir and Falih,
    2022) locate weeds in wheat harvests in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Morocco,
    using an intelligent system. The YOLO model is used to construct a real-time detection
    and identification model on the Raspberry Pi. A network is established for detecting
    weeds (Kulkarni and Angadi, 2019) using a CNN. The CNN is constructed as a pooling
    layer, and the activation function is a “ReLU”. A remote-controlled robot based
    on a Raspberry (Dankhara et al., 2019) Pi is used to detect weed using an image
    processing technique. A model has been formed for precision (Karthikeyan et al.,
    2021) agriculture based on K-means clustering to classify weed plants. A “CNN”
    technique associated with IoT is used for image processing. When compared to another
    neural network technique, the performance of a WSN employing a Raspberry-based
    system with the DPLRN approach is superior. More accurate results were obtained.
    The above-discussed existing work has flaws based on real-time mobile application
    monitoring of weed detection; more parameters can be added to make the DPLRN model
    performance optimised so that real-time weed can be detected accurately; and analysis
    of weed mapping method still has a gap where more research can be carried out.
    Improvements still need to be made to real-time UAV-based technique optimisation.
    The existing system does not incorporate the integration of various environmental
    sensors, actuators, or feedback controllers for monitoring. More research is still
    needed to develop a custom deep learning algorithm that can identify different
    weed types based on plants. 3.7. Crop losses (CLO) To gain an adequate understanding
    of crop health, an apparatus has been (Shafi et al., 2020) put together that combines
    multi-modal data from the IoT nodes and drone photos. The fused data was subjected
    to MCLRN and DPLRN algorithms for crop health classification and creating health
    maps. Data from the sensor nodes is transmitted via a LoRa module. The system
    is intended to design, develop, and test a next generation of automated (Pérez-Ruiz
    et al., 2015) and robotic systems for efficient pest management in agriculture
    and forestry operations using a real-time kinematics (RTK) and “Global positioning
    system” (GPS) controlled autonomous tractor for straight-line tracking. A drone-based
    system is designed in which a “Raspberry Pi” module is integrated (Saha et al.,
    2018) with an array of 64 separate temperature sensors over 12C, an RGB-D camera
    for taking real-time photos, and a GPS navigation module. The cloud server receives
    and stores all sensor data. A system that makes use of multiple sensors to assess
    the temperature, humidity, pH level and scent of the leaves is compared and examined
    (Giri Babu and Anjan Babu, 2020) to check if the gathered leaf values fall within
    the range specified in the actual dataset for tracking crop health. Using IoT
    and remote sensing (Shukla et al., 2021) a method is proposed for agricultural
    health monitoring. To identify healthy crops, IOT-connected UAVs and MCLRN are
    used. Prescription maps are important because they make use of resources like
    pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Farmers are able to decide what resources
    are necessary to ensure that crops are healthy at every stage of growth. An IoT
    platform is constructed that uses image processing and a classifier algorithm
    to detect plant illnesses. If an (Ayalew et al., 2022) automatic medicine system
    identifies ailments, a sprinkler sprays medication. Additionally, disease transmission
    is tracked based on changes in weather using soil humidity and temperature sensors.
    An automated decision-making (Grimblatt et al., 2021) tools and metrics that track
    plant development and health, which have an immediate and measurable effect on
    farmers'' ability to produce crops. Experiments are carried out using two separate
    sensors, soil moisture and temperature, to ascertain the significance of each
    parameter as the foundation for plant growth. An agricultural production system
    simulation is designed (Matsumoto et al., 2017) to carry out intricate business-based
    assessments of the abundance of inventories and crop destruction brought on by
    an absence of knowledge about the quantity of food acquired, the number of unit
    crops, and the enlargement of cultivated fields. IoT-Edge module (Park and Kim,
    2021) collects strawberry hydroponic environment data and strawberry photos, allowing
    for monitoring and determining strawberry harvest time. Utilizing a Wide-area
    inexpensively network (LPWAN) based on the “NB-IoT” (Chang et al., 2018) a smart
    lighting system is developed for greenhouses of expensive crops. Using the temperature,
    humidity, and methane gas sensors MQ4, LDR, and DHT11 (Mahfuz et al., 2020) an
    embedded system is established based on microcontrollers. Its purpose is to keep
    track of the atmosphere all over the greenhouse. In the event that any sensor
    value is outside of its acceptable range, the Arduino will send the user a notification
    SMS using a SIM 900 GSM modem. Through the Android app, a new threshold value
    is also configured. The performance of the smart monitoring of healthy crops is
    outperformed by the IoT that utilises drone and hybrid MCLRN to detect healthy
    crops in the growing environment. The data is transmitted quickly and cheaply
    between the edge and the cloud using an LPWAN based on the “NB-IoT”. It has been
    determined through research of the already-existing system previously described
    that there is still a gap in monitoring and controlling the crop from numerous
    losses. The current system is missing data processing steps and robotic sensors
    with intelligence that can detect different soil parameters, such as soil PH,
    soil water levels, and other characteristics. The ability for mobile-based applications
    to provide the end user with real-time access to farming field information from
    any location still needs refinement. For example, alerts for watering plants,
    temperature control notifications, and disease detection alarms based on the disease
    types and how this disease might be controlled. The examination of extensive data
    based on various crop types is still lacking. Because of climatic circumstances,
    dissimilar data formats, and dissimilar communication protocols, the system is
    not self-sustaining; it is dependent on a certain region and environmental condition.
    It is also unable to integrate with another subsystem. Fig. 6 exhibits the average
    annual growth rate of papers on research produced throughout 2012 and 2023 for
    DHRS implementations based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other procedures. Download :

    growth rate analysis of DHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other
    methodology from 2012 to 2023. According to Fig. 6, the DHRS application research
    publication growth rate analysis has been conducted similarly to that of the PHRS
    application research publication growth rate analysis. The DHRS publishing analysis
    graph shows an increase in the number of research published articles year over
    year. Comparing IoT-based DHRS applications to AI, MCLRN, and other techniques,
    the publishing growth rate was higher between 2019 and 2022. This is because more
    research is being done on SIR, DDAN, and CLO-based applications. In comparison
    to the period from 2012 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of publications
    for SIR-based applications between 2019 and 2022 has been calculated to be 69.23
    %. In contrast, between 2019 and 2022, the average growth rates for CLO and DDAN,
    respectively, were 53.26 % and 63.98 %. It is therefore possible to predict that
    there will be an increase in the number of research publications using IoT and
    AI-based approaches for developing DHRS applications. 4. Post harvesting system
    (POHRS) When preparing the ground for agricultural cultivation, farmers that practice
    traditional farming face a number of challenges. These challenges were brought
    on by the rising demand for agricultural production, and it is not simple to match
    this rising demand for food processing, storage, and supply. The Fig. 7 shows
    the post-harvesting subsystem in which various existing research work has been
    done based on storage, harvesting cycle, supply chain, food processing, etc. (Abouelsaad
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. POHRS subsystem classification. The post-harvest physiology
    and management of fruits and vegetables are covered in this area, along with topics
    like harvesting, handling, packaging, storage, hygienic practises, transportation,
    crop waste, etc. In the context of severe weather, it also covered postharvest
    handling. 4.1. Reaping, sorting, cooling, and storage (RSCS) An agricultural robot
    design is incorporated that would use “Autodesk Fusion 360″ (Sazid et al., 2022)
    and ”Webots Simulator“ for reaping, seed sowing, excavating, unmanned ploughing,
    watering, fertilising, and harvesting. “Proteus 8.9” simulates the complete system.
    For data analysis, “MATLAB” is being used. An IoT-based microcontroller farm robot
    automates the system as a whole. An IoT-based low-cost solution is structured
    in which warehouse''s (Banerjee et al., 2020) hazardous gas, CO2, is detected
    using a gas sensor. Tilts or lateral motions of the rack are picked up by shock
    sensors. To safeguard grains from fire, a warning is issued if a fire flame is
    discovered. The Node-Red dashboard allows a user to view the findings of live
    sensor data anywhere, at any time. IoT has been used to monitor and manage food
    grain waste in warehouses. A “DHT11” indicator (Devi et al., 2021) for temperature
    and humidity, a CO2 sensor for air quality, a PIR sensor for moving object detection,
    and other sensors are integrated using “Arduino” to act as a rat and insect repellant.
    A fan is activated to cool the room if the temperature and humidity are above
    and below, respectively, the threshold levels. All sensor node data is accessible
    on the mobile application. Immediate terms surveillance equipment powered by IoT
    that (Siddiqua et al., 2022) can track temperature, humidity, brightness, and
    gas concentration in freezing storage and notify the user of potentially dangerous
    values when the levels surpass the thresholds. The “Arduino UNO” microcontroller
    regulates sensor data and provides it to the ESP32. The MIT App Inventor is used
    on either a computer or an Android phone to monitor the status of the storage
    room. Using a combination of blockchain technology (Sangeetha et al., 2021) a
    system for gauging crop quality and monitoring storage that links farmers with
    distributors directly. Data is gathered in real-time both in the warehouse and
    on the field. All sensor nodes are linked together using Arduino, and information
    is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway using Lora communication.
    Farmers and distributors can visualise and analyse data via a web application,
    which is stored in Azure SQL databases. The invention of a stated IoT-enabled
    warehouse management system in which (Anoop et al., 2021) the NodeMSU microcontroller
    is set up to receive temperature and humidity data in this study. A DT method
    is used to examine the temperature swings that took place in Kerala during the
    past five years. To assess and display the warehouse''s climate state, this climate
    data is transmitted to the cloud server Thingspeak. A system based on IoT is established
    for controlling and monitoring food (Hema et al., 2020) instantaneous grain storage
    and procurement. To monitor the overall status under the granary, the system makes
    use of gauges for climate control, moisture, gas, real-time clocks, and burning
    flame gauges. Sensor data is visualized using the thingSpeak cloud platform. An
    MQTT-based application control warehouse system is developed for fruits and vegetables
    storage. Using MQTT and COAP protocol (Deshmukh and Bhalerao, 2017) sensor information
    can be displayed on a web page and accessed via mobile apps. Compared two techniques,
    ”Evaporative Cooling Chambers“ (ECCs) (Verploegen et al., 2018) and ”clay pot
    coolers,“ and proposed employing non-electric cooling and storage devices as a
    potential solution to the post-harvest warehouse issues in rural Mali. An IoT-enabled
    approach is structured that employs sensors to track the condition of agricultural
    fields and warehouses in real-time. The (Nayak et al., 2022) necessary region
    is surrounded by a number of sensors that can identify any impending dangers and
    notify the appropriate people. The infrastructure for safeguarding the harvested
    crops in the warehouse and monitoring the same in real time through an IoT sensor
    network performs better than the performance of the entire existing system for
    developing refrigeration sections through WSN-based clay pots. The system is affordable
    and accessible to all farmers. The aforementioned summary of current research
    has a number of drawbacks based on harvesting, storing, and cooling. There is
    a dearth of smart alert notifications in the storage system. The current storage
    system still lacks real-time monitoring of insects and rodents. There is a need
    for such a sophisticated intelligent-based algorithm that can regulate the warehouse''s
    temperature automatically in accordance with diverse environmental factors and
    locales. For different fruits and vegetables, storage systems should be based
    on weight and long-term storage capability, which is still lacking in the current
    work. On the security and usability of the system at the user end, there is a
    research gap. To boost the performance of the current system, other sensors can
    be added, including RFID, sound sensors, and various gas sensors. 4.2. Crop waste
    management (CWM) A solution to identify (Chihana et al., 2018) warehouse breaches
    and track grains using IoT prototypes is suggested. The usage of cloud storage,
    WSN, and RFID technologies increases accountability and efficiency while reducing
    theft and administrative mistakes. Using an IR sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi
    module a smart garbage management (Jayalakshmi et al., 2017) system built on IOT.
    After garbage levels reach maximum, dustbins are cleaned as soon as possible.
    A framework is formed for smart (Bong Cassendra P. C. et al., 2018) agriculture
    based on a smart waste management perspective. The author discusses the various
    sensor and communication protocols that can be used to track the waste of crops
    in agriculture. The current system''s main strength is its ability to collect
    data instantaneously on the amount and type of agricultural waste. These data
    are examined using cloud computing to determine where crop waste is accumulating
    and to evaluate the risk of fire, illness, and pest infestation. Satellite images
    and ground-based sensors can be used to monitor crop waste degradation. Farmers
    at present have access to information on greenhouse gas emissions and decomposition
    rates. According to a study of previous research, smart agro-waste control research
    is still in its early stages. Low-energy power sensors and sophisticated techniques
    for managing post-harvest waste are not used. Research is still needed for all
    forms of crop loss management. 4.3. Transportation and tracking (TTN) A three-layer
    perishable generate fog computing model is proposed (Musa and Vidyasankar, 2017)
    in which the RFID-embedded sensors that generate sensor readings for the monitoring
    and control layer are among the data producers. A system for the effective distribution
    and transportation of fresh fruit is developed by utilizing the MQ3 sensor. The
    (Elavarasi et al., 2019) system''s result was that it lessened fruit contamination.
    When damaged fruit is discovered, an SMS is delivered to the user''s mobile device,
    and through a remote, the system removes the spoiled fruit using a pick-and-place
    robot. In this article the author go into great (Onwude et al., 2020) detail about
    how cutting food losses during postharvest cold chain activities might enhance
    food security. IoT and blockchain were suggested (Pervez and Haq, 2019) as a means
    of digitally disrupting supply chains and logistics. The supply-chain architecture
    built on a block chain is designed using a direct acyclic graph data structure.
    The IoT-based technologies used in the management of the agricultural supply chain
    in a developing nation like India are discussed. Real-time data sharing (Luthra
    et al., 2018) uses embedded components including actuators, sensors, and network
    connectivity. Digital technologies enable the (Dadi et al., 2021) creation of
    effective agri-food supply networks. “Big data” and IoT are a combination of several
    technologies that the system uses to evaluate enormous amounts of information
    quickly. RFID can sense the food environment. The Blockchain-based supply chain
    management plan (Bhutta and Ahmad, 2021) that places an emphasis on employing
    IoT devices and Blockchain technology to securely identify, trace, and track agricultural
    food during transportation. The methods used to anticipate backorders include
    SVM, KNN, RADF, and AdaBoost. The IoT-based dairy supply chain model is suggested
    and put into practise. In which (Jachimczyk et al., 2021) the related solution
    and the domain-oriented knowledge model are well matched for the integration and
    synergy-enabling processes. RFID is used to capture and share data for production,
    warehousing, sales, supply, and other processes. Advocated in China by integrating
    blockchain and RFID in the (Feng Tian, 2016) supply chain. Information is transferred
    securely and made public via the traceability system by using blockchain. Real-time
    monitoring of the climate, humidity, and geolocation guarantees that harvested
    crops get to their destination in the best feasible conditions, reducing spoiling
    and improving crop quality. Blockchain technology leveraging RFID-based sensor
    nodes optimises supply chains for all crops in real-time. It reduces waste and
    guarantees that crops get there at their intended location in the best feasible
    condition. It has been determined from the discussion of the TTN''s current system
    that the secure supply chain technique has to be updated for all agricultural
    products. Sensor-based technologies, device security and failure, software security,
    and power management all require improvement. The current infrastructure does
    not allow for the dynamic scheduling of transportation based on the agricultural
    products'' shelf lives. There are significant research gaps in the areas of cloud
    platform load balancing, computational cost, and security protocol. Logistical
    processes based on smart contracts can be added to the system to increase its
    efficiency and power. There is still a need for an autonomous system that unifies
    numerous subsystems using IoT with technologies like blockchain and AI. 4.4. Food
    processing (FDP) “Big data” analytics, MCLRN, and the IoT are used to build a
    (Konur et al., 2023) cyber-physical / IoT based food manufacturing system. The
    intelligent production control system offers intelligent decision assistance.
    A tools is structured for tracking and (Jagtap et al., 2021) lowering energy and
    water consumption (FEW), as well as a decision-support system with pertinent hardware
    and software components, utilizing an IoT four-layer architecture. FEW data are
    gathered and used in the food manufacturing sector to examine and improve procedures.
    The food processing system is more effective when IoT, big data analytics, MCLRN,
    and cyber-physical systems are incorporated than when they are automated. Additionally,
    this analysis teaches data professionals new information about how to forecast
    the baking process for achieving product consistency. Productivity may be raised,
    and performance and profitability can be raised by analyzing these data. The current
    research has been examined for individual agricultural goods. For all agricultural
    goods, testing can be done based on the ingredients and food processing. It is
    necessary to integrate seamless IoT devices to improve food processing. The current
    system lacks a strong security system to safeguard system data. Based on IoT,
    AI, MCLRN, and other processes, Fig. 8 presents the average annual growth rate
    estimation of research publication for POHRS application from 2012 to 2023. Download

    Publication growth rate analysis of POHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN
    and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. For the TTN and RSCS system implementations,
    a large number of research articles have been published between 2018 and 2022.
    The average growth rate for the IoT and blockchain-based TTN system has been measured
    as 63.23 % between 2018 and 2021, and the average growth rate has been measured
    for the IoT and AI-based system for storage and cooling at 58.41 % between 2018
    and 2021. However, there has been less growth in research publications on the
    topics of IoT and AI for the other POHRS applications, such as FDP, CWM, sorting,
    and cooling, between 2012 and 2022. Therefore, there is a need for greater study
    in that area. Using IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other methodology categories, the average
    growth rate of research papers for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS was 41.12 %, 43.23 %,
    and 36.10 %, respectively, till January 2023. 5. Metaheuristic based algorithm
    in smart agriculture application From growing to reaping, an agricultural application
    (Kiani et al., 2022a) uses a meta-heuristic approach. In the first unit, the “Sand
    Cat Swarm Optimization” (SCSO) based algorithm has been created to delegate the
    cultivation work to the appropriate autonomous machines, reducing the labor factor.
    In the second unit, IoT devices keep track of cultivated crops. For crop harvesting
    in the third unit, an improved “ANT colony optimization” (ACO) algorithm has been
    created. A 3D strategy approach has been (Kiani et al., 2022b) employed using
    a couple of Progressive enhancement Grey Wolf Optimisation (I-GWO) and Improved
    Grey Wolf Optimisation (Ex-GWO) for self-sustaining farm operations to search
    for a collision-free feasible route in a sufficient period with minimal expenditure
    in various atmospheric conditions and for multiple barriers. The goal is to tackle
    the NP-hard problem of successful crop harvesting by identifying the finest and
    most suitable paths for UAVs. The results indicate an endeavor to avoid any local
    optima pitfalls and determine the most effective response in an adequate span
    of duration. The fuzzy logic-based “Non-dominated sorting (Fathollahi-Fard et
    al., 2023) genetic algorithm” (NSGEA) model has been developed as a metaheuristic
    optimization strategy where the model incorporates the advantage of multiple factors
    of apprehension such as harvesters'' effectiveness, waves of crops that become
    ripe, parameter weather, as well as adjustments in the value of commodities. The
    framework takes into consideration a wide range of desired results, including
    profitability optimization, preventing waste, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction,
    and it is utilized to calculate the optimum amount of day''s labor for farmers
    and laborers on every block of land. The usefulness of the currently available
    SCSO, ACO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, and NSGEA metaheuristic algorithms put into effect in
    IoT-based agriculture exceeded other approaches, and the model suggested may be
    used for different applications in a variety of agricultural areas. There are
    still some issues with the optimised performance technique that is currently being
    used to solve NP-hard issues in the field of smart agriculture. Lack of standardisation
    for big croplands utilising IoT and IoT of transportation employing a portable
    robot system to monitor the farming field based on SIR, SCL, CSL, CYP, SGM, SSL,
    STM, SHMFM, DDAN, PDT, WDT, PCN, CLO, TTN, FDP, and RSCS. While supply chain optimizer
    for several harvested crops is currently lacking, the used NSGEA algorithms in
    multiobjective problems can be extended by “Benders decomposition” or “Lagrangian
    relaxation”. 6. Technologies based on the IoT for smart agriculture The development
    of IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems has relied on a variety of technologies
    in the past. It is possible to use this technology wirelessly or wiredly. It is
    conceivable to build an infrastructure for intelligent agriculture at a low cost
    by combining sensors, controllers, and communication technologies. Through the
    synthesis of IoT, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and cloud computing,
    IoT-enabled technologies have made advancements in developing smart agriculture
    systems as well. This section analyses various technologies for developing smart
    agriculture systems in the different major areas of farming operations on the
    basis of discussion in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application. The estimation average rate of several technologies utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS system is depicted in Fig. 9 of the graph.
    According to the existing survey (Kalyani and Collier, 2021) and proposed survey
    report, this is the estimated percentage of technologies used in smart agriculture
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Growth rate of various technologies used in PHRS, DHRS, POHRS subsystem
    between 2012 and 2022. According to an average percentage analysis of various
    technologies conducted between 2012 and 2022, the use of IoT and other technologies
    for the development of smart agriculture would increase by 2028 (Research and
    Markets, 2023). Table 1 presents cutting-edge technologies, sensor or devices
    that can be applied to build smart agriculture using IoT architecture (Chamara
    et al., 2022) based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. From Table 1 it can be seen that
    the use of IoT has advanced the field of smart agriculture from 2012 to 2023.
    The advancement has been done by deploying various IoT devices / sensors (Pyingkodi
    et al., 2022), wireless communication protocols (Khanh et al., 2022), and UAVs
    using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies to automate the farming
    field operations (Boursianis et al., 2022). It is possible to communicate from
    machine to machine using a variety of communication standards (Orfanos et al.,
    2023). Table 1. Analysis of Technologies used in the smart agriculture between

    The graph in Fig. 10 represent how much data is consumed in GBPS by PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems. This data bandwidth estimate is evaluated and (Annual Internet,
    2023; Virtual Cisco, 2017) measured using prior research. This information is
    obtained through a variety of IoT sensors and actuators, including cameras, DHT
    temperature and humidity sensors, air pressure sensors, rain sensors, distance
    sensors, water flow metres, and others. These sensors and actuators are utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Information for real-time crop
    management is updated often, like every minute or hour. In the upcoming years,
    it is anticipated that the average data bandwidth for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems would keep expanding. The rapid development of sensors and actuators,
    as well as the rising demand for real-time crop management data, are to blame
    for this. As technology has developed, the maximum data bandwidth for IoT-based
    smart agriculture systems has increased year over year. The available data bandwidth
    for various IoT based PHRS, DHRS and POHRS applications from 2012 to 2022 is shown
    in the graph Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download : Download

    wise for various IoT based subsystems in smart agriculture. IoT technologies were
    still in their infancy between 2012 and 2014, and data storage capacity for applications
    in the IoT remained quite constrained. Data rates ranging from a few kilobyte
    per second (Kbps) to a few megabyte per second (Mbps) were accessible via wireless
    technologies including 2G and 3G cellular networks, which were widely used. The
    data bandwidth for IoT applications has increased dramatically between 2015 and
    2018 thanks to 4G LTE cellular networks technologies. Higher data speeds were
    offered by 4G networks, which typically oscillated between tens of Mbps to hundreds
    of Mbps. This made it possible to collect and analyse more data thoroughly while
    also enabling the transfer of data more quickly. Improvements to 4G networks and
    the rollout of 5G networks, which promise even more data bandwidth and lower latency,
    started in 2019 to 2021. Data rates of up to several gigabits per second (Gbps)
    are available with 5G technology. Even while 5G was not yet widely available,
    its promise for fast data transfer was becoming more and more clear. The global
    rollout of 5G networks, which are currently in development, will continue in 2022
    and 2023. This will result in enhanced data bandwidth for IoT-based smart agriculture
    applications. Although the actual data rates that can be achieved in real-world
    settings depend on network coverage and infrastructure, the data bandwidth needed
    for IoT-based smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems might vary depending on the
    implementation and the amount of data being communicated. The overall bandwidth
    needs will be influenced by elements including the volume of data gathering, the
    number of sensors placed, and the complexity of the data being conveyed. Communication
    involves a number of factors, such as the data rate, the frequency bands, the
    range, the application, and the cost. A systematic analysis of these factors has
    been conducted in Table 2 to determine which communication standards are to be
    used in PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystem. As from Table 1 and Table 2, some IoT-based
    communication technologies can also be considered in the 5G/5G beyond smart agriculture
    system. Table 2. Comparative analysis of various communication technologies used

    collected based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. This dataset can be used to solve a
    problem in CYP, SSL, SIR, DDAN, PCN, WDT, and CWM operations. Existing public
    dataset has been reviewed for several farming operations (Lu and Young, 2020)
    including SSL, DDAN, WDT, CWM, etc., and classified this dataset based on the
    specific problem that can be solved using the IoT based computer vision algorithm
    for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Including some existing external datasets
    created by various authors can be found in Table 3. This collection includes many
    plant-leaf diseases that affect fruits, vegetables, and seeds. For instance, tomatoes,
    brinjal, potatoes, guava, wheat, cotton, apples, oranges, and so forth. Table
    3. Analysis of dataset that can be used for developing smart agriculture based
    subsystem. References Details (Rauf and Lali, 2021) This dataset of healthy and
    unhealthy guava fruits and leaves can be used to solve plant disease-related issues
    using computer vision techniques. The illness categories in this image dataset
    are Dot, Canker, Mummification, and Rust. Pakistan is the source of the images.
    (Yogesh Suryawanshi et al., 2022) An image collection consists of four vegetables:
    “Bell Pepper”, “Tomato”, “Chili Pepper”, and “New Mexico Chile”. The five distinct
    substructure classes in each vegetable collection are Ripe, Old, Dried, and Wounded.
    (Natnael Tilahun, 2022) This image collection was gathered from a potato farm
    in Holeta, Ethiopia to help in the detection of potato leaf disease. The aforementioned
    collection comprises two distinct varieties of photos. Both “Healthy” and “Late
    Blight” have 363 and 63 images, respectively. The potato disease issue can be
    resolved with this dataset. 8. Comprehensive shortcomings of PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS
    As discussed above in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application, some shortcomings have been addressed from the existing
    work on IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems. Individually, these gaps are identified
    according to the various farming activities. The gaps that are noticeable for
    PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS are discussed in the Table 4 from which it can be analysed
    that smart agriculture is a broad research area and the developed existing IoT-enabled
    system still has shortcomings in terms of standard protocols, inconsistencies
    in collected data, and inconsistencies of IoT devices (such as there are multiple
    temperature sensors but their data formats are different and also it is difficult
    to interface that sensor with multiple subsystem microcontroller because of the
    varying platform), difficult to integrate existing system to multiple regions
    because of the environmental factor, cost, lack of technologies enhancement of
    the system and endorsement with real-time information with external source information.
    As from sections, 2, 3, 4 and 5 it can be extrapolated that more examination needs
    to be performed to accomplish IoT-based solutions for the SSL, SGM, SDG, PDT,
    affected crop sorting, CWM, and FDP. Research can be conducted on different crop
    types location-wise. IoT data security is a significant uncertainty, so there
    is a need for scalable WSN or robust mechanisms to protect data. Table 4. In depth
    shortcomings analysis of the existing smart agriculture system based on PHRS,
    DHRS and POHRS. PHRS Problems Focused Description Inconsistency with Standards
    Security protocols, device compatibility, and firmware still need to be standardized
    for IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM, SSL, SGM, DFM, WPM, and SDG systems. Compared to
    other methods and outcomes, the existing systems are difficult to compare. Standardized
    procedures and frameworks are necessary for assessing and comparing different
    methods. Limited Data analysis IoT is dependent on the volume of data. Most of
    the time that information is not easily accessible because of non-availability
    of open source data. More trustworthy sensor data and adequate data-gathering
    techniques are required because still depended on external source data. Data should
    be location-wise, all types of data, and should be validated with real-time and
    existing data. There is need for advanced data analytics techniques to make sense
    of these vast generated data. Inadequate scalability For IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM,
    DFM, and WPM applications, there are many active research projects; nevertheless,
    there is still work to be done to scale this system for commercial applications.
    SGM, SSL and SD-based IoT-based systems require more research. This system are
    not fully automated. Inadequate knowledge Performing experiments on the crop relies
    on understanding of the crop physiology as well as a range of environmental factors,
    which is yet not fully understood. More study is needed on the physiological processes
    of various crops, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on crop growth
    and development. Inability to integrate with current agricultural systems To make
    the fully IoT-based pre-harvesting method more effective, the system can be incorporated
    with the existing agricultural systems such as smart crop recommendation system
    based on weather, location, seed selection and soil nutrients analysis, smart
    soil digging, etc. There is a lack of research in this area of integration. The
    study has to be performed to discover the potential benefits and drawbacks of
    the integration. Limited Accuracy Currently, most IoT devices lead to erroneous
    and inconsistent data, as they have limitations in terms of accuracy, reliability,
    and precision. In addition, sensor calibration is also important despite being
    complex and time-consuming and can result in inconsistent results if not done.
    Also, these devices have to place optimally to ensure correct data collection,
    which can be further used for analysis. The study has to be performed to make
    a system accurate and reliable. Cost Effective IoT-based systems can be expensive
    to install and maintain and thus can be a barrier while adopting the technique,
    especially for small-scale farmers. Although the cost of devices has decreased
    in recent years, the overall integration can still lead to a higher cost. Research
    has to be focused to investigate cost-effective solutions. Use of MCLRN approaches
    The present work has used MCLRN techniques in IoT-based systems, however due to
    the overfitting issue, the trained MCLRN model still cannot make an accurate forecast.
    DHRS Multi-technology incorporating IoT makes it possible for the system to apply
    a variety of technologies during the harvesting process. These technologies can
    be combined to create a system, but research is needed to determine the best way
    to do so. According to the study of the current work, several systems have not
    been fully incorporated. Such as SIR with SHMFM, PCN, PDT, WDT, CLO etc. System
    for Enhancing Irrigation Research must be conducted to point out the efficient
    way to irrigate the plants as compared to the traditional methods of irrigation.
    Such as irrigation system should be managed automatically on behalf of different
    of types crops. Acquiring and adopting users Existing IoT-based DHRS systems are
    still mishandled and challenging to adopt in various environments. Research must
    be performed to make a system that can be easily handled and adopted by end users
    in different environments. Soil health The DHRS process includes IoT enabled system
    for crop monitoring and SHMFM. Research must be performed to examine how SIR affects
    soil systems, microbial residents, and nutrient process for various crops. Environment''s
    impact Still, research is to be investigated based on environmental factors such
    as calibration of temperature, humidity, and rainfall during SHMFM and DDAN. Privacy
    and Security As far as the security of IoT-based DHR systems is concerned, very
    little research has been conducted. Detecting the diseases accurately Although
    IoT-based systems can provide real-time plant health data, there are still limitations
    to how precise the data is. Various factors affect accuracy and research must
    be done to monitor those factors, which can impact accuracy. Efficient Energy
    Continuous data collection is difficult in remote regions. A cost-effective, self-sustaining,
    and optimised technique should be implemented in the current IoT-based systems
    for PDT, DDAN, SHMFM, and WDT so that field monitoring data can be gathered continually.
    Analysing pest behaviour The system to detect pests accurately still needs improvement.
    As various pests respond differently in different environments. Optimization of
    Object Detection algorithms Need more research in the areas of IoT-enabled systems
    for WDT, PDT, CLO, and PCN to provide optimized solutions for accurate results.
    So system performance can be increased. POHRS Security and Privacy While most
    harvesting data must be stored properly and securely. Various IoT-based systems
    can be implemented to monitor and store the data. In this era of cyber threats,
    the system must be made in such a way to make the data properly stored, thus making
    it secure. Innovative solutions with a low cost Developing IoT enables cost-effective
    solutions in post-harvest activities is challenging based on security and privacy.
    As in POHRS, there are still some shortcomings in the existing system, which needed
    to be addressed. Such as in RSCS, SWM, and TTN there is still lacking data security,
    data storage, and low-cost automated system of fruits and vegetables monitoring.
    Research must be done to deeply understand such a situation and make a cost-efficient
    system so that it can be used by small-scale farmers also. Miniature studies In
    POHRS most of the ongoing work is focused on TTN, RSCS, and CWM but missing this
    existing system on a large scale for post-harvest phases. In the current automated
    RSCS system, the sorting technique management can be improved by including scheduling
    and weightage systems for post-harvest storage of crops during the TTN process,
    because Indian farmers have fewer low-cost smart facilities. Research can be done
    to investigate the effectiveness of the IoT system on a large scale as well. Incorporating
    multiple methods IoT system integrates different components which are somehow
    correlated to each other. Research should be carried out to determine how those
    components must be integrated as a distributed system that develops a self-sustainable
    and cost-efficient system. Availability and Reliability The IoT-based system should
    be readily available for the end users. Research should be done regarding the
    improvements in the availability of the data during TTN as well as while RSCS,
    utilizing real-time monitoring. 9. Proposed architecture for smart agriculture
    From PHRS to POHRS, a number of existing smart methodologies have been established
    for all different types of farming tasks, and they are all covered above along
    with their benefits as well as their drawbacks. By using the proposed architecture
    the limitations of the present structures can be reduced in light of the discussion
    above. A compact sensor network is made possible. Thanks to the integration of
    IoT, MCLRN, metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, AI, edge computing, cloud computing,
    SDN, cryptography for data security, UAVs, etc. Using 5G (gNB architecture) and
    5G beyond networks (Abdulghaffar et al., 2021), the recommended IoT-facilitated
    smart farming architecture is designed on the basis of IoT layered architecture
    in the Fig. 11. The sensor layer consists of different types of sensors, and data
    transmitters (“sx1276”, “nrf24l01”, etc.), cameras, high-frequency navigation
    (GPS), etc. It acts to collect and transmit facts it to the central server utilizing
    a 5G network connectivity via an edge gateway for data processing and analytics.
    The central server gives the farmers useful information using miscellaneous algorithms
    and standard procedures. These details may be on the choice of crop, seed germination,
    irrigation, soil analysis, and status, livestock status, crop diseases detection,
    crop sorting and storage, tracking, etc. The collected data are about the PHRS
    subsystem, DHRS subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. These subsystems are interconnected
    to each other to make the overall agriculture system automated. So that farmers
    can optimize their farming procedures and enhance crop yields. Under this system,
    the automated actuators can be used to enable farmers to remotely control some
    of the devices such as irrigation motors, pest control, soil digging, etc. Layer
    by layer, smart agriculture can be developed as follows: Download : Download high-res
    image (896KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Proposed 5G based Smart
    Agriculture Framework. 9.1. Perception layer In this layer, multiple sensor networks
    can be created by deploying various sensor nodes for the PHRS subsystem, DHRS
    subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. This subsystem is communicated to each other as
    machine-to-machine communication (Sakthivel and Vidhya, 2021) and connected to
    an each 5GIoT base edge gateway. The PHRS subsystem retrieves the data of various
    environmental factors, including water in the soil, fertiliser, temperature, and
    humidity, sunlight, flood and drought-related, etc, and transmits this data to
    the local IoT edge gateway for further computation and analysis. The DHRS subsystem
    consists of the sensor data of irrigation, NPK, pest controlling, weed detection,
    disease prediction, livestock, insects sound, crop field, etc. This data is also
    transmitted to a local IoT edge gateway and the same as POHRS sensor network data
    will be collected and transmitted to its IoT local edge gateway for further computing
    and analysis. This all subsystems are the backbone of the IoT sensor network.
    9.2. Network layer The entire IoT AGRI subsystem is designed based on the 5G network,
    but it can enable 5G beyond the network as needed. Essentially, a 5G core network
    is a high-level network that is made up of a radio access network and one or more
    edge networks. The 5G base stations are connected to open flow switches which
    are known as gNB switches (edge network). For traffic offloading and “quality
    of service (QoS)” implementation, SDN controllers can interface with base stations
    using the open flow protocol. The “protocol data unit (PDU) session” or “user
    plane function (UPF)” is used in the core network to connect the data network
    (DN). The SDN controller controls all gNB, UPF, and data plane switches. This
    layer is responsible for all transmissions and communications between sensors,
    IoT gateways, and cloud servers. 9.3. Cloud layer The network layer''s via SDN
    controller would transport the sensor data acquired from the perception layer
    to the cloud layer platform, where analytics would be carried out utilising tools
    like AI, MCLRN, Weka, and Hadoop, among others. Cloud platforms include “AWS”,
    “Azure”, “IBM Cloud”, etc. To handle and analyse the data gathered from the sensors,
    this cloud service offers storage and computational capabilities. The designed
    API gateway is used to manage communication between the edge gateway and the cloud
    server while utilising all authentication services. 9.4. Application layer The
    insights produced by the cloud server will be available to the end user through
    mobile applications, web applications, etc., including farmers, stack holders,
    suppliers, ranchers, purchasers, etc. So that farmers may make informed judgements,
    this programme gives them real-time information regarding the PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS. 9.5. Data storage and processing layer Depending on the particular applications
    and the volume of data collected, the data storage needs for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems can change. Numerous services, including data source, data
    processing, decision support, transmission system, authorization, storage space,
    and reliability, are offered in the data storage and processing layer. The digital
    footprint of the data collection and storing for the IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems in smart agriculture is shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download
    high-res image (611KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Data processing
    and storage footprint. Data gathering: Obtaining information from numerous agricultural
    fields (F) using a variety of sensors, including those that measure things like
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil ph, soil NPK, air pressure, RFID, rodents,
    insects, and other animals, as well as things like plant color recognition, rainfall,
    disease detection, and recognization through cameras, storage and cooling control
    of harvested vegetables or fruits, transportation and tracking, water flow measurement,
    level, and pump control. This sensor and actuator data is sent to the server for
    analysis and decision-making for the farm fields, or real-time monitoring. Depending
    on the sensor type and frequency, a single sensor node may generate data on average
    in the range of KB to a megabyte (MB) each day. The expected data storage, for
    instance, can range from GB to terabytes (TB) per year if there is a vast farming
    area with numerous sensors. In addition, image and video data are gathered from
    drones to monitor crop health, pest detection, weed detection, and crop yield.
    This data contains high-definition images of farms in 5 to 100 MB sizes. It is
    possible to estimate total storage capacity by estimating the frequency of capturing
    such imaginary data. The sensor data for CYP, CSL, SGM, STM, SDG, SIR, RSCS, CWM,
    DDAN, PDT, CLO, WDT, SHMFM TTN, and FDP systems as well as scheduling irrigation,
    measuring insect control effectiveness, managing livestock, keeping track of crop
    yields, and managing agribusiness depend on the overall dimension of the farm,
    the variety of crops grown there, and the amount of detail that can be gathered.
    For each crop every year, this data size can be in the KB to MB range. However,
    WPM generates climate-related data that can be recorded for historical research
    and transmitted in KB each hour or day. Data pre-processing: In the pre-processing,
    the gathered data are prepared for further analysis. Which is used to fill in
    the missing data, remove the redundant data, format the data into its size, type,
    and classes, and normalize the data to make data more reliable and knowledgeable.
    Data repository: The local storage server, which may be a NoSql, time-series,
    or relational database, stores all pre-process data. It is quite difficult to
    make the data more trustworthy and long-lasting because the database storage can
    come from a variety of sources of different types and sizes. The data is cleaned
    using a variety of pre-processing techniques throughout the pre-process. There
    are different, specialised cleaning techniques for text and picture data, such
    as stemming and lemmatization, as well as image geometric conversions, image filtering,
    segmentation, Fourier transform, and image restoration, among others. Data from
    both the past and the present is kept in the storage repository. In the edge computing
    layer, data transmission management is carried out between this data processing
    layer. The interval between acquisition and utilisation might vary extensively,
    ranging from a couple of seconds, minutes, or hours to a few weeks, or possibly
    a full year in extreme circumstances. Therefore, several transmission techniques
    can be used for quick and secure long-distance transmission via wired or wireless
    means. High-speed data connection, such as a 5G communication network, is also
    necessary. Various data flow control techniques, including stop and wait, feedback
    control, sliding windows, two-directional communications, etc., will be used to
    manage the data communication traffic between these two communications. Throughout
    all of these steps, data analyses are carried out utilising different MCLRN and
    AI algorithms to send actions and notifications to the user''s cloud server. A
    suggested approach for smart farming system data footprint is developed based
    on smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS existing work deficiencies using a 5G data communication
    network. For the storage of this PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the maximum
    average data volume analysis is shown as a graph in Fig. 13. The regular data
    volume analysis is estimated in Fig. 13 as a graph based on the communication
    technologies range, periodicity of the sensor devices, camera resolution, data
    bandwidth, etc. Using different types of agricultural activity properties, this
    average data volume utilisation analysis over the past 30 days has been calculated.
    The analysis of the 30-day total average data volume was calculated at 1.38856
    GB. Depending on the particular PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the data transfer
    frequency changes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Estimated digital footprint for one month of proposed
    PHRS,DHRS and POHRS Systems. For instance, a system used to track soil temperature
    and nutrient content might release information once each hour or day. Meanwhile,
    a different system will deliver data every minute for crop growth assessment.
    As more smart sensors are deployed and technology is developed, the amount of
    data conveyed for different crops in soil and crop growth monitoring will expand
    in the future. Aspects that can increase the volume of data include the number
    of sensors used, the type of data (image, text, or numerical), frequency, distance,
    time, cost of data transmission, size of the farmed area, crop type, climate,
    irrigation method, soil type, disease type, etc. 10. Comparative analysis of existing
    smart agriculture system with proposed 5G based architecture For the recommendation
    of a 5G-based smart agriculture framework, some of the existing available research
    surveys have already (Liu et al., 2023) been carried out, in which the major technologies
    and technological barriers preventing the advancement and development of smart
    agriculture applications leveraging 5G technologies are described. The resultant
    effect of 5G on the IoT for smart agriculture is outlined. An exploration of precision
    agricultural (Majumdar et al., 2023) applications has been explored using green
    IoT-based solutions, utilizing UAVs, LPWANs, and 5G networks as well as an assortment
    of technical issues. Utilizing 5G networks and beyond, the long-lasting expansion
    of digital farming through the incorporation of green IoT technology enables the
    IoT greener. The proposed architecture above has been recommended by incorporating
    each multiple-edge gateway grid with the central controller for all small and
    large farming area data based on the existing 5G-based smart agriculture architecture.
    The advantages of using this agriculture system over existing IoT-based agriculture
    systems include the immediately apparent advancement across multiple agriculture
    applications, centralised archives of data, estimation process power, etc. Existing
    smart agriculture exhibits challenging obstacles and demands to handle high volume
    data storing processes, computation power, and managing various agriculture applications
    of small and large farming areas. Therefore, in this instance, data computation,
    interpreting, and other capabilities can be offered close to the network''s edge,
    where initially the data are originated. Edge computing power has benefits such
    as decreased latency, bandwidth savings, reduced downtime, increased trustworthiness,
    improved privacy and security, etc. The proposed IoT-based architecture allows
    for the best provisioning of resources using SDN, network segmentation, route
    optimisation, load balancing, and other practises. A evaluation of current smart
    farm systems with the proposed IoT architecture is shown in Table 5 below based
    on the various parameter. Some of the characteristics are identical in the proposed
    5G-based smart agriculture architecture and the existing smart agriculture architecture.
    The comparison has been verified based on this characteristic. Table 5. Advantages
    of the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system with existing smart agriculture
    system. Comparative parameter (Udutalapally et al., 2021) (Liu et al., 2023) Proposed
    5G based IoT agriculture architecture system Bandwidth Low Bandwidth Fast bandwidth
    with single edge network Fast bandwidth with single and multiple edge network
    with LPWAN communication Latency High latency rate and risk of data loss during
    cloud transmission. Delay time will be increased for large farming area. Delay
    time is reduced as of using multiple edge gateway. Interruption Interruption rate
    are high Interruption rate can be high if switching to 5G beyond network or multiple
    edge network. Interruption are reduced because authenticated edge connection for
    small and large farming field WSN and can be customized based on the network.
    Data storage Limited storage capacity and complicated database management because
    of limited globalization. High storage capacity at the cloud end, as the architecture
    is for small farming area. Capable of managing databases at the edge network and
    storage capacity will be maximum as using distributed system. Energy efficient
    Requires a lot of energy for calculation and processing while transmitting various
    types of data at long distances. More energy required as system is not fully distributed.
    Less energy consumption as system is distributed. Minimises the necessity for
    transmission of data over long distances. Real time decision Real-time decision-making
    can be accomplished although has a larger latency, which restricts its effectiveness
    for circumstances where timeliness is essential. Real time decision possible but
    lack in independency at each edge network. Increase productivity and yield by
    enabling real-time decision-making with exposure to the constantly changing conditions
    on the farm. PHRS Subsystems Integration of PHRS sub systems is possible with
    other farming sub system but need much enhancement, as limited range of network
    connections and no such algorithm for intelligent decision making at the edge
    level. Since PHRS module data differ from farm to farm, there are chances of data
    overload at the edge network level because there are no such discussions on NP-hard
    problem optimization strategies. Using of metaheuristic-based algorithms it is
    possible to increase the efficiency of PHRS, sub-systems in 5G-based or beyond
    networks. DHRS Subsystems Integration of DHRS sub-systems is limited as it provides
    a huge volume of image and video-type data. Integration of the DHRS subsystem
    is achievable as discussed about the UAVs-based system for various image vision
    problems. Integration of DHRS with PHRS subsystem is achievable using NB-IoT M2M
    communication. POHRS Subsystems Integration of POHRS subsystem is limited. POHRS
    subsystem integration for supply chain management. Management of POHRS subsystems
    for TTN, FDP, cooling, harvesting, and farmers'' inventory. Security and privacy
    Device security, data authentication, network slicing, and encryption still need
    to be improved. There is no analogous method discussed for recognising security
    ambiguity while deploying IoT devices for securing inconsistent energy-efficient
    communication devices for considerable distance and durability. The system becomes
    more efficient and capable with the help of 5G, SDN, and distributed edge computing
    structures and is able to oversee massive amounts of network traffic and data
    authentication. As a result of the discussion in Table 5 above, it can be concluded
    that creating the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system using edge computing
    could effortlessly extend to meet the increasing necessities of modern farming.
    The entire structure can be customized by how the agricultural operation grows
    and network changes or whether its operations require more sensors and devices.

    level. 5G Proposed Survey ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ According to Table 6, the proposed review fills
    the gap in existing reviews for IoT-based smart agriculture by classifying pre-
    and post-harvest activities into PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Based on this
    categorization, various existing work has been discussed in detail with an analysis
    of the IoT communication technologies and metaheuristic approach used in the IoT
    based smart agriculture system. As a result of the discussion of the problem in
    existing work, the 5G and 5G beyond smart agriculture system architecture are
    being prepared. With this recommended framework, the shortcomings of the existing
    work can be reduced, and the system can be optimized. 11. Conclusion IoT-based
    smart agriculture is the advancement of the digital transformation of various
    traditional farming subactivities. In this a comprehensive review by categorizing
    the farming subactivities based on the Pre, During, and Post harvests of the smart
    agriculture-based existing application has been discussed in detail. We have also
    observed the research gaps for each and every activity separately. Based on these
    research gaps it has been analyzed that developing an intelligent farming system
    is still a challenging process. We have tried to address these challenges and
    enhance the performance of the existing systems by proposing a 5G-based hybrid
    framework for smart agriculture. The outcome of the proposed survey is validated
    by comparison with the existing survey papers. It is found that various existing
    surveys have not been represented considering the smart agriculture applications
    according to the Pre, During, and Post harvesting phases. Therefore, our survey
    methodology and outcome seem to outperform the other surveys conducted so far
    for smart agriculture. In future work the technology wise survey for the different
    aspects of smart agriculture may be conducted. For example, we can have a comprehensive
    survey on the use of Machine learning algorithms for each activity of smart agriculture.
    Also crop wise comprehensive survey can be conducted involving all the pre, during
    and post-harvest activities. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

  description: 'Purpose: The main focus is to concisely cover contemporary methods
    of IoT-oriented agriculture automation using weather monitoring. In this article,
    IoT components, communication protocols, data analysis and prediction methods

    4.0 are discussed to outline challenges for researchers to adjust irrigation schedules
    as per non-linear weather changes for developing an economically viable, real-time

    processing and storage are extensively surveyed. Besides, we also reviewed how
    these approaches are enhanced using Agriculture 4.0 for different crops. Results:
    Extensive survey reveals shortcomings of existing approaches and shows that temperature
    and humidity are most commonly monitored in IoT technologies. Cost analysis shows
    minimum cost incurred for hardware is 1–10$ for machine learning and edge computing

    communication 1. Introduction Crops are essential for human life because they
    provide food, animal feed, fuel, and raw materials for clothing and shelter. Crop
    yield has to be doubled in 2050 compared to 2009 in order to meet the demand of
    a growing population while increasing the food quality and reducing production
    inputs (Fukase and Martin, 2020). Potential solutions to enhance global food security
    include closing crop yield gaps, reducing food waste, changing dietary habits,
    and reducing inefficiencies in resource use (Foley et al., 2011). Reducing inefficiencies
    in input resources (such as water and nitrogen) can be achieved by continuously
    monitoring crops, soil, and microclimate, and then properly controlling inputs
    without sacrificing the yield and quality of the crop. Internet of Things (IoT)
    becomes a key technology that enables continuous monitoring and control in this
    scenario. The ability to generate (near) real-time quantitative data with high
    spatiotemporal resolution is a major advantage of IoT systems (Liao et al., 2017).
    IoTs are considered big data systems due to volumes, velocities, and varieties
    of data they generate. These data are mined and modeled to elucidate the relationships
    between inputs and outputs (Tsai et al., 2014). Correlation, trend analysis, classification,
    and numerical prediction are implemented on the data to reach meaningful control
    decisions. Compared with the conventional wireless sensor networks, the holistic
    approach of IoT technology allows users to incorporate data analytics on the big
    data collected by IoT sensor devices. Generally, connected actuators are enabled
    to control the inputs to achieve desired application rates. For example, an internet-connected
    soil water content (SWC) sensor network measures the plant water deficit and uploads
    data to a cloud-based data analysis platform. The analysis will find the trend
    of soil water deficit to determine the best time and quantity to apply irrigation
    water. There has been a boom in IoT application development in agriculture (Ag-IoT)
    in the last two decades, particularly around crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.
    However, the application of Ag-IoT at the commercial scale is still at its early
    stages. A deeper and more holistic understanding of the existing IoT system development
    is important for various stakeholders to sketch the future landscape of Ag-IoT.
    Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the key components of
    Ag-IoT including sensors, actuators, data processing, and data transmission, summarize
    its usage in crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring, and identify the research
    needs for successful IoT implementation in the future. Though Ag-IoT is proliferating
    in both crop and animal monitoring and management, Ag-IoT for crop production
    is the focus of this paper. IoT platforms for livestock production, as well as
    other sectors of agriculture (such as postharvest) are not included. IoT can be
    found in the manufacturing industry, consumers products, retail, finance and marketing,
    healthcare, transportation and logistics, smart city, military applications and
    supply chains (Islam et al., 2022). Fig. 1 shows the three main layers of a generic
    IoT architecture: the perception layer, network layer, and application layer (Jabraeil
    Jamali et al., 2020). The perception layer consists of gateways, mobile devices,
    sensors, actuators, power, and energy storage components. Activities in the perception
    layer include sensing, controlling, actuation, energy harvesting, energy storage,
    data transmission, and power management. The perception layer of the Ag-IoT faces
    challenges including harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneity of the applications,
    nonavailability of communication infrastructure, and lack of continuous power
    supplies, to just mention a few. This review therefore emphasizes the perception
    layer of Ag-IoT. The network layer consists of network devices and data transmission
    and processing functions. The application layer is responsible for user-specific
    applications such as data visualization, actuator control dashboards, as well
    as data storage, analysis, and decision making. This three-layer architecture
    of IoT can be expanded to five layers by including transport layer after network
    layer and adding business layer after the application layer (Banu, 2018). The
    transport layer is responsible for data transmission while the business layer
    manages the whole IoT system according to the user''s business model. Download

    Three- and five-layer architectures of generic IoT systems. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The method of the literature review is presented in Section
    two. Section three details the major elements of Ag-IoT technology. Section four
    describes the challenges that Ag-IoT systems face with emerging solutions. In
    Section five, supporting technologies for Ag-IoT are discussed. How the information
    from Ag-IoT can benefit farm systems analysis and management is discussed in Section
    six. The final section concludes the review article with future research directions.
    2. Review methodology We have come up with a list of eleven research questions
    to guide the literature review and analysis in Ag-IoT. These questions, along
    with the motivation to ask these questions and our initial hypotheses, are listed

    Ag-IoT systems are more popular with perennial crops To find the answers to questions
    in Table 1, a thorough literature review was conducted. The main approach was
    to find the answers based on the recent research carried out in the field of Ag-IoT.
    We have searched for the recent Ag-IoT research published in scientific journals
    and conference proceedings between 2011 and 2021, using keywords through Google
    Scholar and Scopus web search. Keywords used in the search were Internet of Things,
    IoT, Crop Monitoring, Wireless Sensor Network, Smart Agriculture, and Crop Sensing.
    This search resulted in 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings
    papers. After reading the abstracts, 115 papers were determined to be relevant
    to the topic of Ag-IoT. The selected articles are listed in the Appendix, and
    they were used for in-depth analysis. Research papers selected covered countries
    in all six continents (except for Antarctica, Fig. 2a). Asia presented the largest
    number of papers (Scotford and Miller, 2004), whereas Australia had the smallest
    number of papers. In terms of countries, India (Coleman et al., 2022) and China
    (Chen et al., 2014) had the highest numbers of research outcomes. Fig. 2b presented
    the yearly distribution of the research papers. The number of research papers
    published related to the topic increased over time, with the highest in 2019.
    Demographics of the collected data set provided the answer to question 1 in Table
    1, that Ag-IoT has received global attention. More Ag-IoT research has been completed
    in countries with smallholder farmers such as India and China. The selected papers
    were read carefully and analyzed for the technical specification of the IoT systems,
    including the sensors and actuators in each study, communication technologies
    used, environment the system implemented, and the IoT service provider used. Download

    In Section 3, we have thoroughly reviewed the major components of Ag-IoT. To conduct
    this review systematically, we have divided this section into multiple subsections.
    These subsections are sensors, IoT platforms/main control board, wireless communication
    technology, IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and energy management, and actuators.
    3.1. Sensors Sensors play a major role in Ag-IoT systems because they serve as
    the converter between real-world signals and their digital representations. This
    section begins with an introduction and categorization of sensors used to measure
    crop, soil, and microclimate parameters. General purpose sensors such as temperature
    sensor, light intensity sensor, accelerometers, soil moisture sensor, etc., can
    be integrated into Ag-IoT systems (White, 1987). Table 2 gives sensor categories
    along with sensor measurands and provides some examples found in the literature.

    et al., 2017) Proper selection of sensors to an application is essential for IoT
    systems developers as well as for users to best use the sensors. The advancement
    of sensor technologies has a major impact on the popularity of IoT. Low energy
    consumption, compatibility in data transmission between the microcontroller and
    the sensor, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and robustness are major considerations
    to select a sensor for IoT system development. To address research question 2
    in Table 1, we marked and counted the sensors in the 115 research papers reviewed,
    with the total count of each sensor given in Fig. 3. Soil moisture sensors were
    used for the largest number of applications (Ivanova et al., 2016) followed by
    humidity sensors (Hurst et al., 2021) and then air temperature sensors (Haque
    et al., 2021). The reason these sensors were integrated most in Ag-IoT so far
    is likely because of the need for continuous in-situ soil moisture monitoring
    for decision making in irrigated agricultural production. Water scarcity is a
    global issue, and the amount of arable land can be expanded significantly if growers
    can apply water efficiently (Aroca et al., 2018). On the contrary, soil water
    tension measured via soil water potential sensors only appeared in three papers.
    This lower interest in soil water potential sensors is likely due to (1) less
    understanding of the relationship between soil water tension and crop growth,
    (2) less availability of low-cost soil water potential sensors, and (3) the difficulty
    in interfacing the available soil water potential sensors to the IoT platforms.
    Next, we will discuss the Ag-IoT sensors found in the literature according to
    the measurand category it belongs to. Download : Download high-res image (192KB)

    research papers and their frequency. 3.1.1. Acoustic sensors Ultrasound distance
    measurement sensors and microphones are the most common acoustic property measuring
    sensors. Direct use of acoustic measurements is limited in Ag-IoT. Hardwood borer
    identification IoT sensor network is a direct application of microphone used in
    pest detection in forestry (Potamitis et al., 2019). Ultrasonic wind speed and
    direction sensor is an important meteorological sensor used in agriculture to
    estimate evapotranspiration (Kameoka et al., 2017). Compared with the mechanical
    anemometer, an ultrasonic anemometer requires less maintenance due to fewer mechanical
    parts involved. Furthermore, an ultrasonic anemometer can capture sudden changes
    in wind speed and direction very accurately. Acoustic sensors were used indirectly
    to measure biological measurands. Crop canopy height estimation by ultrasound
    sensor is an indirect approach to measure biological parameters (Yuan et al.,
    2018; Elci et al., 2018). IoT-enabled ultrasound distance sensors are widely used
    in irrigation systems to estimate the water volume in tanks, wells and reservoirs,
    and it is an essential sensor for irrigation scheduling in automated irrigation
    systems. Recently ultrasound flow meters replaced the mechanical flow meters due
    to their high accuracy in flow rate measurement with less maintenance. Underwater
    ultrasound scanning is possible for aquatic plant growth monitoring purposes such
    as lotas and seaweed and has a huge potential to determine the harvest stage and
    growth rate monitoring (Kool and Bernard, 2019). Fruit ripeness estimation is
    an interesting example of the indirect use of acoustics in agriculture. Daosawang
    et al. (2020) demonstrated that watermelon ripeness could be estimated by a sound
    generator and receiver. In summary, acoustic sensors advanced in recent years
    while replacing some traditional mechanical Ag-sensors and introducing new applications
    in agriculture. 3.1.2. Biological sensors Above-ground biomass of plant, plant
    height, plant density, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI), count of plant organs
    (leaf, fruit, flower), chlorophyll concentration, sap flow, and stomata conductance
    are useful biological parameters in crop monitoring. Crop yield and the growth
    stage can be estimated from the plant''s mass (biomass). Loadcells are used in
    indoor farming pots to measure the plant weight directly (Long and McCallum, 2015).
    Almost all the field crop biomass estimations have been measured by indirect sensing
    techniques such as biomass-sensitive vegetation indices (VI) or by image processing-based
    techniques. However, both techniques require time-consuming ground truth data
    collection for model calibration. The accuracy of these techniques is subject
    to lighting conditions, sensor type, crop type, model parameters, and training
    data set. Just like crop biomass, many other biological measurands are also estimated
    indirectly. For example, stomata conductance can be quantified through optical
    measurands, and plant height through acoustic sensors. Therefore, most of the
    biological measurands will be discussed as indirect applications under other measurands.
    3.1.3. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors can be categorized into two main types:
    photochemical and electrochemical. Photochemical sensors measure chemical reactions
    or chemicals by their spectral signature, and electrochemical sensors measure
    the electrical properties due to chemical reactions or the presence of chemicals
    (Angkawinitwong and Williams, 2021). Soil pH, soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen
    (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), pH and conductivity of irrigation water,
    and photosynthesis are the parameters that often measured by chemical sensors.
    Knowing the pH of water and soil is important because pH affects the solubility
    of nutrients and therefore plant nutrient uptake and growth. Soil and irrigation
    water pH measurements with IoT-enabled sensors were demonstrated in the literature
    in nine studies. Spatial variability and the dependency of sensor accuracy on
    soil condition are the issues to address to promote them in agriculture (Chen
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). The soil salinity sensor and custom-made nitrate
    sensor were counted only once, which highlighted the difficulty of measuring soil
    chemical properties continuously and in a non-destructive manner. The measurement
    of the real-time nutrient content in the soil, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K) are essential for fertigation. These sensors are still
    at the rudimentary stage (Burton et al., 2018) of development. Real-time soil
    nutrient sensing has a huge potential in future agriculture as nutrient leaching
    and groundwater pollution are serious issues people are facing now. Nitrate sensors
    can be fixed to groundwater pumps to monitor the nitrate status of groundwater,
    or installed in leaching water collectors in fields to get reasonable estimation
    about nitrate leaching (Hooper et al., 2019). Soil salinity can be derived from
    the soil''s electrical conductivity (EC), and it was demonstrated three times
    in the literature. This is a very important parameter to measure as soil salinity
    is one of the main soil degrading factors in irrigated agriculture. None of the
    research in the literature highlighted the importance of using EC sensors in soil
    or irrigation systems to ameliorate the soil salinity build-up due to irrigation.
    CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases attributed to climate change and agriculture
    is considered a major source of their emission. Accounting for the sourcing and
    sinking of CO2 and CH4 from soil and crops is important to understand the budget
    of greenhouse gases in agriculture. Research suggested that elevation of CO2 can
    increase crop yield as well as improve water use efficiency (Hatfield et al.,
    2011). Therefore, it is essential to measure CO2 and CH4. There are two types
    of gas sensors available. Metal oxide gas sensors increase the electric resistance
    of the sensor when it contacts certain gas. Optical gas sensors measure the absorption
    spectra to detect spectral signatures unique to the gas. O2 sensors can be used
    to monitor the crop respiration rate. Electrochemical sensors can be used to estimate
    dissolved oxygen as the increased dissolved oxygen in water can improve the quality
    and the yield of the aquatic plants (Shi et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). Another
    interesting parameter to measure is stomatal conductance. Plant stomatal openings
    regulate the exchange of water vapor and CO2 between a leaf and the surrounding
    atmosphere. So far, no IoT-enabled sensor has been developed to measure this parameter
    even though handheld sensors are available (Lamour et al., 2022). Chemical sensors
    can be used to monitor the quality of fruits during harvesting. As an example,
    IoT-enabled Ethelene gas sensors have a huge potential to use in fruit production
    to identify the best time to initiate harvesting (Esser et al., 2012). Although
    chemical sensors improved rapidly in the past decade, applications developed based
    on them in agriculture are still at an early stage. More research is needed to
    incorporate these sensors with Ag-IoT. 3.1.4. Electric sensors Electric sensors
    play a key role in Ag-IoT as they have been used in many industries for a long
    period. The main principle is to measure the change of electrical properties due
    to physical or chemical changes in plants, soil, and the environment. Some electrical
    parameters are charge, current, potential difference, electric field, resistance
    (or conductance), capacitance, and inductance. Soil moisture sensors via IoT systems
    were the most tested sensor in the literature. As most of the agricultural lands
    face water shortages and climate change has heavily affected the water availability,
    most of the studies attempted to address this requirement. We found that electrical
    resistance, capacitance, and permittivity of bulk soils were used to estimate
    soil volumetric water content (VWC). Furthermore, soil water tension was measured
    by the electrical resistance of gypsum blocks. For better irrigation scheduling,
    both VWC and soil water tension are important: VWC quantifies the amount of water
    in the soil whereas soil water tension is a better indicator of how difficult
    plant roots can extract water from the soil matrix. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors are the other two dominant sensors researchers have tested. There are
    three types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive, and thermal. Crop ET and
    pest or disease forecasting are the potential applications of the air temperature
    and humidity sensing requirements. But 90% of the research just demonstrated the
    capability of plug play these sensors; only 10% of IoT researchers demonstrate
    the capability of using those sensors for a meaningful task like disease forecasting.
    Humidity is an important environmental parameter directly related to ET calculation,
    crop quality, and pest growth forecasting. Sensors can be deployed to measure
    absolute, relative, and specific humidity. For example, the best time to start
    grain harvesting is highly dependent on grain moisture content and if harvested
    without considering the optimal moisture level it may cause extensive post-harvesting
    damage and economic loss (Zoerb et al., 1993). IoT-based ET modeling and irrigation
    scheduling enable low water usage and low irrigation energy consumption. IoT also
    opened the path for non-conventional VWC measurement. Aroca et al. (2018) presented
    the use of RFID to estimate VWC with a received signal strength of the tag with
    R2 > 0.9. A rain sensor based on the electrical conductivity principle was demonstrated
    as an IoT sensor that could detect the start and end of the rain (Andrey Rivas-Sánchez
    et al., 2019). Based on these literature outcomes it can be concluded that electric
    sensors are mature compared to acoustic and chemical sensors and have been used
    in the industry for a long time and have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT.
    3.1.5. Mechanical sensors Mechanical sensors convert a physical parameter of interest
    through a mechanical system to an electrical signal. Parameters such as flow rate,
    acceleration, velocity, direction, orientation, and pressure can be measured by
    mechanical sensors. Examples of IoT-enabled mechanical sensors found in the literature
    include rain gauges, mechanical flow meters, air and liquid pressure meters, and
    anemometers. Rain gauge is important to capture the precipitation accurately to
    determine the timing and quantity of irrigation when combined with soil water
    content sensors and evapotranspiration modeling (Kameoka et al., 2017). Tipping
    bucket rain sensor converts water volume it captures to an electrical signal through
    a simple mechanism. Measuring pressure is important for air, liquid, and soil
    pressure calculation. Air pressure is relevant to measure crop transpiration as
    the opening and closing of plant stomata are partially regulated by vapor pressure
    deficit. Soil compaction can be measured by the pressure sensors inserted into
    the soil, which are useful for measuring the impact of heavy agricultural machinery.
    Irrigation line pressure sensors are critical to monitor the irrigation process
    as the wetting pattern of irrigation systems highly depends on the irrigation
    line pressure. High pressure causes loss of irrigation energy while low pressure
    does not allow maximum irrigation area through sprinklers. Anemometers can be
    used to measure the wind speed which is required for calculating ET and detecting
    high-speed wind that could be hazardous to plants. Gas and liquid flow rate are
    significant parameters for crop, soil, and environmental monitoring. Conventionally
    crop and soil inputs in the liquid or gaseous form, such as water input (including
    rain), leaching water, liquid fertilizer, liquid or gaseous insecticides, are
    measured using flow sensors. Some cash crops or niche crops such as wasabi (Sultana
    and Savage, 1970) and lettuce (Sultana and Savage, 1970) need highly precise environmental
    conditions and flow monitoring sensors are important for meeting those conditions
    in the future if climate change imposes challenges to grow them. Overall mechanical
    sensors play a key role in Ag-IoT systems, but most of the mechanical sensors
    are replaced by non-mechanical sensors due to the fact mechanical sensors need
    frequent maintenance and have long response time. 3.1.6. Optical sensors Optical
    measurands play a key role in modern agriculture. There should be a light source
    and an optical sensor to take the measurements. Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and
    near infrared (NIR) are the main wavelength regions where optical sensors are
    operated. It is important to note that optical sensors appear to have the least
    applications as IoT sensors according to the literature. Typical RGB images were
    used to derive RGB image-based vegetation indexes while multispectral sensors
    were used to derive vegetation indexes such as NDVI and NDRE (red-edge NDVI).
    Most of the optical sensors that generate spectral signatures or images of the
    target produce larger volumes of data and consume a higher amount of power compared
    to other sensors in Fig. 3. This appears to be a significant discouraging factor
    to incorporate these sensors into IoT. Naturally, signals in the visible region
    were used as indicators for many crops and environmental parameters such as maturation
    time, crop quality (Long and McCallum, 2015), crop nutrient requirement, pest
    pressure, as well as water and nutrient level in the soil. Historically people
    used their eyes (only responsive to the visible lights) to evaluate the color
    intensities somewhat qualitatively (e.g., comparing those to standard color cards).
    The introduction of these sensors has significantly improved optical measurements
    of crop and environmental parameters by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) enabling quantitative
    assessments and (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001) extending the spectral regions from
    visible only to UV and NIR. Fruit spectral signature was used to identify defects
    in the fruit that could not be revealed via visible light. NDVI and NDRE were
    used to quantitatively determine crop density as well as the nitrogen and water
    requirements (Scotford and Miller, 2004). We would like to highlight that more
    research is needed to demonstrate the optical measurand use in Ag-IoT as they
    can be used in a wide range of applications in agriculture. 3.1.7. Thermal sensors
    Thermal measurands have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT, and most of them
    are measured indirectly with optical and electrical means; for instance, measuring
    crop canopy temperature with infrared radiometers. In the literature, the frequent
    use of air and soil temperature sensors highlighted their importance in crop ET
    modeling and disease forecasting (Symeonaki et al., 2020). These sensors are cheap
    and readily available as off-the-shelf items and support a wide variety of IoT
    platforms (Mohanraj et al., 2016). Thermal parameters have the potential to indirectly
    measure biological measurands. One such example is the sap flow sensor, which
    was described in one study as a transpiration measuring sensor compatible with
    the IoT system (Villalba et al., 2017). The sensor consisted of a flexible tree
    stem heater and a temperature sensor while the IoT platform calculated sap flow
    based on the applied heat and temperature. This sap flow measurement is proportional
    to transpiration (sap movement in the xylem) and therefore useful in crop ET modeling
    (Villalba et al., 2017). Sap flow monitoring is essential in some crops to understand
    the physiological behavior of plants. Rubber, maple, coconut, and palmyra palm
    sap are the output of the harvest, and in these cases, sap flow monitoring is
    useful to estimate yield, optimize production, and develop high-yielding crop
    varieties. Indirectly measured canopy temperature through infrared radiometers
    estimates the transpiration rate and crop water stress index, which is important
    for water stress detection and irrigation scheduling (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001).
    Identification of pests such as wild boar through thermal measurement is an interesting
    application in agriculture. Furthermore, the temperature is found to affect the
    quality of grapefruits (sugar content) and flowering time of several crops (Pérez-Expósito
    et al., 2017). Temperature sensors can also record the temperature variation in
    plant leaves and flowering buds and give a warning about frosting time (Barker
    et al., 2017). This listing of thermal measurand applications concluded that thermal
    sensors are very important in Ag-IoT and have been demonstrated in the past literature.
    3.2. Sensing platforms and main control board Section 3.2 summarizes the statistics
    of the Ag-IoT sensing platforms and control boards in the literature. The answer
    for Question 3 in Table 1 was derived from Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (196KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main control boards
    of the Ag-IoT systems present in the reviewed papers. 3.2.1. Sensing platforms
    Sensing platforms consist of sensor node including sensors, power supply, energy
    storage, actuators, main control board or the data processing unit, and structural
    components. Structural components determine the sensor node establishment in the
    field. There are two main types of IoT platforms available for crop monitoring.
    Stationery IoT platforms can collect continuous crop data or telemetry data targeting
    a single plant or a group (plot) of plants. The main advantage of stationery IoT
    is the high temporal resolution of the data. Mobile IoT platforms can collect
    data over some areal coverage and with high spatial resolution, but with limited
    temporal resolution. Kumar et al. (2016) presented the development and testing
    of a crop monitoring mobile robot. It is capable of automatically planning the
    path to find crops, recognizing plants using neural networks, applying fertilizer
    timely, and applying water based on the feedback from soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and humidity sensors. 3.2.2. Main control boards The communication and
    data processing hardware for IoT systems reported in the reviewed papers could
    be broadly categorized into three kinds: commercial platforms, custom build, and
    DIY (do-it-yourself) development boards. The commercial platforms are reliable
    but have limited support for integrating different or additional sensors. IPex12
    (Odin Solutions SL, Peru), Particle Electron (Particle Industries, Inc., USA),
    MICAZ (MICAS AG, Germany), IRIS (IRIS IoT Solutions, UK), and Telosb (Advantic
    Sistemas y Servicios S.L., Spain) are commercial IoT systems. In the last decade,
    commercial IoT platforms were still at their development stage, explaining their
    lower use in the reviewed papers. Custom build hardware is designed by researchers
    based on their own requirements. Researchers have the flexibility to decide on
    the number and types of sensors, interfacing connections, microprocessor clock
    speed, IoT node memory capacity, input voltage, and the communication technology
    used in the node. Furthermore, the technical complexities present in developing
    customized sensor interfacing may also discourage researchers from using commercial
    systems. The custom build hardware platforms have high levels of customization
    but require extensive knowledge of embedded system development to design them.
    DIY platforms are IoT nodes designed based on commercially available development
    platforms, including Arduino, EasyPIC v7, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Wapmote. DIY
    development board based IoT systems are popular among researchers because of their
    low cost, high availability, compatibility, and easy programmability. The percentage
    of different hardware platforms used in the reviewed articles is given in Fig.
    4. There were 52 identifiable hardware designs in the list of 115 research. Out
    of them, 29% of the platforms had Arduino only, 8% had Arduino and Raspberry Pi
    hardware jointly, and 2% used Arduino and Arducam hardware together. Ag-IoT research
    was dominated by Arduino-based development systems. Availability, reliability,
    easy programmability, and the option of supporting multiple communication protocols
    made Arduino-based systems popular among Ag-IoT researchers. Raspberry Pi systems
    were demonstrated in 12% of the IoT systems, likely due to their capability of
    capturing images and high computing power compared to Arduino. Selection of the
    IoT platform and the main control board is an important activity in IoT system
    design. The mainboard must support the communication protocols and the power requirement
    (e.g., voltage) of the sensors and actuators. Often voltage and communications
    protocol converters are needed to interface sensors with the main control board.
    Mainboards support three types of digital memories. Volatile memory holds the
    instructions and data of the currently running program until the power is on.
    Volatile memory influences the system''s performance. A larger volatile memory
    is needed for IoT nodes with a large amount of data generated via sensors like
    RGB cameras or spectral sensors. Nonvolatile memory stores data and the program
    when the IoT node power is turned off. The operating system, device identification
    data, and system settings are common data types stored in the nonvolatile memory.
    External nonvolatile memory (e.g., SD cards) can be used to store data or system
    settings, greatly expanding the data storage capability of the Ag-IoT system.
    3.3. Communication technologies and IoT protocols Section 3.3 produces the answers
    to research questions 4 and 5 in Table 1 while discussing findings on the literature
    related to wireless communication technology and IoT protocols. 3.3.1. Wireless
    communication technology Wireless data transmission is a key function of an IoT
    system. To design a successful Ag-IoT system, it is essential to understand the
    radio frequency (RF) contributing factors that impact signal strength, interference,
    system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Also, understanding of pros and
    cons of wireless communication technologies is essential for a better Ag-IoT device
    selection. Received power (Pr) of wireless data transmission in an unobstructed
    line of sight in a radio signal-free area depends on the transmitter power (Pt),
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains (GTX, GRX), the distance between the transmitter
    and the receiver (R), and the wavelength (λ) of the radio. This relationship is
    expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, long wavelength radio signals such as LoRa in 900
    MHz are suitable for long-distance data transmission compared to short wavelength
    signals such as Wi-Fi operated in 2.4–3.2 GHz without changing other variables.
    For long-distance communication, the plane earth loss formula is used to account
    for the curvature of Earth for signal strength (Nadir et al., 2008). Equation
    1 Friis transmission equation (Shaw, 2013). Furthermore, radio signals are subject
    to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These phenomena are illustrated in
    Fig. 5. In open flat agricultural fields, reflection, scattering, and diffraction
    may not occur unless there are large agricultural structures. In hilly areas and
    forests, the effects of wireless signal propagation properties may need special
    attention when placing IoT devices. The Fresnel Zone is the area around the visual
    line-of-sight that radio waves propagate out once they leave the antenna. Blockage
    of Fresnel Zone >40% causes severe signal losses (Tate et al., 2008). Therefore,
    factors such as the height and density of the crop canopies nearby, the presence
    of agricultural structures (e.g., irrigation pivots and storage silos), the locations
    to place IoT nodes, and the antenna height and position are important to account
    for in ensuring the signal transmission quality. In fact, the research on wireless
    communications in rural and agricultural landscapes has raised a lot of interest
    recently (Vuran et al., 2022). The signal quality is also affected by channel
    noise, interference, multipath fading, and attenuation. The success of data transmission
    is measured by a parameter called bit rate error (BRE). Based on the above discussion
    we would like to suggest that it is important to use wireless signal strength
    mapping tools during IoT system installations. Such tools will help to select
    the optimum IoT communication technology (for example, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Mobile Communication)
    suitable for each case, accounting for data transmission rates and signal losses.
    This practice would help farmers to reduce the capital and operational costs involved
    with IoT systems. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download

    In the literature, we found that a wide variety of wireless communication technologies
    were used by the researchers. Out of the 35 studies where communication technology
    was clearly mentioned, 34% used Wi-Fi, 17% were conducted using LoRa, and 14%
    used Zigbee. Also 11% of the studies used ethernet or the wired internet connection.
    Less attention was received for mobile communication technologies such as 4G (3%),
    NB-IoT (3%), and GSM (3%). In some cases, researchers used two or more technologies
    to connect different areas in the fields such as LoRa / Wi-Fi, LoRa / TV white
    space (TVWS), and GSM / Zigbee. According to the findings, Wi-Fi and ethernet
    were common in greenhouses while others were favored in outdoor farming practices.

    Fig. 6. Communication technologies in Ag-IoT applications. 3.3.2. IoT protocols
    IoT protocols are data transmission standards that allow communication between
    the endpoint and services with the internet being the common network. IoT protocols
    are broadly classified into two major groups: IoT data protocols and IoT network
    protocols. The data protocols correspond to the application layer whereas network
    protocols correspond to the perception and network layer in the standard IoT architecture
    (Fig. 1). IoT network protocols create networks of device connections. Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth are such network protocols, and the same term is
    used to represent wireless communication technology. Some common IoT protocols
    are listed in Table 3 with specifications such as frequency, data rate, and range
    (Triantafyllou et al., 2018; Farooq et al., 2019). Table 3. Common IoT Network

    and privacy protection, easy to install and connect, faster data transfers Each
    IoT network protocol/wireless communication technology has its advantages (Table
    3). Bluetooth is a popular short-range wireless communication technology standard
    convenient to create personal area networks. It is possible to use Bluetooth in
    indoor applications such as mobile phone-connected soil water sensors and sensor
    networking in small greenhouses. ZigBee is useful in large indoor growing spaces
    and LoRa is suitable for field crop monitoring senor networks. Cellular technology
    is useful for indoor or outdoor spaces where the network coverage is available.
    Wi-Fi is suitable for both small or large indoor spaces as well as outdoor applications
    where there is infrastructure support available to setup Wi-Fi gateways. Cellular
    and Wi-Fi allow transmitting images, videos, and other larger data files such
    as 3D point cloud data. Bluetooth shares the same advantage but is limited to
    a short distance. Compared to LoRa, Zigbee, and cellular technology, Wi-Fi has
    high reliability in data transmission, but power consumption is high too. All
    these protocols were tested in real crop growing environments (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016; Codeluppi et al., 2020). 3.4. Cloud platforms and service models
    3.4.1. Cloud platforms Cloud is an essential part of any IoT system. IoT devices
    are not useful without cloud connectivity. Data gathered via individual IoT sensors
    become useful when connected with other relevant sensors. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling
    ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
    computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
    that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
    service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance, 2011). Essential expected characteristics
    of a cloud system are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,
    rapid elasticity, and measured service. Out of the 115 papers we reviewed, only
    25 papers discussed cloud platforms in detail. Among them, 28% of the researchers
    used the ThingSpeak cloud platform developed by MATLAB as the service provider,
    12% used Microsoft Azure, and 12% used Ubidots platform. Furthermore, 12% of the
    researchers built themselves a local data server with the required functionality.
    Google-based Firebase had 8% usage. Other cloud platform service providers including
    Amazon Web Services, cloud sense, generic cloud, sensorDB, SEnviro, and Huawei
    Cloud had 4% use each. The percentage distribution of these cloud platforms is
    given in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Statistics of cloud service provider selection. 3.4.2.
    Public, private, and hybrid cloud In terms of privacy policies, cloud platforms
    can be divided into three major models: 3.4.2.1. Public cloud Services are offered
    over the public internet and available to anyone who needs to purchase them. Third-party
    cloud service providers own and operate the cloud resources such as servers and
    storage in the public cloud model. Users do not need to spend any capital expenditures
    to scale up; applications can be quickly provisioned and terminated; and users
    pay only for what they use. These are the advantages of the public cloud. Amazon
    Web Services and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud services. 3.4.2.2.
    Private cloud A private cloud comprises computing resources used exclusively by
    users from one business or organization therefore hardware must be purchased for
    start-up and maintenance is required. In the private cloud model, infrastructure
    is not shared with users outside the organization. A private cloud can be physically
    placed at a data center owned by the user organization, or it can be hosted by
    a third-party service provider. But the organization has complete control over
    resources and security. 3.4.2.3. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud is a computing environment
    that combines a public and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to
    be shared between them. The organizations determine where to run their applications
    while they control security, compliance, or legal requirements. Some organizations
    use a hybrid cloud model to keep sensitive data in the private cloud whereas frontal
    services and web portals are serviced in the public cloud for scalability. Furthermore,
    the public cloud can act as a supporting system if the data and usage exceeds
    the capacity of the private cloud. 3.4.3. Cloud service model Cloud-based services
    provided to the users can be categorized into three major classes based on the
    hierarchy of the service offered. Typical cloud architecture has nine layers.
    They are from bottom to top in order: network, storage, server, virtualization,
    operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. The next section
    will explain cloud service models in detail with hardware and software layers
    they belong. 3.4.3.1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IaaS was the original
    cloud services model. For IaaS, the cloud service provider will provide the hardware
    and keep it up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration
    are up to the client. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational
    in Microsoft datacenters. The main advantage of the IaaS model is the rapid deployment
    of new computing devices. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure are some
    examples of IaaS. 3.4.3.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) In this cloud service
    model, the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources,
    and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
    For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers
    can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical
    hardware and software requirements. 3.4.3.3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) In the
    case of SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment,
    such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
    The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by
    the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working
    version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. 3.4.3.4. Network-as-a-Service
    (NaaS) Software-defined networking and software-defined perimeters are services
    that belonged to NaaS. NaaS is a cloud model that enables organizations to easily
    operate the network and achieve the outcomes they expect without owning, building,
    or maintaining their infrastructure through the cloud. NaaS can replace hardware-centric
    VPNs, load balancers, firewall appliances, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    connections. Users can scale up and scale down as demand changes, rapidly deploy
    services, and eliminate hardware costs. 3.4.4. Fog and edge computing Edge computing
    is the moving of data processing close to where the data is generated. Wireless
    communication-enabled sensors with microcontrollers can be considered edge computing
    devices. The introduction of the edge computing paradigm was due to issues related
    to centralized cloud computing architecture. Data and control signal transmission
    latency and delays in centralized system data analytics are some disadvantages
    of cloud computing. Therefore, network designers proposed architectures where
    the computing power is distributed more evenly around the network. Fog and edge
    computing push the processing capability out to the edge of the network, closer
    to the source of the data. Such techniques are called fog computing and edge computing.
    Fog computing is a computing layer between the cloud and the edge where edge devices
    send large amounts of data to the cloud. The fog computing layer can get the data
    from the edge layer before it reaches the cloud and filter what is relevant and
    what is not. The filtered data gets stored in the cloud, while the unrelated data
    can be deleted, or analyzed at the fog layer for remote access or to use in localized
    learning models. Precision herbicide applications become popular with field crops.
    There, a moving platform that has a camera, carries and applies the herbicide
    at the exact location of the emerging weed. The image processing hardware and
    software in the moving platform do the image processing instantaneously to reduce
    the delay of cloud-based image processing in larger fields (Coleman et al., 2022).
    The centralized cloud-only needs the weed density from the moving IoT platform
    to forecast the future herbicide need to maintain the required quantity in the
    stocks. Therefore, edge computing is all about placing computing power on the
    very edge of the network, on the actual sensors of the device. Low power consumption
    and low processing power microchips or micro-controllers embedded in the devices
    provide the power for edge computing. For that reason, their processing capacity
    is much more limited but sometimes can be adequate to process images (Chamara
    et al., 2021). 3.4.5. Data analytics in IoT Data analytics is one of the most
    important activities in any IoT system, as the decision-making of an IoT system
    depends on hundreds of sensors and events, which is difficult to analyze manually.
    Data generated by IoT devices fall under three categories. They are structured
    data (such as SQL storage), unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), and semi-structured
    data (like social media feeds). Ag-IoT systems can generate both structured and
    unstructured data (Lea, 2020). Stream processing and batch processing are the
    two main types of data processing techniques. Stream processing is useful for
    mobile Ag-IoT platforms since it allows real-time data processing. Batch processing
    can be applied in irrigation, chemigation, and fertigation applications as data
    are processed as a batch to make the decision. Common data analytics activities
    for IoT platforms are listed in Table 4. Below are some examples how they are
    used in Ag-IoT for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. Alerting allows growers
    to receive an alert message when soil water use exceeds the maximum allowable
    depletion (Gamon et al., 2015). Sensors in the field environment are susceptible
    to problems like physical damage, pest attack, misalignment, and breakdown, which
    cause errors in data streams. These problems can be effectively alleviated by
    error finding. Using time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    or Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to determine the next irrigation or fertigation
    time belongs to trend analysis. Triggering sprinklers in a field based on SWC
    sensor values is an example of signaling. More complex decisions can be formed
    by combining several analytical activities. For example, in automated crop disease
    detection, an average daily temperature above 20 to 25 °C followed by 1–2 in.
    of rain, together with sugar beet leaf color change indicated a sugar beet pathogen
    outbreak (Wolf and Verreet, 2002). This analysis was enabled by data joining,
    tracking, and trend analysis. Table 4. Data analysis activities commonly found
    in Ag-IoT applications. Data analysis activity Function Preprocessing Filter out
    data with little interest to reduce data complexity and duplication Alerting Raise
    an alert if data exceed certain boundary condition Windowing Apply rules on data
    in a predefined time window Joining Combine multiple data streams into a new single
    data stream Error finding Find missing values and anomalies in data streams Tracking
    Identify when or where an event has occurred Trend analysis Quantify change or
    trend of data as a function of time Signaling Send control signal when a decision
    is made 3.5. Power and energy management Power and energy storage are the two
    major driving forces for IoT systems, especially for Ag-IoT located in remote
    fields. In the literature, we found 3 main categories of power management systems.
    Direct main power connected nodes is the first type and most common with indoor
    applications. A rechargeable battery with a recharging option such as solar, hydro,
    or wind is the second option. The third one has a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable
    battery but is designed to consume very low power by sending a very low amount
    of data intermittently. Among the 115 pieces of research we have reviewed, only
    27 of them discussed the IoT system power and energy storage features. Out of
    these 27, 11 platforms used solar power as the main power supply while Lithium
    Polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries were used as the energy storage solution.
    Out of 11 indoor farming applications which explained the power management options,
    9 used the main grid power supply. Research that focused on IoT system setup under
    high dense canopies used high power density and high-capacity battery-only solutions
    such as 12 V lead-acid batteries. Two studies mentioned they used battery with
    solar but did not disclose details about the specifications. It revealed that
    there are very limited power supplies available for in-field IoT implementation
    and the findings are highlighted in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    selection of the Ag-IoT systems in the reviewed studies. Unlike edge-computing
    devices, typical IoT end nodes are designed to be less power-hungry. This power
    consumption goes high due to certain reasons such as connected high throughput
    sensors, significant data processing, and massive data transmission. However,
    these power consumptions can be minimized by exploiting different techniques such
    as the semi-active phase and sleep phase (Zhang and Li, 2019). The edge computing-enabled
    devices need more power. It is essential to standardize the IoT power management
    based on the crop and geographical location of the devices. For example, solar
    power is not a very promising solution for locations with large trees such as
    rubber, pepper, and spices that have a dense crop canopy 5–10 m above the ground
    (Villalba et al., 2017). 3.6. Actuators Monitoring and controlling are two agricultural
    operations closely related to each other. Monitoring by itself is an open-loop
    operation; whereas monitoring, controlling, and again monitoring the effects of
    controlling make a system closed loop and can improve the efficiency of the system.
    Efficient controlling of the actuators based on the monitoring is a key feature
    in the agricultural domain for optimizing inputs, maximizing crop yield and quality,
    and reducing the negative environmental impacts. Fig. 9 depicts the number of
    actuators controlled via IoT systems that were reported in our reviewed papers.
    Out of the 115 studies, 54 mentioned IoT-enabled actuation. Some studies used
    more than one actuator, whereas most of the in-field IoT sensor monitoring systems
    did not mention the use of actuators. Download : Download high-res image (130KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Count of actuators controlled via
    IoT systems found in the reviewed papers. Since water is the largest input by
    volume applied to farms, actuators related to water have been mostly discussed
    in the research work. Such controllers are pumps and solenoid valves. Controlling
    these two actuators were demonstrated in 22 and 8 instances, respectively. After
    irrigation, controlling lighting was the most occurred application in indoor farming
    followed by ventilation, fertigation, alert, and air conditioning. Ventilation
    allows outdoor air to come inside the greenhouse while air conditioning includes
    heating or cooling of the air. Alert meant the system sent an email or message
    to the farmer or the operator of the farm when a parameter exceeded a threshold
    value. An IoT-controlled insect repellent actuator was demonstrated twice among
    the 115 case studies evaluated. Automation of soil bed preparation was achieved
    by utilizing stepper motors in one instance of IoT-based indoor farming. According
    to Figure 9, water pumps and valves were the most frequently used actuators, and
    all these systems were closed loop control systems with soil moisture sensors
    and ET modeling. From the study of the above actuator-related research, it can
    be said that there is enormous potential to automate the controlling of the indoor
    crop''s required environment and soil preparation. (See Fig. 9.) 3.7. Ag-IoT for
    crop monitoring Out of the 115 publications reviewed, 71 systems were demonstrated
    in a real environment. Among them, 65% were implemented in the fields, 24% were
    demonstrated in indoor environments, and 11% were simulations. This is an interesting
    finding that reveals the huge potential of implementing outdoor or in-field IoT
    applications. Typically, it is easy to set up indoor IoT sensor networks due to
    fewer technological barriers, such as extreme environmental conditions and sensor
    connectivity issues. Since real applications were available only in 65% (71 out
    of 115) instances, further real implementations can be done to demonstrate the
    capability of Ag-IoT applications. Considering the 71 systems that demonstrated
    the real applications, 49 were practically demonstrated with certain types of
    crops and 22 did not mention the specific crop they used. 15% of these systems
    were demonstrated with grapes while cereal crops accounted for 26%. One research
    was based on both grapes and oranges. In total 50% of the IoT studies focused
    on perennial specialty crops of higher value including grape, moringa, orange,
    citrus, sugarcane, silver maple, apricot, cashew, and olive (Fig. 10). This result
    indicates that IoT can be implemented with diverse crop types to achieve various
    purposes. Ag-IoT systems are easy to set up on perennial croplands as there is
    less soil preparation for the IoT system installation. It is important to develop
    techniques that allow easy IoT implementation to the annual crops as they contribute
    more to global food security. It is also worth to note only one research demonstrated
    the economic viability of IoT implementation (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, future
    research to assess and understand the economic viability of IoT applications in
    various situations is needed. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download

    crop types. 4. Challenges of Ag-IoT systems and potential solutions Ag-IoT faces
    challenges that are unique compared with IoT applications in other industries.
    In this section, we briefly discuss those challenges that are of utmost importance
    for Ag-IoT system researchers and developers. Ag-IoT challenges can be mainly
    classified into three sections: technical challenges, sectoral challenges, and
    business challenges (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.1. Technical challenges Limitations
    of the advancement of technology are the reasons for technical challenges. They
    would likely be effectively addressed as tools and technologies advance with time.
    The Ag-IoT technical challenges are discussed under the three layers of the IoT
    architecture (Fig. 1), namely, perception layer issues, network layer issues,
    and application layer issues. 4.1.1. Perception layer issues Ag-IoT systems''
    perception layer faces unique challenges, because of the requirements it needs
    to meet during crop and environmental monitoring in harsh environments (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Agricultural lands have limited electricity and communication infrastructure.
    It is not practical or cost-effective to use wired power and communication media
    to connect IoT nodes in the field. Therefore, power management, device longevity,
    and ergonomic design are major challenges related to the Ag-IoT perception layer.
    Power management includes Ag-IoT node-level power generation, strategies to reduce
    power consumption, and energy storage. Section 3.5 Power and Energy Management
    revealed that most of the researchers were interested in solar with rechargeable
    batteries as the power source in agriculture. However, there is a challenge to
    introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under the tall and dense
    crop canopy. Micro wind turbines have the potential as an Ag-IoT power source
    but receive less attention in the literature (Jawad et al., 2017). Continuous
    improvements have been made to rechargeable batteries due to the demand for high
    energy to weight ratio batteries. There are several approaches available to reduce
    power consumption. One approach is to select sensors, actuators, and wireless
    protocols with low energy consumption. Selection of a node duty cycle that turns
    the sensor or actuator on when it reads, sends, or receives signals is another
    viable approach (Estrada-Lopez et al., 2018). Harsh environmental conditions such
    as wind and rainfall, continuous high solar radiation, sub-zero temperatures in
    winter, chemicals commonly used in agriculture, and animal attacks make it difficult
    to keep Ag-IoT nodes in the field in operable conditions for a long time (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Sensors, cables, and enclosures should be designed to withstand
    such conditions. Standards are available to follow in most cases, but the cost
    becomes high when required standards need to be escalated. Analog signals (Analogue
    voltage or current), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), Serial Data Interface at
    1200 baud rate (SDI-12), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
    are the common sensor to microcontroller data transmission techniques. The microcontroller
    development boards and commercial IoT platforms are designed to work with different
    voltage levels, such as 3.3 V, 5 V, 7 V, and 12 V. These different communication
    protocols and operation voltages have created barriers to the interoperability
    of the devices in Ag-IoT implementation. Research and development to standardize
    data communication and power supply in Ag-IoT systems would substantially increase
    the scalability, upgradability, and interoperability in the perception layer.
    Improving ergonomic design and reducing the labor intensiveness for deploying
    Ag-IoT systems in the field are urgently needed. IoT-based soil water content
    monitoring is a good example to show this issue. Often soil sensors are buried
    underground for continuous measurements during a season. These sensor nodes also
    have an aboveground section to allow wireless communication, which could interfere
    with farm operations such as tillage, fertilizer application, and chemical spraying,
    and should be closely monitored. For annual crops, the need to remove the sensors
    when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a significant
    logistic issue for using them effectively. Research on underground wireless communication
    technology (Akyildiz et al., 2009) and Internet of Underground Things (Vuran et
    al., 2018) is ongoing, bearing the promise to alleviate this challenge associated
    with Ag-IoT node installation and maintenance. No standards are currently available
    on Ag-IoT installation as agricultural fields and practices are highly heterogeneous.
    Novel solutions are necessary to encourage Ag-IoT users. 4.1.2. Network layer
    issues The most common Ag-IoT network layer issues are internet coverage, standard
    interception, interference, propagation losses, communication range, wireless
    link quality, network expansion, network management, communication protocols,
    latency, and throughput. As most farms are in rural areas, remote locations, or
    mountain regions, it is a huge challenge to get internet connectivity to them
    since these underpopulated areas have limited internet infrastructure. One solution
    could be creating a local network, a concept similar to a hybrid cloud. This type
    of system does not connect to the internet but still allows local servers to perform
    the basic IoT functionality (Akyildiz et al., 2009). Due to the recent advancement
    in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it would soon be possible to have internet
    connectivity via satellite as illustrated in Fig. 11 on a commercial scale (Ivanova
    et al., 2016). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the future, many agricultural
    fields will rely on satellite-based connectivity to connect their gateways to
    the internet. This system consists of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) type
    ground antenna which is connected to the nodes through multiple gateways. Gateways
    can follow different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, or Zigbee.
    One disadvantage of satellite-based internet connectivity is that it needs a clear
    sky to make a successful connection. Therefore, it is logical to have a local
    server for data storage and decision-making when the connection is interrupted.

    Fig. 11. Future Ag-IoT system with satellite connected internet. Standard interception
    refers to difficulties in using the full potential of a communication technology
    due to standards imposed by regulatory authorities to limit the use. Recent advancements
    on long-range low throughput communication technologies such as LoRa become widely
    known communication protocols in Ag-IoT. To promote fair use of LoRa bandwidth,
    governments can regulate the use of wireless frequencies. For example, in Europe,
    the duty cycle or the transmitter uptime of the LoRa node is between 0.1% to 10%.
    This is a challenge in most Ag-IoT applications as there are higher volumes of
    data to transmit and many sensors and actuators to connect. When many IoT nodes
    are deployed, the interference may occur because the data transmission could use
    the same frequency, especially in unlicensed spectrums, such as ZigBee, Sigfox,
    LoRa, and Wi-Fi. Signal interference causes data loss and reduces the reliability
    of the systems (Elijah et al., 2018). Wireless signal propagation strength, communication
    range, and wireless link quality depend on the humidity, temperature, crop growth
    status, and crop morphological characteristics in agriculture fields (Tzounis
    et al., 2017; Cama-Pinto et al., 2019; Vuran et al., 2022). Thus, wireless signal
    propagation strength simulation and visualization software are essential in the
    future for the mass installation of Ag-IoT sensor nodes. Such software will reduce
    the complexity of node placement issues. 4.1.3. Application layer issues Data
    security, data privacy, and data analysis are application layer issues. Ag-IoT
    data is important for a country''s food security as well as for the Ag business
    model security. In the modern competitive world, data breaching could lead to
    a competitive disadvantage on Ag-business model over a competitor as well as risk
    the food security of a country. Therefore, more focus should be put into improving
    the security and privacy of data generated via Ag-IoT systems. 4.2. Sectoral challenges
    4.2.1. Regulatory issues Data ownership creates another business challenge. Companies
    that provide Ag-IoT services can use the data for improvements in their systems,
    but farmers do not receive compensation for that. There is a challenge to implement
    such a system to prevent data monopoly (Misra et al., 2020). Therefore, regulation
    and legal frameworks about the control and rights of data between farmers and
    IoT companies need to be established (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.2.2. Interoperability
    issue According to Elijah et al. (2018), interoperability involves the ability
    to have technical, synthetic, semantic, and organization interoperability. Technical
    interoperability involves the effortless communication among IoT devices using
    protocols. Data interchanging between systems is semantic interoperability. Synthetic
    interoperability deals with IoT system-generated digital data exchange with humans,
    while organization interoperability involves information sharing among different
    regions, infrastructures, and cultures (Elijah et al., 2018). Here we would like
    to introduce a challenge associated with Ag-IoT system interoperability. As most
    of the farmers have crop rotations and multi-cropping systems, it is essential
    to have Ag-IoT systems with context awareness that allows them to work with different
    cropping systems. The heterogeneity of agricultural systems imposes the system
    interoperability challenge. 4.2.3. Business issues The cost and non-availability
    of skilled personnel in Ag-IoT is a business issue. Cost is a challenge for Ag-IoT
    implementation. There are three types of costs involved with Ag-IoT systems: the
    setup cost or the capital expenditure, running cost or operational cost, and upgrading
    cost. Due to the nature of IoT business models and being a relatively new technology,
    analysis on return on investment of Ag-IoT systems is not yet discussed considerably
    in the literature. Chen et al. (2019) highlighted that application of IoT systems
    on irrigation controlling in turmeric turned out to be profitable. Several factors
    increase capital expenditure. Remote and harsh environmental conditions that Ag-IoT
    systems must bear increase the production cost of Ag-IoT systems. Ag-IoT end nodes
    require materials that do not wear and tear due to sun, rain, and chemicals applied
    during crop cultivation. Communication cost is usually a standard rate, but the
    initial investment is required to set up the internet connection, and this cost
    depends on the infrastructure availability where the farms are located. Theoretical
    knowledge and practical experience about the sensing/actuating system and parameters
    of interest are essential to set up a successful Ag-IoT system. Sensor data interpreters
    need an overall understanding of the agroecological principles to reach a decision
    (Duff et al., 2022). Reluctance to use new technology and unskilled manpower are
    apparent obstacles to implementing Ag-IoT in commercial production crop monitoring
    systems. More extension programs are needed to solve this issue while standards
    are necessary for Ag-IoT system development to improve the common Ag-IoT platforms
    that have interoperable qualities. 5. Supporting technologies 5.1. Augmented reality
    and IoT applications Data visualization and real-time decision-making are important
    to IoT. Based on past literature this sector is the least explored area. Wearable
    augmentation devices improve crop monitoring and control. Smart glasses have the
    real-time data visualization capability to indicate the status of crops, soil,
    or environment (Hurst et al., 2021). An irrigation activity can be controlled
    manually by a farmer if he can visualize the real-time soil water content change
    in the field. The conditions within a greenhouse can be controlled in real-time
    and actuators can be controlled via voice command through a smart glass. Harvesting
    can be more enjoyable and more efficient (lower loss) based on image processing
    capable smart glasses. Vegetable or fruit pickers can be assisted through a smart
    glass by viewing what it detects in the fruit to decide whether to pick it or
    not. Untrained labor usage-related losses can be reduced by augmented reality
    related training. 5.2. Big data Big data generated by Ag-IoT are mostly of heterogeneous
    types. The most common IoT agricultural big data are machine-generated data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). These data are generated from a massive number of sensors and smart
    machines used to measure and record farming processes; which are in turn boosted
    by the IoT. Machine-generated data range from simple sensor records to complex
    computer logs. Big data in agriculture are generated mostly when we introduce
    smart sensing and monitoring with the help of IoT. The main sources of big data
    in Ag-IoT are: sensors, robotics, open data, data captured by airborne sensors
    (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014; Cole et al., 2012), weather/climate data, yield data,
    soil types, agricultural census data (Chen et al., 2014) and so on. Typically,
    telemetry data is generated by sensors such as temperature, rotary, or linear
    encoder. These data are well-structured in contrast to imagery data which need
    post-processing. Such unstructured data have issues in terms of availability,
    quality, and formats (Liu et al., 2015) and can be a concern. As the number of
    sensors is increasing and data volumes are growing rapidly, it is becoming a matter
    of utmost importance to store and process big data. Some approaches to handle
    big data are data shrinking, scale up, scale out, and high-performance computing.
    Data shrinking is the process of throwing away some less important data and still
    being able to reconstruct the original data. Scale-up (vertical scalability) is
    adding additional storage and RAM to store and process the big data in the processing
    node. But this technique has its capacity limit. Scale out (horizontal scalability)
    is the concept of using parallel computers to store and process that big data.
    High-Performance Computing is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to handle
    big data, where computers with multiple cores are grouped to create an efficient
    network to deal with the big data. These techniques are essential for successful
    data handling in Ag-IoT. 5.3. Artificial intelligence in Ag-IoT Techniques that
    enable machines to mimic human behavior are artificial intelligence (AI), while
    a subset of AI that gives machines the ability of learning without being explicitly
    programmed is machine learning. Deep learning techniques are a subset of machine
    learning techniques with multilayer neural network feasibility. The data generated
    from the Ag-IoTs are often used to train machine learning models for specific
    agricultural use cases such as yield forecast, crop stress detection, and pest
    spreading prediction. To be more specific, for the agricultural IoT applications,
    raw sensing information such as field and weather conditions and crop status can
    be collected and used for model training locally or in the remote end that has
    more computational resources. These trained models can later be used to control
    actuators for variable rate irrigation and site-specific pesticide/ herbicide
    applications. Deep learning techniques are heavily used with image processing
    applications in agriculture. Trained deep learning models are available for crop
    type detection (de Filho et al., 2020), plant phenotyping (Pound et al., 2017),
    fruit (Patel et al., 2011), flower (Dias et al., 2018), and leaf detection (Chamara
    et al., 2021), and weed detection for herbicide applications (Coleman et al.,
    2022). AI becomes an integral part of IoT due to its capability of using it as
    a data analytics tool. 6. Ag-IoT for farming systems analyses and management In
    this section, we briefly discuss and envision how Ag-IoT would benefit and potentially
    transform farming systems analyses and management, enabled by its unprecedented
    data, analytics, and connected sensors and actuators. Perhaps the most obvious
    advantages of Ag-IoT come from the high spatiotemporal resolution of farm-level
    data it generates concerning crops, soil, and microclimate (Kagan et al., 2022).
    The high spatial resolution data would quantify the the spatial variability of
    crop parameters (such as yield and leaf area index) and soil parameters (such
    as pH, organic matter, and water holding capacility), and elucidate the relationships
    between them to identify yield-limiting factors at different parts of the field
    (Alfred et al., 2021). This is the underlying principle of site-specific crop
    management, which will be greatly enhanced through Ag-IoT. Modern Ag-IoTs take
    measurements at hourly and sub-hourly intervals. This high temporal resolution
    data allow us to observe the crop responses to environmental cues at finer time
    steps, and enhance our understanding on how basic plant physiological processes
    such as transpiration and photosynthesis vary due to short-term environmental
    fluctuations. Process-based crop and soil models, which are widely used to evaluate
    the economic and environmental consequences of farming practices, usually suffer
    from the lack of site-specific data to parameterize and calibrate them, especially
    the in-season crop data and soil data. These data are exactly what Ag-IoT sensors
    are good at generating, and therefore would improve the accuracy of these models
    for farm-level management assessment. Networked sensors and actuators of Ag-IoT,
    along with the real-time data processing, transmission, and modeling, would greatly
    improve the decision-making cycle of farm-level management practices (Chaterji
    et al., 2021). The traditional crop management decision-making has several limitations.
    First, the decision is usually based on a single set of data, because other datasets
    are unavailable or expensive to obtain. Second, there is usually long latency
    between data generation and decision-making (e.g., several days or weeks). This
    long latency is in contrast to the fact that many stresses in the field (such
    as pest outbreak) occur and develop quickly and need real-time intervention to
    prevent substantial loss. Thirdly, the present management practice only addresses
    one factor at a time whereas in reality crops can undergo multiple stresses simultaneously.
    Altogether, these limitations reflect our inability to capture the complexity
    of the farming system. Ag-IoT has the potential to transform farm-level decision-making
    by enabling multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategies, powered by real-time
    data processing and relevant models run in the cloud to shorten the latency. For
    example, crop, soil, and microclimate sensors can simultaneously measure the crop
    water and nitrogen status, soil moisture content and nitrate content, and weather
    variables. These multi-source inputs can be fed into the models to output two
    variables: a nitrogen sufficiency index and a water sufficiency index. These two
    variables can further be converted to a nitrogen and water application rate for
    site-specific fertigation. This paradigm has several advantages. First, it is
    a multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategy that accounts for the interaction
    between the water and nitrogen stresses. Second, it reduces the cost of implementation
    and shortens the management cycle because two actions are combined into one (one
    pass of field equipment instead of two). In a similar fashion, decisions such
    as pesticide applications and other chemicals (fungicides, growth regulators)
    could potentially be further stacked to make crop production more efficient. Traditionally,
    farm system analyses and management happen at the individual farm level (Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2019). In other words, data are usually not shared or co-analyzed
    across the farm boundary. In the era of Ag-IoT where farm data are shared and
    stored in the cloud, there represents an opportunity where the analysis and modeling
    of Ag-IoT data can cover a group of farms or at a regional scale. These regional
    analyses would answer other important questions such as regional yield forecasting,
    pest tracking, or agricultural resource prioritization. These questions are not
    necessarily important for individual growers, but are at the heart of other stakeholders
    such as policy makers and input suppliers. Data ownership and privacy, covered
    in Section 4, are two big issues that should be resolved before this type of analysis
    may occur. 7. Conclusions and future directions 7.1. Conclusions Ag-IoT is a promising
    technology that would increase resource use efficiency in agricultural systems,
    and is an essential tool for digital agriculture transformation. In this paper,
    we have overviewed impactful research related to Ag-IoT in the past decade. The
    data collected from these papers were categorized and analyzed under six main
    Ag-IoT system design parameters namely sensors, sensing platforms and main control
    board, communication technology and IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and
    energy management, and actuators. According to the analyzed data, it is revealed
    that there is an increased global attention towards the Ag-IoT system-related
    research in the recent years. However, there are certain research gaps found in
    the literature. One of them is that the implementations of the sensors and the
    actuators seem to be limited to soil and environmental parameter monitoring and
    irrigation controlling. Furthermore, crop macro and micronutrient demand analyses
    are still at the infant stage due to the non-availability of sensors that can
    measure nutrients in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to improve the sensor
    and actuator applications in crop monitoring and controlling. In addition, heterogeneity
    of the system parameters (such as data, platforms, required power) is a major
    challenge to the Ag-IoT systems implementation, to which the improvement of the
    context-awareness could be a solution. Power harness options for Ag-IoT nodes
    need more exploration as there are limited options available and it would be a
    big advantage for the perennial crop monitoring. The perception and the network
    layers of Ag-IoT systems require more improvements to meet the sensor implementation
    ergonomics and long-range high-throughput data transmission, respectively. Edge
    computing can be a replacement of the high throughput long-range communication,
    but to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of practical applications
    have been developed based on edge computing to date. Mobile Ag-IoT platforms such
    as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have a huge potential to increase the spatiotemporal
    resolution in Ag-IoT-based monitoring and controlling. 7.2. Future directions
    From the finding of this review, authors would like to highlight some important
    future requirements for Ag-IoT. The entire Ag-IoT research community needs to
    propose a complete system design for Ag-IoT that will be viable, open, and interpretable.
    The objective is to enable the interconnectivity of heterogeneous systems and
    sharing resources to obtain more detailed and specific agricultural data. Furthermore,
    in the future research work, there is a need to develop complete information perception
    standards and design multi-protocol compatible gateways. With some significant
    efforts in the above-mentioned future research directions, the entire research
    community will be able to solve the problems of inconsistent device interfaces
    and protocols, making the system faster, robust, and more convenient. Making full
    use of long-range low throughput communication technology, virtual reality/augmented
    reality, and big data/AI for Ag-IoT is yet to be thoroughly explored. Declaration

  description: Agriculture has a significant role in society by providing food and
    acting as the foundation of many developing countries' economies. With an estimated
    9.75 billion people on the planet by 2050, food production must rise to meet the
    growing demand. It is getting harder to increase food production since there is
    a lack of fertile land. To solve this issue, increase output per unit area, and
    achieve the desired outcome, precision agriculture technologies are being used.
    The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning
    are among the smart technologies that are being adopted by an increasing number
    of industries, including agriculture. Automated irrigation systems can be advantageous
    for farmers who practice precision agriculture, who can also gain valuable knowledge
    about their crops and lessen their environmental impact. With the help of these
    technological advancements, farmers can now more easily manage farming processes.
    This article summarizes the types of sensors needed for agriculture, the communication

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture has a significant role in society by providing
    food and acting as the foundation of many developing countries'' economies. With
    an estimated 9.75 billion people on the planet by 2050, food production must rise
    to meet the growing demand. It is getting harder to increase food production since
    there is a lack of fertile land. To solve this issue, increase output per unit
    area, and achieve the desired outcome, precision agriculture technologies are
    being used. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine
    learning are among the smart technologies that are being adopted by an increasing
    number of industries, including agriculture. Automated irrigation systems can
    be advantageous for farmers who practice precision agriculture, who can also gain
    valuable knowledge about their crops and lessen their environmental impact. With
    the help of these technological advancements, farmers can now more easily manage
    farming processes. This article summarizes the types of sensors needed for agriculture,
    the communication technologies used, and various aspects of smart farming. The
    roles of Artificial intelligence, 5G, and Blockchain in smart farming are discussed.

    IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction According to a
    recent statement by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Program (WWAP), the world''s
    population will increase by 33% in 2050, increasing the demand for food and water.
    The globe as a whole and the developing nations in particular will suffer greatly
    from this. As a result, nations are attempting to improve agriculture''s sustainability
    by using various technologies. Smart farming is the use of contem-porary information
    and communication technologies (ICT) in agriculture to increase crop yield and
    financial rewards while also aiming to have a smaller environmental impact. Fig.
    1 explains how traditional farming has been transformed into smart farming. Historically,
    humans have been cultivating to obtain the food they require for survival. Agriculture
    is the name of the activity, which evolved over a considerable period of time
    from agriculture 1.0 to 4.0. Farmers used sickles and pitchforks in the seventeenth
    century, a period known as “Agri-culture 1.0,” to cultivate their land. Such farming
    techniques require a lot of manpower to carry out agricultural tasks. The crops,
    however, produced very little. Then, in the 20th century, agriculture 2.0 emerged,
    building on the accomplishments of the previous generation to increase production.
    To cut labor expenses and boost output, this generation introduced a variety of
    agricultural instruments and machines for all agriculturerelated activities. As
    a result, new technologies for agriculture 2.0 are created. The food supply chain
    has also benefited from recent advancements in the transportation industry, enabling
    the long-distance transit of agricultural consignments. Communication technology,
    software engineering, and Robots are examples of third-generation agricultural
    advancements that have improved the operation of modern machinery. The aforementioned
    technologies helped create Agriculture 3.0, a new age of farming. In summary,
    the three agricultural revolutions led to a huge increase in crop productivity.
    Additionally, laborintensive traditional farming methods gave way to the use of
    contemporary practices in agriculture. In terms of efficiency and productivity,
    current developments in agricultural industrialization have begun to rule the
    market globally. However, a number of issues, including digitization, issues in
    the supply chain, ecological issues, and crop yield, need to be addressed in the
    current context of smart farming. In the current environment, integrating modern
    technologies is necessary to increase agricultural activity. In an effort to address
    the shortcomings of the previous generation, agriculture 4.0 has recently been
    presented. Appliances, devices, sensors and actuators called things now connected
    to a network, which is known as the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]–[3]. They can
    be used in conjunction with one another to complete challenging tasks that need
    high intelligence. IoT implementation is thought to be the best option because
    agriculture requires constant monitoring and control. The major components of
    IoT are devices, software, sensor systems, actuators, and connections. They may
    now be deployed in enormous numbers throughout vast indoor and outdoor agricultural
    fields because of the accessibility of affordable, portable, power-efficient technology
    with wireless communication. To evaluate soil conditions, tough hardware modules
    may be buried underground. Other modules may be able to survive adverse weather
    conditions, including sunlight, rain, and high humidity. Graphical Processing
    Units (GPUs), another type of specialized hardware, can process enormous volumes
    of data gathered by these. On the software side, current technologies like big
    data and AI use this data gathered by the sensors as input to the AI-based predictors
    that may provide farmers with new insights. The advantages of this technological
    revolution include increased crop yield, water saving, and reduced use of fertilizers.
    In numerous industries, including healthcare, smart homes, smart cities, logistics,
    agriculture, smart grid, and autonomous vehicles [4]–[10]. Fig. 1. Technological
    changes in Agriculture Industry Show All SECTION II. Applications of Iot in Smart
    Farming and Related Works In smart farming, IoT makes its major contribution at
    each stage of agriculture, from seed selection to supply chain management. Crop
    management, Irrigation scheduling, livestock, and greenhouses are the main ways
    IoT is used in agriculture. Agricultural land and livestock, which are connected
    to the cloud, are monitored with the help of different WSN-based IoT sensors and
    devices, which support farmers in collecting useful data from agriculture fields
    through sensors. Some IoT- based setups use cloud services to analyze and process
    data from far away or at the network edge. This helps researchers and farmers
    make better decisions. A plan is made for IoT management that keeps an eye on
    things like weather, soil, air, and water. The environment is also monitored by
    IoT, which generates detailed analyses of temperature, hazardous radiation levels,
    noise levels, and air and water contamination. Additionally, information obtained
    regarding various environmental characteristics is communicated to the user via
    warnings or messages with recommendations to the authorities. Smart irrigation
    systems include data acquisition (sensor), data processing, fault detection, wireless
    communication, and irrigation control. Smart farming is a way to grow food in
    a clean and sustainable way that requires a lot of money and high-tech tools.
    We are talking about a system that uses sensors to keep an eye on the crop field.
    These sensors keep track of everything that is important for growing crops, such
    as the soil''s moisture, humidity, light, temperature, and so on. They also automate
    the irrigation system. With this system, farmers can check on their fields from
    anywhere. IoT -based farming is a lot more effective than traditional farming.
    So, it''s important to gather, summarize, analyze, and sort the latest research
    in this area. A vast number of IoT applications for agriculture have been released
    in recent years. We categorize these applications into groups based on their functions
    in accordance with survey results, including monitoring, tracking, and traceability;
    controlling; and modern agriculture such as soilless agriculture and greenhouse
    production. The system measures a number of different parameters, including air
    quality, temperature, humidity, soil, water, fertilizer, insect management, light
    control, and location tracking Fig. 2. Applications of IoT in various Industries
    Show All Fig. 3. Different stages of Smart Farming Show All A. Soil Condition
    Management Effective monitoring systems are essential for creating an irrigation
    control system that can boost production in smart agriculture since they have
    an impact on how plants grow and develop. The climate has a considerable impact
    on crop production. Variable crops need different climate conditions to grow;
    hence, any change in climate has a major negative impact on crop yield in terms
    of both quantity and quality. The main factors needed for the growth of the plant
    are considered to be soil moisture and a proper amount of water. To maintain an
    ideal watering schedule, effective soil moisture monitoring may be regarded as
    essential. These factors also enhance the control of crop-growing conditions.
    In [11]–[14], authors proposed various soil monitoring systems for smart farming.
    B. Irrigation Scheduling and Water Management The method by which an irrigator
    chooses the amount and timing of water to be applied to the crop is known as irrigation
    scheduling. Estimating the water needs of crops for various growth stages and
    environmental conditions is difficult. Fig. 4. Application domains of IoT in smart
    agriculture Show All Knowing how much water the plant can consume and how efficiently
    it can use it will help you avoid overwatering or underwatering. This can be measured
    using a variety of techniques, such as plant observation, soil feel and look,
    soil moisture monitoring equipment, and available water from weather information
    [15]–[17]. Field-deployed sensors are used in IoT-powered smart irrigation systems
    to track soil characteristics, weather and climatic conditions, and agricultural
    parameters for irrigation. To track various soil, water body, plant, and microclimate
    parameters, it employs distributed sensors. The values observed by these sensors
    can be communicated to farmers through the cloud, and they can activate the water
    outlets from anywhere at any time. C. Live Stock Management It enables farmers
    to monitor the condition of animals in their herd from their location and receive
    warnings if anything deviates from the required range. This information helps
    the farmers identify the affected livestock without personally examining the This
    also helps to identify which livestock is affected and which is not, saving them
    from having to personally examine the vital signs of each individual animal to
    determine whether a sickness has spread. The whereabouts, health, and well-being
    of the cattle are tracked by owners of huge farms using wireless IoT applications.
    As owners can find their cattle with the use of IoT-based sensors, it is also
    helpful for reducing labor costs. For example, an IoT-based monitoring system
    for large-scale pig farms, measurement of temperature without contact, and surveillance
    of animals to ensure disease detection and animal health were proposed by authors
    in [18]–[22]. They also provided recommendations for farmers in rural areas regarding
    animal health. D. Agricultural Drones Technology has improved significantly and
    more quickly during the past few years. The use of drones in farming is a great
    example of this progression. Drones are being employed in the agriculture sector
    to advance many farming practices. The several types of UAVs used in precision
    agriculture are listed by the authors in [23]–[25] and offer solutions for evaluating
    the health of animals, crop monitoring, pesticide application, irrigation, planting,
    and soil monitoring. With technological revolutions and proper planning based
    on real-time data collection, drone technology has the potential to change the
    agriculture economy. The information gathered by drones can help farmers better
    understand plant health, plant count, yield forecasting, plant height, drainage
    mapping, weed pressure mapping, and other topics Fig. 5. Applications of IoT in
    Smart Agriculture Show All Fig. 6. Applications of UAV in smart Agriculture Show
    All E. Smart Greenhouses Smart green houses will help farmers improve the quality
    and productivity of agriculture. By using a proportional control system or manual
    intervention, greenhouses keep an eye on and regulate the environmental conditions.
    IoT can be used to build a smart greenhouse, which is a better option than a smart
    home controlled manually. These clever greenhouses can monitor and manage the
    climate without any kind of operator assistance [26]. Sensors deployed on agricultural
    land are used to monitor various factors, including humidity, pH, temperature,
    CO2, electrical conductivity, and pesticides needed, which helps with early fault
    detection and diagnosis. A decision support system (DSS) serves as the overall
    controlling and coordinating mechanism for all actions [27]–[28]. Remote access
    is created by connecting the system to the cloud via IoT. This reduces the requirement
    for ongoing manual supervision. The greenhouse''s internal control action is implemented
    by the cloud server, which also manages data processing. F. Smart Agri-Supply
    Chain Management The goal of the food supply system is to create a smart delivery
    model that will allow crops to be delivered from the farm to the table. Scalability,
    a high level of system dependability, and data correctness are not ensured in
    current food traceability solutions. In addition, traceability procedures in modern
    supply chain networks are laborious and complex. Block chain technology promises
    to develop a new ontology for supply chain traceability in order to reduce these
    worries. In [29], authors have proposed a block chain-IoT-based food traceability
    system (BIFTS) to include the unique deployment of block chain, IoT technology,
    and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for controlling
    perishable food. All transactions are recorded on a block chain, which then uploads
    the data to the Interplanetary File Storage Approach according to the trustworthy
    system outlined in [30]. This system ensures traceability, trust, and delivery
    mechanisms in the agri-food supply chain. G. Crop Disease and Pest Detection Crop
    yield is directly affected by pest and plant disease activity. Pests frequently
    cause bacterial infections in crops, which lead to widespread crop illnesses.
    According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), pests and diseases cause
    a 20-40% annual loss in crop output worldwide. To avoid this loss and reduce agricultural
    damage, a lot of pesticides need to be sprayed. but pesticides are harmful to
    human and animal health. They also have a significant, even irreversible, negative
    impact on the environment, ultimately contaminating entire ecosystems. Recent
    Internet of Things (IoT)-based intelligent gadgets, such as wireless sensors,
    robots, and drones, are enabling producers to drastically reduce pesticide usage
    by accurately recognizing crop enemies [31]–[32], which will reduce the necessity
    for pesticides. H. Computer Imaging Physically counting fruits and flowers and
    estimating agricultural production is a time-consuming and expensive process.
    Crop yield estimation and prediction are made more accurate and reliable by remote
    sensing technologies. Accurate field and yield maps are produced by automating
    image analysis using computer vision and deep learning algorithms. This imaging
    technique primarily employs sensor cameras that are placed throughout the farm
    to provide images that are later processed digitally. Image processing combined
    with machine learning improves the quality by comparing photos from the database
    with photos of crops to assess their size, shape, color, and growth. Computer
    imagery can help with sorting and grading. [33]. SECTION III. Architecture of
    Iot-Based Smart Farming The major elements of IoT-based smart farming architecture
    are Sensors nodes Network and Gateway that allows devices to be part of the IoT
    Data storage spaces and decision support system End-user applications A. Sensors
    Sensors are the devices that detect and react to specific inputs, such as light,
    motion, pressure, heat, or moisture, and convert them into representations or
    signals that can be interpreted by people for further interpretation and processing.
    The requirement for incorporating smart agriculture is made possible by the numerous
    types of sensors used in agriculture. Since they are responsible for gathering
    the data needed for smart agriculture systems from the farm. B. Communication
    Between Iot Devices A collection of guidelines known as a communication protocol
    facilitates safe data transfer between computers, servers, and other storage and
    processing equipment. Communication technology is a crucial connection in IoT
    applications that connect gateways and end sensors. Every IoT communication protocol
    has unique qualities that make it better suited for some projects than others.
    The range, memory requirement, power consumption, installation expenses, etc.
    of protocols vary greatly. Some only allow device connections within a single
    building, while others allow communication over long distances. For instance,
    Bluetooth, a popular IoT communication technology used in smart homes, exercise
    equipment, and healthcare, requires little power and memory to function. From
    device to device device to act as a gateway device to the cloud or a data center
    Things that are currently connected to the Internet can communicate with one another
    in a variety of ways. Some examples of these technologies are blue tooth, RFID,
    NFC, LoRa, cellular,Cellular and NB IOT. Each method of communication has advantages
    and disadvantages. Bluetooth is typically used for close-range wireless communication.
    In comparison to other communication channels, it consumes a lot of power and
    is rarely used for field consolidation. ZigBee is a superior short-range wireless
    communication mode to Bluetooth since it is less expensive, consumes less power,
    and is simple to set up. When a slow data transport rate is required, it works
    well. RFID is increasingly used. Since it uses wireless technology, it doesn''t
    need a wire [34]. Table I Sensors used in smart agriculture and its uses 1) Lora
    and Lorawan LoRaWAn is a transmission protocol introduced by the LoRa Alliance
    to satisfy the demands of IoT services. There is a built-in security layer, quick
    implementation, and maximum coverage over hundreds of square meters. It has low
    power consumption and few maintenance requirements, making it perfect for several
    sensors. Due to the aforementioned factors, LoRaWAn is ideal for Internet of Things
    (IoT) applications across a variety of industries. With the help of the low-power,
    long-range spread spectrum modulation method known as LoRa, IoT sensors may communicate
    across distances of up to 12 km with only 100 kbps data throughput and the highest
    degree of scalability (5-20K nodes). The authors of [35] have suggested a comparison
    of the performance characteristics of LPWAN technologies, including Sigfox, LoRa,
    and NB-IoT, in terms of deployment, deployment costs, battery life, latency, and
    scalability. In [36]–[37], authors have proposed a smart agriculture monitoring
    system using LoRaWAn technologies. 2) Zigbee The Zigbee protocol allows data to
    be transferred over long distances by using a mesh network of middle nodes to
    connect to remote ones. There are already about 300 million Zigbee nodes in use,
    and the 2.4 GHz frequency band of the technology can be used everywhere without
    requiring a license. If any of the nodes is disabled or removed, it autonomously
    configures itself (self-forming) and changes its configuration dynamically to
    fix itself (self-healing). Zigbee''s widespread adoption in automation and industrial
    IoT is a result of its interoperable nature, which enables seamless communication
    between devices made by numerous manufacturers. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is another
    low-power wireless connection option for sensor nodes. It supports a minimum range
    of 50 m with up to 7 nodes and a maximum data transfer speed of 1 MB/s. When compared
    to other communication technologies, the Bluetooth transceiver consumes less power.
    Beyond being the industry standard for handsfree phone and music transmission
    over wireless networks, Bluetooth technology is part of the IoT in both consumer
    and business settings. Bluetooth for the Internet of Things (Bluetooth IoT) is
    popular because it can connect devices without an internet connection on the one
    hand and build large device networks via Bluetooth mesh on the other. In [38],
    authors have proposed a localization method for smart farming based on Bluetooth
    technology. 4) Narrow Band Iot (nb-iot) A low-power wide area (LPWA) technology
    known as narrowband (NB-IoT) has provided a lot of new Internet of Things (IoT)
    devices and services. It increases system capacity and spectrum efficiency and
    reduces system power consumption. It can also extend the battery''s life to more
    than ten years. Data rates of up to 150 kbps are supported. 5) Sigfox Another
    LPWAN technology, similar to NBIoT, is Sigfox. To facilitate communication via
    the ISM radio frequencies, The modulation techniques used by Sigfox are differential
    binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) and Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK).
    In Europe and the US, Sigfox technology operates at 868 MHz and 902 MHz, respectively.
    It uses an energy-efficient signal dubbed “Ultra Narrowband” that has a wider
    range. It uses a one-hop star topology, and a mobile operator is needed to handle
    the traffic. It allows very slow data speeds of 100 bits per second. Fig. 7. Components
    of Sensor node Show All 6) Wireless Fidelity (wi-fi) Wi-Fi is an IEEE 802.11 protocol
    family designed for wireless sensor nodes where faster data transfer speeds are
    required, but power consumption is not an issue, and high data rates are required,
    such as video transmission. It supports the minimum transmission distance of 100
    feet. For IoT applications in smart agriculture, such high data rates are not
    necessary. For the Internet of Things, two Wi-Fi standards have been created:
    Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah) and HEW (802.11ax). It supports upstream rates of as much
    as 290 MB/s.. 7) Cellular The Internet of Things (IoT) is connected to the physical
    world through cellular technology, which makes use of the same cellular network
    as smartphones. Using current mobile networks, this technology enables the connection
    of IoT devices[39]. As a result, there is no longer a need to spend money and
    time creating a special network architecture, especially for IoT devices. Due
    to significant investments made in the development of cellular networks in most
    counties, mobile users always have access to reliable cellular connectivity. Connecting
    devices like streetlights, agricultural, and medical equipment with cellular networks
    like 3G, 4G/LTE, or 5G is the idea behind cellular IoT enablement. The benefits
    of cellular IoT technology are extensive coverage, cost-saving, remote management,
    security, and flexibility in connectivity. After networking components of IoT
    solutions, messaging protocols are still needed for data exchange over devices
    and the cloud. Some of the well-known protocols used in IoT ecosystems include
    the ones listed below [40]. 8) Coap CoAP is a popular client-server IoT protocol.
    Customers can use it to request online transfers as needed. But it also made it
    possible for supporting servers to respond to incoming inquiries. The device nodes
    of the IoT ecosystem can only communicate through CoAP. It was created to work
    with IoT systems that use HTTP. CoAP supports low bandwidth and resource-constrained
    devices to participate in IoT ecosystem. It is frequently used in machine-to-machine
    (M2M) applications.CoAP uses a compact binary message format for encoding requests
    and responses. The headers in CoAP messages are designed to be concise, typically
    requiring only a few bytes. This compact format reduces the amount of data transmitted
    over the network, making it ideal for low-bandwidth environments. Fig. 8. Classification
    of communication technologies used in Internet of Things (IoT) Show All 9) Dds
    Data Distribution Service is providing low-latency data connectivity, highly reliable,
    and a scalable architecture that IoT applications demand.” For data-centric communication,
    DDS is a middleware protocol and API standard. Using a publish-subscribe paradigm,
    this M2M standard delivers real-time data transport that is both high-performance
    and extremely scalable. To deliver applications with high-quality QoS, DDS uses
    multicasting and broker less architecture. 10) MQTT MQTT stands for Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport, a system that was created for the first time in 1999. This
    protocol does not currently employ message queuing. MQTT''s publish-subscribe
    architecture makes M2M communication easier. It utilizes less technology and encourages
    communication between numerous devices because of its straightforward messaging
    architecture. It is intended to operate in low-bandwidth environments. For connecting
    devices and the Internet of Things, MQTT is now the most well-liked open-source
    protocol. 11) AMQP The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is a published
    open-source standard for asynchronous wired communications. Between businesses
    and apps, AMQP offers interoperable encryption-based messaging. Client-server
    messaging and IoT device management both use this protocol. Middleware that is
    more message-oriented uses the open standard protocol known as Advanced Message
    Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It delivers interoperability, stability, and security
    even over lengthy distances and in subpar networks. It permits communication even
    when all necessary systems are not available at once. C. Choosing the Right Iot
    Protocol There is no one IoT communication protocol that is optimum or appropriate
    for all deployments. Instead, the design engineers must decide the suitable protocol
    for their organizations based on the requirement of their IoT deployments. These
    decisions should take a variety of factors into account, such as the location
    and power requirements of the connected devices, as well as the size and features
    of the area where the deployment will be located. When choosing the communication
    technology for our application, we must take into account communication range,
    Power efficiency, continuous availability, data throughput, latency, and end-user
    experience. It has been demonstrated that the LoRaWAN protocol is now being used
    more frequently. While selecting the communication technology for our application,
    we need to consider a few things. Communication Range Power Efficiency Continuous
    Availability Data Throughput and Efficiency End-user Experience D. How Sensors
    and Actuators Communicate The ESP8266 Node MCU microcontroller, the 18F458 PIC
    microcontroller, and the TMEGA328P are three common hardware platforms used by
    researchers in IoT-based smart agriculture. The majority of these platforms include
    the Wi-Fi module in it that connects to any Wi-Fi network via the TCP/IP protocol.
    These platforms are affordable, need little additional circuitry, and use less
    power. Furthermore, they have a limited amount of storage and on-board processing.
    A microcontroller logic application could be used to implement any smart watering
    technique. These systems allow for the quick integration of a variety of sensors
    across General Purpose IO (GPIO) pins in order to scale up to incorporate multiple
    sensors on a single platform. The maximum number of sensors that can be used with
    each actuator on the ATMEGA328P is 8. SECTION IV. Role of Machine Learning and
    Deep Learning in Agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes big
    data, the internet of things (IoT), machine learning, and several other digital
    technologies, is used widely in smart agriculture. [41]. Deep learning-based smart
    agriculture has seen significant success recently. The capacity of various intelligent
    systems built on AI to record, interpret, and help farmers make the best decisions
    at the right moment varies. Sensors (IoT nodes) that are installed in agricultural
    areas can record data, which can then be processed using any deep learning or
    machine learning algorithms and imposed on operational regions utilizing actuators.
    Only AI can decide when to use a specific resource appropriately, taking into
    account both the present situation and predictions for the future. By scheduling
    the appropriate amounts of resources, such as water, pesticides, and fertilizer,
    AI-based smart agriculture can reduce pollution and production costs while increasing
    output.. As early identification and prevention of plant diseases can be aided
    by AI, using fewer treatments to stop their spread would greatly lower environmental
    contamination [42]. For plant health, growth, and yield, agronomic inputs, including
    water, nutrients, and fertilizers, must be continuously provided. [43] Deep learning(DL)
    and machine learning (ML) are the two newest trends in the computer industry.
    Agriculture is monitored during the pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest stages
    using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. [44]. Crop selection, soil
    preparation, seed sowing, irrigation, and crop maintenance, which includes applying
    pesticides, spotting weeds, and trimming, are considered pre-harvesting stages
    of farming. To automate the process of estimating soil quality, several authors
    have recommended various machine learning and image recognition algorithms. [45]
    [46] seed sorting and computation [47] [48]. Some often examine tree leaves or
    branch growth to spot diseases, or they frequently use preventative measures to
    do so. Both tasks are carried out manually, and there is a possibility of mistakes.
    The type of disease, its severity, and the affected area play a major role in
    choosing the pesticide to use. Pesticides should not be applied to all crops unless
    absolutely necessary. This can be harmful to both the crops and the farmers''
    health. In [49]–[51], various authors have proposed different methodologies and
    solutions for the problems in the pre harvesting stage. Weeds are one of the factors
    that affect plant growth and productivity, just like pests and plant diseases.
    Numerous machine learning techniques have been put forth by researchers to recognize
    weeds in agricultural fields [52] [53] The most crucial stage is harvesting, which
    comes after pre-harvesting considerations for factors like soil, seeds, weeds,
    etc. are made. Fruit /Crop size, Skin color, flavor, maturation stage, quality,
    and categorization for harvesting are the crucial factors that need to be concentrated
    on at this stage. Fruit that has been harvested correctly and with care will yield
    a profit. Farmers are being helped by a variety of machine learning and deep learning
    techniques to cut down on harvesting-stage losses [54]–[58] The post-harvesting
    stage is a crucial one in agriculture and needs for extra care. Avoiding post-harvesting
    may ruin all of our efforts once the processes from seed selection to till harvesting.
    The post harvesting activities are sorting and grading, shelf life prediction.
    A study revealed that improper post-harvest handling techniques can have an impact
    on the fruit''s quality and quantity, increasing overall losses. [59] A. Challenges
    for Implementing Machine Learning in Smart Agriculture In the context of smart
    agriculture, machine learning offers a number of benefits. In contrast to the
    benefits, there are drawbacks. Some of the challenges that have been encountered
    when using machine learning algorithms in the agricultural sector are listed below:
    Pre-processing the data is step one: Before model training’ testing, and validation
    phase a data preprocessing must be require to clean the data. This could be a
    lengthy procedure. Selection machine learning algorithms: There are lots of machine
    learning algorithms are available selecting a suitable algorithm to our application
    is a tedious process. one can choose the best algorithm by comparing the results
    of various algorithms. This method of trial and error could cause the deployment
    of the model to be delayed. Machine learning model training and testing: To create
    an accurate model, a large amount of training data is required. It''s also crucial
    to test and validate models to ensure their accuracy prior its deployment. For
    the best intended and possible results, a model must be built from scratch, which
    requires extensive training and repeated testing. High-end hardware resources,
    programmers with domain expertise, testing equipment, etc. are required. Cost
    and accessibility: Implementing machine learning in agriculture should be financially
    feasible for farmers, especially small-scale farmers with limited resources. The
    cost of acquiring and maintaining the necessary hardware, software, and expertise
    can be a barrier to adoption. Ensuring affordability and accessibility of machine
    learning solutions is crucial for widespread implementation B. Iot, Ai, and Machine
    Learning in Soilless Agriculture Soilless agriculture is a method used to grow
    plants in a controlled environment without soil. In this method of agriculture,
    less amount of water and area are enough for growing crops. It provides the necessary
    nutrients for plant development artificially [60] [61]. The types of soilless
    agriculture are Hydroponics, Aquaponics and Aeroponics. In hydroponics, plants
    are grown in water-based nutritional solutions without the use of soil and with
    the assistance of mechanical support. A technique called Aquaponics allows for
    the simultaneous growth of plants and fish. Warehouses and other unconventional
    spaces can be used for aquaponics. The trash from the compartment used for fish
    farming is applied to the crops as manure. Chemical pesticides, fertilizers, or
    antibiotics are not utilized in this kind of agriculture to develop plants or
    fish. Future trends in agriculture can be enhanced by domesticating the Internet
    of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) in accordance
    with the needs of agricultural techniques like hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics..
    Traditional soilless farming has many drawbacks, including poor data sharing,
    heavy labor demands, and a lack of data centralization. Implementing the Internet
    of Things (IoT) concept in controlled environment agriculture can address these
    problems. SECTION V. Role of Blockchain in Smart Agriculture Blockchains are networks
    of computers that share a distributed database. Although it is possible to contribute
    to the database, you cannot change the data already there. The network routinely
    verifies the reliability of the database. Blockchain technology enables the creation
    of a secure way for recording transactions and delivering them to signatories
    or any other target group with an Internet connection. Fundamentally, it is a
    highly democratic ledger that cannot be altered at will and is simple to share.
    Smart decision support systems in farming help farmers make the best decisions
    to boost crop output and profits by managing data effectively. Different sensors
    and equipment used in agriculture gather various types of data about the land
    before transmitting it to a server in a cloud environment. Farmers can interact
    with the intelligent decision support system via mobile applications and websites
    to obtain information on the land from subject-matter specialists. These data
    need to be securely maintained and guarded against unwanted access because they
    are very sensitive. The Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain technology, and edge
    computing are all being integrated to help agricultural areas produce more crops
    while using fewer natural resources. A secure environment for storing and exchanging
    agricultural data is provided via a blockchain-enabled agricultural knowledge
    discovery system[62] [63] SECTION VI. Role of 5g in Smart Farming The dominance
    of 5G wireless technologies in smart agriculture is increasing day by day. This
    is due to the benefits of 5G technology, such as greater data rates and larger
    data capacities,. coverage areas, and adaptability to a variety of communication
    situations. These are critical in big farmlands for real-time crop monitoring.
    Over the last ten years, the 3G / 4G / NB-IoT wireless network technology, which
    provides appropriate speed for transmitting information and communication, has
    been utilized to connect smart devices through the IoT to share data for accurate
    evaluation in the agricultural field. However, as the quantity and quality of
    information has increased, the efficiency of the 4G network has dropped, as data
    transmission has become weaker than previously. The 5G network represents the
    evolution of fifth-generation communication networks to deliver extremely fast
    data transformation in a short period of time. Data transfer on the 5G network
    is faster than on other networks, with download and upload rates roughly 100 times
    faster than on the 4G network. The 5G networks support the design of smart applications
    because of their high data rate, low latency, spectral efficiency SECTION VII.
    Cloud Iot Challenges in Agriculture and How Edge Computing Can Solve Them It is
    impossible to overstate the advantages of IoT applications in agriculture, yet
    smart farming technologies can still face certain difficulties, particularly if
    they rely on the cloud. IoT smart farming faces three main cloud computing difficulties.
    Most use cases benefit greatly from cloud-based solutions. Another issue for the
    cloud can be data volume. Terabytes of data can be produced by widespread sensor
    deployments with frequent readings, which makes cloud storage and processing unfeasible
    and expensive. Cloud, however, is obviously not a choice for remote sites, and
    generally speaking, there are a number of circumstances where cloud must be supplemented
    with on-premises processing or storage. Edge computing expands the functionality
    of the cloud by delivering local resilience, processing, and storage to the network''s
    edge along with the infrastructure for sensing. Security There is a very high
    probability of information violation when it is sent back and forth between the
    field device and the cloud. Additionally, every sensor or device in our IoT network
    may be a potential point of weakness. In edge computing, data remains on the device
    where it was first obtained, so it helps reduce the risk of a data breach or theft.
    Speed Cloud based applications take lot of time to gather, transport, and analyse
    data. Because of this, some businesses may find themselves in a difficult situation
    where they must decide between the speed of data processing and the level of insight
    it can provide. This is especially true for remote accessing of agriculture field.
    Edge computing solves this problem by enhancing network efficiency and accelerating
    data processing, The network''s devices can all examine the data they gather and
    give quick feedback, accelerating processing and enhancing the level of understanding.
    Cost The amount of data generated by the “things” and sent across the network
    often determines how much cloud computing costs. When you consider how many devices
    a single smart farm system uses and how much data it generates, you can see how
    quickly cloud computing costs can rise. Using edge computing in agriculture eliminates
    the need to move or overcrowd your storage with irrelevant and pointless data.
    As a result, you can quickly reduce your cloud costs, including bandwidth and
    storage costs. SECTION VIII. Role of Robots in Smart Farming The Internet of Things
    (IoT) has aided in the development of agricultural robots capable of performing
    jobs that humans cannot. In addition, the robots can remove up to 80% of pesticides
    used on fields without harming the environment. With a workforce shortage, agricultural
    robots will be useful instruments for developing innovative smart agriculture
    solutions. A variety of agricultural robots, including harvesting, sowing, weed
    identification, irrigation, and insect infestation, as well as animal applications,
    are being developed. In [64] [65], the author suggests a vision-based navigation
    system for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and a binocular vision navigation
    algorithm for intelligent agricultural robots that can combine the edge contour
    and height information of crop rows in images to extract navigation parameters.
    To build a productive tomato harvesting robot, [66] combines the ideas of 3D perception,
    manipulation, and an end-effect. This robot uses deep learning to recognize tomatoes,
    then extracts the target crop''s 3D coordinates and uses 3D coordination to control
    the motion of the manipulator. SECTION IX. Open Issues and Challenges in Smart
    Agriculture Open Issues and Challenges in Smart Agriculture: AI-enabled IoT-based
    smart farming has the potential to revolutionize the agriculture industry by increasing
    efficiency, reducing waste, and improving yields. However, there are several challenges
    that need to be addressed for successful implementation. Here are some of the
    major challenges: Security Issues: There are various security issues that IoT-based
    agricultural systems must handle. Due to inadequate security, users experience
    a wide range of problems, including data loss and other on-field traits. Additionally,
    because of the low energy consumption and limited memory, it is difficult to create
    sophisticated and complex algorithms. The location-based services and IoT-enabled
    location information that are used in precision farming are vulnerable to hackers
    who might exploit them to capture devices. Cryptographic implementations are taken
    out by attacks on IoT devices. Other communication layers are similarly susceptible
    to wireless signal blocking and denial-of-service (DoS) assaults. Cost: When adopting
    IoT in agriculture, a number of costrelated issues, such as deployment and maintenance
    costs, arise. The setup costs are made up of hardware costs for gateways, base
    station infrastructure, and IoT devices and sensors. Also included in operational
    costs are continuing subscription fees for IoT device administration, information
    exchange between services, and centralized information/data collection services.
    Lack Knowledge of Technology: To make all these technological revolutions grand
    success farmers need to understand these technologies. In developing nations where
    the majority of farmers are uneducated, this issue is prevalent because extensive
    investment is needed in farmer training prior to building IoT infrastructure;
    implementing IoT in agriculture is difficult. Reliability: Due to the open environment
    in which IoT devices are used in agriculture, extreme environmental conditions
    may result in connectivity breakdowns and the humiliation of placed sensors. As
    a result, it''s critical to secure the physical security of IoT devices and sensors
    deployed so they can be shielded from harsh weather conditions. Scalability The
    agriculture industry has a huge deployment of IoT devices and sensors, so an intelligent
    IoT management system is needed to be scalable. Limitations use of drones in agriculture
    Unmanned aircraft have many advantages, but there are also several obstacles to
    their deployment, particularly in poor nations. These include the following. Because
    the drone''s flight period is limited to an hour or less, it is important to take
    into account the overlap between the flight lines while choosing the flight line
    path. Drones are expensive, especially when equipped with high-quality hardware,
    software, cameras, and thermal imaging equipment. Drone operation laws: In many
    nations, operating a drone requires a permit; also, the pilot''s height cannot
    exceed 400 feet. Climate influence: Weather conditions have an impact on how drones
    operate. The Wind and rain have an impact on the drone''s performance, so it is
    important to consider the weather before beginning any work. Smart farming generates
    a vast amount of data that needs to be collected, analyzed, and managed. This
    includes data from sensors, weather stations, soil moisture sensors, and other
    sources. Managing and processing this data in real time is a challenge that requires
    sophisticated data management techniques. Connectivity: Smart farming relies on
    IoT devices and sensors to collect and transmit data. The connectivity of these
    devices can be a challenge, especially in rural areas where network coverage may
    be limited. Power Consumption: IoT devices require power to operate, and battery
    life can be a limiting factor. The use of renewable energy sources such as solar
    power and wind power can help address this issue. Addressing these challenges
    will require collaboration between industry, government, and research institutions.
    However, the potential benefits of AI-enabled IoT-based smart farming are significant,
    including increased yields, reduced waste, and improved sustainability. SECTION
    X. How To Optimize the Performance of Smart Farming To optimize the performance
    of IoT-based smart agriculture, several strategies can be implemented. These strategies
    focus on enhancing efficiency, reliability, and scalability while reducing resource
    consumption and response time. Edge Computing: Implement edge computing to process
    data closer to the source (sensors and devices) rather than sending all data to
    centralized servers. Edge computing reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and
    allows for faster decision-making, making it ideal for time-sensitive applications
    in smart agriculture. Data Compression and Aggregation: Use data compression techniques
    to reduce the size of data transmitted over the network. Additionally, aggregate
    data from multiple sensors to minimize redundant information. This approach decreases
    data transmission requirements and conserves bandwidth, thereby reducing the energy
    consumption Energy Efficiency: Optimize power consumption of IoT devices by using
    low-power components, energy-efficient algorithms, and duty-cycling mechanisms.
    Prolonging the battery life of IoT devices reduces maintenance efforts and ensures
    continuous data collection. Optimized Network Topology: Design the IoT network
    topology strategically to minimize communication hops and improve overall network
    performance. This can be achieved through network clustering or using mesh networks
    to ensure robust connectivity. Quality of Service (QoS): Prioritize critical data
    and applications in the IoT network to ensure high QoS for essential services.
    Allocate resources accordingly to guarantee that vital processes, such as irrigation
    control or weather monitoring, receive priority handling. Security and Privacy
    Measures: Implement robust security protocols to safeguard IoT devices and data
    from unauthorized access. Protecting the integrity and privacy of agricultural
    data is crucial, especially when it involves sensitive information about crops,
    livestock, or farmers. Predictive Analytics and AI: Utilize machine learning algorithms
    to analyze historical data and predict future events, such as weather patterns,
    crop yield, and pest outbreaks. Predictive analytics helps optimize resource allocation
    and enhances decision-making for farmers. Fault Tolerance and Redundancy: Design
    the system with redundancy and fault-tolerance mechanisms to handle device failures
    gracefully. Ensuring that critical processes can continue in case of device malfunctions
    or network disruptions enhances system reliability. Sustainable Resource Management:
    Use IoT data to optimize resource usage, such as water, fertilizers, and energy.
    By employing precision agriculture techniques, farmers can reduce waste and promote
    sustainable practices. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuously monitor
    the performance of the IoT-based smart agriculture system and gather feedback
    from users. Regular evaluations help identify areas for improvement and enable
    iterative enhancements. SECTION XI. Conclusion In this paper, we discuss the necessity
    of smart farming to satisfy current food demand and availability. A detailed review
    of existing methods and a recent development in smart agriculture systems were
    discussed. The significant contributions of this paper are the applications of
    IoT in agriculture, the hardware requirements of smart agriculture systems, the
    various wireless communication technologies available and their comparison, the
    role of machine learning in smart farming, and their challenges. We then discussed
    the future technologies for smart farming and social development when society
    fully adopts smart farming. An intelligent IoT system for smart farming can begin
    reducing the need for water, soil, and human resources while increasing food production.
    However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed for successful
    implementation. Data management, connectivity, power consumption, data privacy,
    and security, cost, and farmer education and training are some of the major challenges
    that need to be overcome. By addressing these challenges and embracing new technologies,
    the agriculture industry can meet the increasing demand for food in a sustainable
    and efficient manner. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

  description: In today’s digital age, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining popularity.
    IoT has made everything smart, for example, smart cities (smart buildings and
    smart homes), smart healthcare (personal monitoring, smart wearables), industrial
    automation (especially manufacturing), commercial (shopping systems, retail),
    and even that agriculture too. IoT is becoming increasingly important in today’s
    digital age, resulting in a rapid rise in the number of devices connected to it.
    Massive amounts of data will be produced by such widely distributed IoT devices
    at the network’s edge. Processing these massive amounts of data in the centralized
    cloud is expected to result in increased 400bandwidth utilization, latency, and
    network congestion. Edge computing has become a popular paradigm in recent years
    for reducing network congestion and serving real-time IoT applications by providing
    services close to enduser devices. Agriculture is the foundation of the economy
    of any nation in the world. By 2050, the world population will need a 70% increase
    in food production to feed an estimated global population of more than 9 billion
    people. Potatoes are consumed all over the world and its production plays an important
    role in agriculture. The two primary diseases that adversely affect the yield
    of potato crop production are early blight and late blight. Therefore, in this
    work, we used containerized microservices to deploy machine learning models to
    resource restricted edge nodes on agricultural land for real-time disease and
    irrigation water requirement prediction in potato crops. Containers are lightweight
    and easy to deploy, making them the ideal choice for running machine learning
    models on resource-constrained edge nodes. We examined AlexNet, MobileNet, and
    VGG16, three deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), to detect these diseases
    automatically. A dataset of 7128 images containing healthy and diseased leaves
    of potato plants was used to train all three CNN models on the cloud. Even if
    training is outsourced, trained models need a lot of RAM; hence, the first aim
    of this study is to find a lightweight CNN model that can easily fit into resource-constrained
    devices. To improve potato crop yield and reduce economic losses, we found and
    deployed lightweight CNN model at the edge node to identify diseases in real time
    using leaf pictures recorded by in-place camera devices. The advantage of the
    developed technique is that by classifying potato leaf pictures in real time on-premises,
    there is no need to transfer images to the cloud for probable disease identification,
    which increases network congestion. The lightweight CNN model achieved 99.87%
    accuracy for both train and test images, according to the results. Precision (P),
    Recall (R), and F1 score (F1) are also displayed, to visualize the model’s efficiency.
    Similarly for real-time prediction of irrigation water requirement in potato crop,
    we trained two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic
    Regression (LR) on 100,000 values of records. Each record has four input parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and how many days the crop was planted

    9781003435228 Share ABSTRACT In today’s digital age, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    is gaining popularity. IoT has made everything smart, for example, smart cities
    (smart buildings and smart homes), smart healthcare (personal monitoring, smart
    wearables), industrial automation (especially manufacturing), commercial (shopping
    systems, retail), and even that agriculture too. IoT is becoming increasingly
    important in today’s digital age, resulting in a rapid rise in the number of devices
    connected to it. Massive amounts of data will be produced by such widely distributed
    IoT devices at the network’s edge. Processing these massive amounts of data in
    the centralized cloud is expected to result in increased 400bandwidth utilization,
    latency, and network congestion. Edge computing has become a popular paradigm
    in recent years for reducing network congestion and serving real-time IoT applications
    by providing services close to enduser devices. Agriculture is the foundation
    of the economy of any nation in the world. By 2050, the world population will
    need a 70% increase in food production to feed an estimated global population
    of more than 9 billion people. Potatoes are consumed all over the world and its
    production plays an important role in agriculture. The two primary diseases that
    adversely affect the yield of potato crop production are early blight and late
    blight. Therefore, in this work, we used containerized microservices to deploy
    machine learning models to resource restricted edge nodes on agricultural land
    for real-time disease and irrigation water requirement prediction in potato crops.
    Containers are lightweight and easy to deploy, making them the ideal choice for
    running machine learning models on resource-constrained edge nodes. We examined
    AlexNet, MobileNet, and VGG16, three deep convolutional neural networks (CNN),
    to detect these diseases automatically. A dataset of 7128 images containing healthy
    and diseased leaves of potato plants was used to train all three CNN models on
    the cloud. Even if training is outsourced, trained models need a lot of RAM; hence,
    the first aim of this study is to find a lightweight CNN model that can easily
    fit into resource-constrained devices. To improve potato crop yield and reduce
    economic losses, we found and deployed lightweight CNN model at the edge node
    to identify diseases in real time using leaf pictures recorded by in-place camera
    devices. The advantage of the developed technique is that by classifying potato
    leaf pictures in real time on-premises, there is no need to transfer images to
    the cloud for probable disease identification, which increases network congestion.
    The lightweight CNN model achieved 99.87% accuracy for both train and test images,
    according to the results. Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1 score (F1) are also
    displayed, to visualize the model’s efficiency. Similarly for real-time prediction
    of irrigation water requirement in potato crop, we trained two machine learning
    models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) on 100,000 values
    of records. Each record has four input parameters (soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and how many days the crop was planted before). With four input parameters
    in each record (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and how many days before
    the crop was planted), the model decides whether the water pump should be turned
    on or off. The SVM model and the LR model attained 92 and 73% accuracy, respectively,
    in determining whether the water pump should be turned ON or OFF. Previous Chapter

    is edge computing, which provides cloud-like capabilities at the edge of the network
    by pushing storage and processing capabilities from centralized nodes to edge
    devices that are closer to where the data are gathered, resulting in reduced network
    delays [2], [3]. The most common machine learning approach used in cloud-based
    applications is Centralized Learning (Fig. 1a) where datasets from different clients
    are sent to a central cloud for storage and to train a machine learning model.
    A model trained in this centralized manner is potentially the most accurate model
    as it has been trained on all of the datasets. However, centralized training introduces
    challenges associated with transferring data to the cloud, such as data privacy
    and communication overheads. Conversely, Local Learning is an alternative where
    we train the machine learning models directly on the devices where the data are
    hosted using their own local computing resources (Fig. 1b), Since data are not
    shared among clients or with the server, local learning solves the privacy and
    communication overhead issues of centralized learning. However, local learning
    alone can struggle with machine learning bias. This is an emergent problem since
    data at these devices are often non-independent and identically distributed (iid).
    For instance, many data patterns sensors collect are geographically-related. Thus,
    sensors from different locations will likely collect different types of data.
    Learning independently can result in models that do not generalize well which
    can afflict the knowledge extraction across the entire system. A third alternative
    is to apply the recent Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for distributed learning
    (Fig. 1c). FL is a distributed machine learning technique that enables multiple
    clients (e.g., mobile devices, IoT devices) to collaboratively train a shared
    global model without needing their raw data transmitted to the cloud. Instead,
    local models are trained on each client using their own data, similar to local
    learning. Where FL diverges from local learning is that the server will periodically
    collect model updates from the client devices and “average” them to update the
    global model, which is then redistributed to the client devices for further training.
    FL has shown to work well in the face of non-iid data distributions which are
    common in sensor applications. Therefore, FL is a promising solution for several
    challenges associated with decentralized machine learning, such as data privacy,
    communication efficiency, scalability, data unavailability or heterogeneity, system
    heterogeneity in terms of computation power, storage, and energy availability,
    computation efficiency, and better model performance [4], [5]. Standard FL may
    incur high communication costs as the model updates need to be shared with the
    central server, creating an interesting trade-off when considering that centralized
    training requires that all data be shared with the central server (Fig. 2a). In
    cases where the communication between the sensors and the central server is very
    poor (i.e., low data transfer rate, unreliable connection), this can be a significant
    challenge. Such overhead can affect individual sensor life and the overall performance
    of the application, especially if the sensor application has power constraints
    and limited connectivity [6]. One possible solution is to expand the infrastructure
    and use hierarchical FL. Under hierarchical FL, there are additional aggregation
    nodes that may have stronger connections to the nearby sensors. These aggregation
    nodes also participate in additional levels of aggregation to make sure knowledge
    is learned throughout the entire system. Hierarchical FL overcomes some of these
    issues by allowing data to remain on the edge devices, such as sensors and smart
    devices. It enables optimization of computational and communication overheads
    that can be customized to suit the needs of specific applications and networks.
    Fig. 1. Comparison of (a) Centralized, (b) Local, and (c) Federated learning architectures.
    Federated learning enables collaborative learning among multiple edge devices
    without compromising data privacy. Centralized learning relies on a central server
    to train a global model on data from all devices, while local learning trains
    multiple local models on disjoint subsets of data. Show All Fig. 2. Illustration
    of (a) Standard federated learning (FL) and (b) Hierarchical federated learning
    and their interaction between lot devices, edge and cloud servers. The aggregation
    nodes are where the local model updates from the participating devices or intermediary
    nodes are combined to form a global model. Show All Different approaches of hierarchical
    FL can be employed by making use of available networking hubs and structures,
    such as a cloud server that is accessed over the internet and an edge server,
    which is a computer server that is located closer to the devices that it serves
    at the network edge (Fig. 2b). One option is to aggregate models within a cloud
    server, while other options can involve hierarchical aggregation at the edge server
    which sends the model updates to the cloud for further aggregation or storage.
    This allows local processing power and storage capacity to perform distributed
    learning without relying solely on a central server, resulting in improved scalability,
    reduced latency and privacy preservation of sensitive data. While hierarchical
    FL has shown potential in various domains, including precision agriculture and
    environmental monitoring, [4] points out that very few production FL applications
    have been reported, with most work being proof-of-concept prototypes. The paradigm
    itself is relatively new and its implementation requires careful consideration
    of various issues such as data inequality [7], [8] and malicious attacks [9]–[11].
    Another important challenge to overcome with FL is the cost of adoption and the
    incentives to incorporate FL into existing systems. In FL, devices must contribute
    their computational resources and data to train a model. However, some organizations
    may be reluctant to participate in a large FL endeavor due to the computational
    resources needed to participate and data transfer and communication costs. Furthermore,
    there may not be the right incentives to join if a benefit from the global model''s
    performance is not properly recognized. For example, an industry leader may be
    less incentivized to adopt multi-organizational FL if they are already the primary
    source of data as their marginal benefit would be significantly lower. To address
    these challenges, various methods have been proposed to incentivize participation
    in FL. These methods include providing monetary or non-monetary rewards for contributing
    data, ensuring that the global model''s performance benefits all participants,
    and providing greater control over the use of data by participants. For example,
    [12] proposed a reward-based mechanism that provides tokens to devices that contribute
    data to the FL model, which can then be used to purchase services or products.
    Authors in [13] propose a privacy-preserving FL model that allows participants
    to retain control over their data and provides incentives for contributing high-quality
    data. In this article, we present a case study of the feasibility and benefits
    of FL for precision agricultural spraying and extend it to a larger conceptual
    hierarchical FL architecture for smart farming. We also discuss ongoing efforts
    to improve hierarchical FL systems using standardized quality frameworks to systematically
    identify and prioritize the efforts. Finally, we cover open problems associated
    with this technology and highlight its potential to transform numerous domains
    such as precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and smart
    infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a roadmap for further development of hierarchical
    FL in instrumentation and measurement. Federated Learning for Precision Spraying
    In the previous section, we discussed the different types of learning architectures
    that can be applied to edge devices. In this section, we present a case study
    involving precision spraying in agriculture (Fig. 3) to highlight the benefits
    of FL. Traditional spraying methods often apply pesticides uniformly across an
    entire field, leading to waste and potential harm to crops. In contrast, precision
    spraying uses cameras, optical sensors, and GPS receivers to provide accurate
    location data, enabling robots to apply spray only where necessary. However, the
    advanced data processing and machine learning required for precision spraying
    can be resource-intensive, making it challenging to perform all operations on
    the sensor or robot alone. Data collected from sensors can be processed using
    cloud computing relying on connectivity, but this can be a challenge in remote
    environments. By relying on computational resources at the edge server, data can
    be processed in real-time or limited-time to accelerate the decision-making process.
    FL can further improve spray precision by enabling learning from different data
    sources (e.g., across different locations with different distributions of plant/weed
    species) while preserving data privacy and security. This is particularly important
    for farmers who are concerned about data privacy and potential cyberattacks. Furthermore,
    FL can be flexibly performed on a network of edge devices potentially of different
    types, which can scale up or down to meet the needs of different agricultural
    operations, making it a valuable tool for precision spraying. Fig. 3. Precision
    spraying prototype using edge federated learning. Show All In this feasibility
    study, we limit the discussion to a single source of information, which is a near-infrared
    hyperspectral imaging system that is used to guide the operations of a mobile
    precision pesticide spraying robot at each of the three pasture sites (Site A,
    B and C). Each robot processes the input information using a local machine learning
    model (e.g., an image classifier implemented by a Convolutional Neural Network).
    The intent is to have the robot apply spray to a plant only if the plant is classified
    as a weed, ensuring minimal impact on crops. Storing a machine learning model
    locally ensures that spray operations can continue in areas without network coverage.
    Although the local model is trained using local data (∼71 Megabytes), it periodically
    receives updates (∼0.04 Megabytes) from the server via FL to incorporate knowledge
    learned from other pasture sites. With FL, communication is significantly reduced
    from 71 Megabytes to 0.04 Megabytes. Different forms of computation resources
    reside in each pasture site, with the model potentially being trained on the robot
    using single-board computational devices such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
    The locally-trained models from each pasture site are then aggregated using Federated
    Averaging [14], a popular aggregation algorithm in FL. The pasture sites are interconnected
    using communication infrastructure for sharing information and enabling FL. The
    dataset used during our evaluation consisted of four labelled classes: three species
    of pastoral weed and a background class of grass (Table 1). The evaluation results
    for our case study with different machine learning methods are shown in Fig. 4,
    whereby FL achieves 96% accuracy. This result is comparable to centralized learning
    where all the data are present, and a marked improvement compared to local learning
    where only local data are present. Our result confirms that FL is capable of addressing
    the dilemma between network latency, bandwidth limitations, data privacy and data
    sharing while providing comparable model performance. Table 1 Pasture Image dataset
    with imbalanced class distributions and disparate volumes of data across sites
    A Hierarchical Federated Learning Architecture for Smart Farrning We now consider
    broadening the precision spraying use case to a larger conceptual hierarchical
    FL architecture for smart farming. Precision agriculture often involves gathering
    heterogeneous data from various sensors within a farm. By leveraging FL, farmers
    can benefit from insights gained from other farms without compromising the privacy
    of their own raw data. This will enable them to enhance crop yields and minimize
    wastage. Fig. 5 illustrates the physical, cyber and networked (interconnected)
    view of a precision agriculture robot at work. Fig. 5a shows the “physical world”
    where the robot has sensors on board and navigates to perform tasks such as harvesting,
    weeding, and spraying. Fig. 5b represents the “cyber world” where the robot processes
    input information from its sensors using a local machine learning model to perform
    high priority tasks that must continue even when the communication fails (i.e.,
    navigation). The robot also monitors the quality of service for communication
    and decides whether to pass on further information or receive information from
    the cloud. Fig. 5c is the “interconnected world” where a group of robots is connected
    via a communication infrastructure for FL to share knowledge and improve their
    respective local machine learning models based on collective learned experiences.
    The types of sensor systems used for smart farming are heterogeneous. For example,
    a smart farm may rely heavily on IoT sensors and cameras to collect and process
    data related to soil quality and plant visual information. Additionally, smart
    farms may use multiple data sources to optimize farming operations. These data
    sources may include historical data, real-time sensor data, and publicly available
    data to predict soil water levels and future weather patterns with machine learning
    models. Fig. 6 illustrates an example of a hierarchical FL architecture for smart
    farming to train lightweight machine learning models on edge devices. Fig. 4.

    of a hierarchical federated learning architecture for smart farming. Show All
    In this example, the architecture uses Apache Kafka, a popular distributed event
    streaming platform. Kafka is used to collect data from IoT devices and sensors
    located at the edge of the network, enabling real-time processing and response
    to changing conditions. Instead of waiting for large amounts of data to be collected
    and sent to a remote, central server, data streaming enables the sensor devices
    to transmit the local models to the edge servers in real-time—thus reducing latency
    and facilitating more efficient use of available network bandwidth. Hierarchical
    FL allows for adaptive clustering of the edge devices involved in the FL process,
    whereby groups of devices can be divided into smaller clusters for the training
    depending on device availability, scalability and power requirements. By making
    use of Kafka clusters to facilitate communication between the edge devices and
    the FL framework, fault tolerance can be incorporated with multiple brokers running
    on different machines to ensure high availability and data replication. FuncX
    [15] is a federated function-as-a-service platform that enables computation, represented
    as programming functions, to be dispatched for execution on edge resources. FuncX
    is used here to manage the deployment of the machine learning models to the edge
    devices and to invoke the models for inference and training. FuncX uses the Parsl
    [16] parallel programming library to manage the parallel execution of the FL tasks
    on edge devices. It is worth noting that this simple architecture can be easily
    extended to include heterogeneous resources such as Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetsons
    with GPUs, which can be deployed near the sensors for more local data processing.
    This introduces interesting research questions on the implicit trade-offs related
    to such system heterogeneity. Overall, using a hierarchical FL architecture for
    edge devices has the potential to revolutionize smart farming by enabling more
    efficient and effective data sharing, processing and decision-making, resulting
    in improved crop yields and reduced water waste. It is also resilient against
    issues such as unreliable network connectivity, which is an important consideration
    as limited network coverage is commonly encountered in agricultural land. Similar
    architectures can be developed for other applications such as: Environmental monitoring:
    Hierarchical FL could enable better analysis of data collected from remote sensors
    and devices, leading to better understanding and management of natural resources.
    Healthcare: Medical sites can collaborate and share machine learning models to
    improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment without having to share sensitive
    patient information. Wearable monitoring devices: IoT devices are integrated into
    devices to monitor human biometric data such as heart rate, temperature and movement
    patterns aiming to identify potential safety hazards and improve worker safety
    in the hazardous work environment. Application Requirements for Hierarchical Federated
    Learning Hierarchical FL systems have great potential to realize new sensor-driven
    applications, as discussed in the previous section. However, the technology faces
    numerous challenges due to the diverse nature of these applications and the equally
    diverse performance requirements. Some of these requirements can conflict with
    one another. To address the needs of these systems systematically, we recommend
    using two widely recognized standards for software quality and data quality, which
    are the ISO/IEC 25012 [17] and ISO/IEC 25010 [18] frameworks, respectively. By
    applying these frameworks, we can identify and prioritize the requirements, design
    appropriate performance metrics, and develop techniques and algorithms that optimize
    the trade-offs between conflicting requirements. This will help ensure that hierarchical
    FL systems are reliable, efficient, and effective and can be deployed in a wide
    range of real-world applications. Functionality is a crucial metric that measures
    the system''s ability to perform consistently and accurately over time. This metric
    is closely related to data quality since poor-quality data can result in unreliable
    and inaccurate machine learning models. Optimizing hierarchical FL parameters,
    applying model personalization and transfer learning techniques, and adapting
    the models to the specific characteristics of each device can help improve functionality.
    Reliability is important for edge devices, which often operate under intermittent
    connectivity, mobility, and resource-constrained conditions [19]. These challenges
    can make it difficult to develop efficient and reliable FL systems. To overcome
    these challenges, researchers are exploring techniques such as task offloading
    [20], adaptive sampling [21], and reinforcement learning to optimize the system
    performance and adapt to changing edge computing environments [22]. Redundancy
    can be introduced by configuring the edge devices into different clusters, which
    may improve reliability in hierarchical FL. Performance efficiency can be evaluated
    by quantifying the computation and communication overheads. In hierarchical FL
    systems, the edge server acts as a coordinator, responsible for aggregating and
    processing the data from multiple edge devices [23]. This can create a huge computationaland
    communication burden on the edge server, which can result in high latency, reduced
    system performance, and increased communication costs. To mitigate these challenges,
    researchers are exploring techniques such as partitioning and scheduling to distribute
    the computation and communication load across multiple edge servers and among
    cloud and edge servers [6]. The use of data streaming techniques helps to further
    reduce communication overheads while also increasing the reliability of the edge
    systems. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, mobility, and varying edge
    computing environments, engineers should consider metrics like system scalability,
    cost/benefit balance, and application size on the edge device to evaluate resource
    utilization. Techniques like task offloading, adaptive sampling, and reinforcement
    learning can further optimize system performance and adapt to changing edge computing
    environments. The convergence rate of the learning process is also a critical
    consideration. Compatibility is essential in terms of device heterogeneity, where
    edge devices may not have the same type of sensors and may run on different operating
    systems and software. Edge devices used in FL systems may differ in terms of their
    hardware capabilities, such as CPU processing power, memory, and battery life,
    as well as their software configurations, such as operating systems and libraries.
    This heterogeneity can lead to statistical heterogeneity in the data collected
    from the devices, making it challenging to develop models that generalize well
    across all devices [24]. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring
    methods such as transfer learning [25] and model personalization [26] that can
    adapt the models to the specific characteristics of each device. Security is a
    significant concern for hierarchical FL systems. FL provides some level of privacy,
    but to protect data and models from malicious actors, techniques like secure aggregation,
    differential privacy, blockchain, and homomorphic encryption can be applied. Hierarchical
    FL systems may have edge servers from different sources, which makes the systems
    more vulnerable to security threats such as data leakage, model poisoning, and
    inference attacks [23]. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring
    techniques such as secure aggregation [27], differential privacy [28], and homomorphic
    encryption [29] to ensure that the data and models are protected from malicious
    actors. Metrics like confidentiality, currentness, and reliability can be used
    to evaluate the severity of security challenges, as defined by the ISO/IEC 25010
    standard for data security and accessibility. Dynamic infrastructure is a common
    problem in hierarchical FL systems. In these settings, the aggregation nodes are
    not necessarily static or fixed. It may be necessary for the aggregation node
    to change over time if a node is rendered offline due to low battery or a poor
    communication channel. This makes ensuring stable hierarchical FL difficult. Strategies
    to prevent this can be resource-aware real-time decision making where edge devices
    coordinate among themselves to decide how communication should be done among them.
    Software support: Currently, common FL frameworks (e.g., Flower, PySyft) do not
    natively support hierarchical FL, especially for highly dynamic systems where
    infrastructure may change over time. Opportunities and Open Problems The opportunities
    and future research directions for using FL for sensing and measurement can be
    organized into three key axes: resource management and coordination of devices
    that make up the FL system; data management and access; and application-specific
    considerations, such as the use of UAVs [30] and Internet of Medical Things [23].
    In this section, we elaborate on the first two axes, which have general applicability
    across different domains. The third is highly domain-specific and thus not included
    in this general roadmap. Resource Management and Coordination FL opens up new
    methods for supporting fault tolerance of IoT devices. The use of multiple IoT
    devices increases the completeness of data and facilitates the detection and correction
    of erroneous readings and faulty operations. An FL system capable of supporting
    multiple heterogeneous devices and able to recover from faults is reported in
    [31]. A hierarchical FLsystem able to account for the hierarchy of edge servers
    may result in multiple memberships for IoT devices requiring recovery and adaptation
    at several levels. Another exciting direction is the integration of self-adaptivity
    into IoT devices using hierarchical FL. IoT devices become self-adaptive by learning
    from their past behaviors and performance data, can detect changes in environmental
    conditions and predict equipment failure, and automatically adjust device parameters
    [32]. As IoT devices collect knowledge about their environment, they must share
    knowledge to better understand their environment and its dynamics. However, a
    collective system of self-aware devices does not have a centralized knowledge
    base. FL could facilitate sharing of knowledge between devices as a collective.
    Unlike context-aware systems, which typically assume a ground-truth-based environmental
    context that is true for all IoT devices, it is explicitly acknowledged that self-aware
    devices in the collective systems will have different experiences of a shared
    environment [33]. A federated system can be expanded to incorporate information
    for the edge servers at the membership level to provide self-adaptiveness for
    different branches of the edge computing infrastructure and provide context on
    how the information was gathered. Hierarchical FL architectures are inherently
    resilient against network latency and bandwidth limitations. They therefore open
    up new opportunities for network optimization due to the heterogeneity of edge
    environments. For example, network routing needs to be dynamically adapted and
    optimized to the traffic patterns and topologies to improve network throughput
    and latency. Meanwhile, new network designs and paradigms can be introduced, such
    as software-defined networking and blockchain. New algorithms and techniques that
    are specifically designed to optimize resource allocation in edge computing environments
    can dynamically allocate computational and communication resources to different
    tasks based on their priority and application-specific requirements. This allows
    for real-time balancing of multiple objectives. For example, a healthcare application
    that uses a large number of medical sensors to collect, adapt, and react to medical
    information in real time requires security robustness and resource optimization
    for computational and communication tasks [34]. The energy consumption of IoT
    devices and edge computing infrastructure can be optimized by dynamically adapting
    the computational workload and communication overhead to the available energy
    and power constraints. Exploring multi-objective optimization techniques such
    as evolutionary algorithms and Pareto optimization is another direction of research
    that is crucial due to the complexity of hierarchical FL systems. There is a need
    to balance multiple objectives and constraints, such as communication overhead,
    energy consumption, privacy preservation, and security, while creating a global
    machine learning model with limited and heterogeneous resources. This requires
    the coordination of multiple clients and servers at different layers of the system,
    creating a complex interaction network. Additionally, the underlying technologies
    used, such as wireless communication, data storage and processing, and machine
    learning algorithms, introduce their sets of constraints and trade-offs that need
    to be considered in the optimization process, where not only performance but scalability
    needs careful consideration when optimizing these conflicting objectives. Fig.
    7. Future directions for hierarchical federated learning in sensor applications.
    Show All Data Management and Access While FL adds a layer of privacy around user
    data by eliminating the need to share data with others, sharing model updates
    do not offer privacy guarantees as individual data points can be reconstructed
    [35]. To address this issue, privacy-preserving FL can be expanded using techniques
    such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, digital signature, and hash
    functions [23], [36]. These techniques enable FL in edge computing environments
    while preserving the privacy of data and participants. For instance, differential
    privacy provides privacy guarantees for medical image analysis. In unstable edge
    computing environments, such as smart healthcare, a privacy protection scheme
    is proposed that provides gradient privacy and resistance to collusion and replay
    attacks for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) [23]. A privacy protection technique
    for a hierarchical FL system needs to be computationally efficient and adaptable
    to the underlying learning algorithms, with an ability to effectively scale to
    a large number of clients and servers. Fig. 7 summarizes some of the opportunities
    presented by hierarchical FL that make it an exciting area of research for engineers
    and academicians in the field of instrumentation and measurement. Conclusion Electrical
    and Electronics Engineers have a critical role to play in driving technological
    advancements to address global challenges and advance the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015. Hierarchical federated
    learning is an emerging technology that enhances the intelligence of sensor systems
    in many applications such as environmental quality management, personalized health-care
    devices, and precision agriculture. Secure, resilient, and robust sensor systems
    that support real-time, data-driven decision-making are valuable infrastructure
    for helping us reduce carbon emissions (SDG 13–Climate Action), promote sustainable
    urbanization (SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities), and improve healthcare
    outcomes (SDG 3–Health and Well-being). We urge researchers and practitioners
    to collaborate on the opportunities and open problems presented in this article
    to realize the full potential of this technology. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research

    The nursery and greenhouse industry contributes nearly $14 billion in annual sales
    to the U.S. economy [1]. This industry produces more than 2000 ornamental plant
    species, covering most of the U.S.’ ornamental plants [2]. Nurseries are, in general,
    open-air operations where plants grow in the ground or in containers [3]. Greenhouses
    are typically enclosed environments where growth conditions (e.g., lighting, temperature,
    humidity, and irrigation) can be controlled [4]. Rapidly increasing production
    cost due to the increased labor expense, difficulty in obtaining skilled labor,
    and inappropriate application of agricultural resources are rising concerns for
    the ornamental industry [5,6]. Operations such as planting, growing, and harvesting
    nursery crops are heavily dependent on labor. These operations account for 43%
    of total production expenses [7]. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the
    industry to obtain such labor, especially the skilled workforce required to grow
    ornamental crops [8]. Conventional practices apply agricultural resources (such
    as water, nutrients, fertilizers, and pesticides) excessively and inefficiently,
    increasing production costs. These conventional approaches not only increase the
    production cost but are also responsible for contaminating the environment and
    the ecosystem. The industry must look for alternative solutions, such as automated
    crop management technologies, to reduce labor needs and ensure the efficient use
    of crop production resources. In the current decade, sensing and automation technologies
    have been continually increasing their impact on different crop management operations
    [9,10,11,12,13]. These technologies are categorized into two groups: ground-based
    and aerial-based. Ground-based crop harvesting technologies have been tested on
    various crops, including sweet pepper [14], lettuce [15], tomato [16], strawberries
    [11], apples [9], and cherries [17]. Ground-based technologies have also been
    explored widely in automatic disease detection in different crops, such as: powdery
    mildew on strawberry leaves [18]; leaf blotch, stripe rust, powdery mildew, leaf
    rust, black chaff, and smut on wheat leaves [19]; Alternaria leaf spot, brown
    spot, mosaic, grey spot and rust on apple leaves [20]; and anthracnose, brown
    spot, mites, black rot, downy mildew, and leaf blight on grape leaves [10]. Recent
    evolutions in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show the potential of using them
    in different agricultural operations, thereby consuming less time than ground-based
    systems [12]. Until now, UAVs used for agriculture have been limited to only remote
    sensing applications, due to limited payload capacity and battery life. UAVs have
    been used in various crop management applications, including automatic canker
    disease monitoring in citrus [21], weed detection in wheat and oat fields [22],
    detecting and mapping tree seedlings and individual plants [23,24], and yield
    estimation in cotton [25]. However, the success of sensing and automation technologies
    largely depends on the types of sensors used to acquire crop data and the processing
    algorithms used to extract valuable information. Various sensors, such as soil
    moisture, temperature and humidity sensors, cameras (color, spectral, and infrared),
    together with computer algorithms are used to develop smart technologies for agricultural
    applications [5,18,21,26]. A prototype irrigation controller system was developed
    using nine soil moisture sensors on an IoT platform to automatically manage water
    application in crops [26]. You et al. [27] used an RGB-D camera system to develop
    an autonomous robot for pruning branches of sweet cherry trees. It should be noted
    that RGB-D cameras offer four channels (i.e., red, green, blue and depth) that
    were required to estimate the size of branches (by depth channel) to decide which
    ones need to prune. Abdulridha et al. [21] detected citrus disease at an early
    stage using a hyperspectral camera. Other cameras may not be suitable for detecting
    a particular disease at the asymptomatic stage. Liu et al. [28] used enhanced
    generative adversarial networks (GANs) to augment their data for grape leaf disease
    detection; other machine-learning models were not considered because of the requirement
    for a deeper network. In conclusion, identifying appropriate sensors and developing
    algorithms are necessary tasks that depend mainly on crop and soil characteristics
    and operational needs. In most cases, one automated technology is specific to
    one particular operation in a specific crop. Therefore, evaluating sensor and
    algorithm performances for different crops in a certain industry provide insights
    for choosing them generally, while developing technology for a particular production
    operation. Although the ornamental crop industry is in the initial phase of developing
    sensing and automation technologies, an overview of currently available technologies
    and prospects of advanced technologies utilized for other crop industries (for
    agronomic crops and tree fruits industry) will be helpful for future technology
    developments. 1.1. Scope of the Study A few of the available reviews for ornamental
    crops mainly reviewed water management technologies and barriers to technology
    adoption [6,29]. Lea-Cox et al. [29] studied the economic benefit, current and
    future challenges, and support issues of using wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    for water management of ornamental crops. Rihn et al. [6] reviewed factors correlated
    with the nursery industry’s propensity to use automation and mechanization. Their
    study also discussed the barriers to adoption for currently available automated
    technologies. This review aims to cover available sensing and automation technologies
    used for ornamental crop production operations, along with the prospects of using
    some advanced technologies (used in other crop industries) that can be beneficial
    to this industry. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first review article
    that broadly discusses sensing and automation technologies for ornamental crops.
    1.2. Paper Organization This review aims to discuss the status and challenges
    of sensing and automation technologies for the ornamental crop industry. The organization
    of this article is as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of sensing and automation
    technologies used for ornamental crops. In Section 3, advanced technologies used
    for other cropping systems are discussed that could be valuable for developing
    future technologies for ornamental crops. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the overall
    discussion and conclusion of the article. 2. Sensing and Automation Technologies
    for Ornamental Crops Sensing and automation technologies are used in different
    operations relating to ornamental nursery crop production. The major operations
    are smart irrigation, plant stress detection, smart or variable-rate spraying,
    and plant biometrics measurements (Figure 1). This section presents detailed reviews
    of the currently applied sensing and automation technologies for those operations.
    The technologies have also been used in a few other areas and represented as other
    significant works. Figure 1. Areas where sensing and automation technologies are
    used for ornamental crop production. 2.1. Smart Irrigation Smart or precision
    irrigation technology determines the water requirement of crops using set-point
    control (using soil moisture data) or model-based control (using crop and environmental
    data) to maximize irrigation efficiency [4,29]. It helps reduce excessive water
    application while maintaining crop growth and development. Sensors-based irrigation
    technologies have been tested in different nurseries, including greenhouse, container,
    pot-in-pot, and field nurseries [30,31,32,33,34]. A schematic diagram of a smart
    irrigation system is presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. A schematic of an IoT-based
    smart irrigation system for water management in a container-based nursery. Table
    1 presents different sensor applications for automatic irrigation management in
    different nurseries. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) were used to control irrigation
    water flow in three container-based nurseries [32]. Experiments were conducted
    in two phases: first, EM50R nodes with EC-5 sensors were used to monitor soil
    moisture; and second, nR5 nodes were used to monitor and control irrigation. The
    WSNs-based technology reduced water use by about 20% to 25%. Kim et al. [35] tested
    soil moisture and EC sensors to monitor and automatically implement irrigation
    protocols. Substrate moisture data were measured to reduce water usage of hydrangea
    by as much as 83%. Coates et al. [36] used a VH400 (Vegetronix, Sandy, UT, USA)
    sensor to monitor soil water content in container nurseries where pots contain
    hydrangea plants. Even though the VH400 sensor costs half as much as standard
    EC-5 sensors, the authors concluded the VH400 was unsuitable for nursery crop
    monitoring because its output varied by up to 29%. This type of sensor (VH400)
    shows a high sensitivity of ~34 mV rather than ~5 mV using EC-5 per % volumetric
    water content. Lea-Cox et al. [31] used a hybrid system consisting of a 12-node
    CMU network (developed by Carnegie Mellon University, United States) and Decagon
    Ech20 moisture sensors (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) to control water
    applications in real-time in a container nursery. The system was also tested in
    a greenhouse where a six-node CMU network was used. The results reported that
    both networks performed well, but encountered some networking challenges at remote
    sites. The authors noted the CMU network node is less costly than the commercial
    Decagon Ech20 sensor, but showed similar performance. Wheeler et al. [34] also
    tested a smart irrigation system in a container nursery and greenhouse. They used
    Decagon soil moisture sensors along with an nR5 wireless node to control irrigation.
    The study reported a water use reduction of approximately 50% when compared to
    grower-controlled irrigation. The same sensor system was trialed previously by
    Wheeler et al. [5] in a floriculture greenhouse. The WSNs are also used in pot-in-pot
    nurseries. Belayneh et al. [37] used this technology to control irrigation in
    dogwood (planted in 15-gal containers) and red maple (planted in 30-gal containers)
    nurseries. The EM50R nodes were used to monitor data from soil moisture, and environmental
    sensors and nR5 nodes were used for irrigation control. Volumetric water content-based
    sensors were utilized for monitoring soil moisture. The sensors were inserted
    at a 6-inch depth for dogwood and at 6 and 12 inches depth for red maple. The
    results showed that the WSNs-based irrigation method reduced water usage by ~34%
    and ~63% for red maple and dogwood, respectively. Lea-Cox and Belayneh [38] developed
    a smart battery-operated nR5 wireless sensor node using a series of soil moisture
    and environmental sensors to irrigate dogwood and red maple nursery blocks. The
    study reduced daily water application by about 62.9%. The authors concluded that
    this sensor-based irrigation technology resulted in nearly a three-fold increase
    in the efficiency of water without reducing the quality or growth of trees. Internet-of-Things
    (IoT)-based smart irrigation systems have also been used for ornamental crop production.
    Banda-Chávez et al. [39] developed an IoT-based sensor network to activate the
    irrigation system to irrigate ornamental plant using an IoT platform and soil
    moisture sensors (YL-69). In addition, Beeson and Brooks [40] used an evapotranspiration
    (ETo) model-based smart irrigation system for wax-leaf privet. The study reported
    that this model-based irrigation system could reduce water application by about
    22.22% annually, compared to the traditional overhead irrigation method. Although
    a limited number of studies have reported on the IoT-based automatic irrigation
    systems used for the ornamental industry, trends and current successes of this
    technology for other crop industries show promising potential for ornamental crop
    production. Although studies have reported the potential of using sensors-based
    technology for irrigation management, many factors impede this technology’s efficacy.
    Sensor-to-sensor variability in a particular environment could be one of them.
    The greatest variability among sensor readings occurred at volumetric water content
    levels just below the water-holding capacity of the substrate. Therefore, finding
    sensor-to-sensor variability in a particular nursery condition can greatly increase
    confidence in the data. Sensor positioning is another important factor that directly
    affects efficacy. Accurate positioning is needed in nursery conditions, particularly
    when measuring soil moisture content in container production. Sensors need to
    be placed in that part of the root zone where active water uptake occurs. Determination
    of optimal sensor numbers is another factor in specifying sensors for a nursery
    environment. The optimal number of sensors for a particular nursery depends primarily
    on the accuracy and repeatability of the sensors, variation among sensors, spatial
    variability of the nursery environment, and cost. Table 1. Summary of studies
    reported for smart nursery irrigation. 2.2. Plant Stress Detection Detection of
    stresses such as drought, disease infection, and pest pressure, recognizes unfavorable
    condition or substance that affects the growth, development or production of plants
    or crops using sensors and advanced technologies [41]. This detection helps growers
    to identify problems and take preventive actions before stresses significantly
    damage plants or crops. Two types of stresses have been identified in ornamental
    crop production: abiotic plant stress and biotic plant stress. Abiotic plant stress
    includes drought, nutrient deficiency, salinity problems, floods, etc., while
    biotic stress refers to damage caused by fungi, bacteria, insects, or weeds. Sensors,
    including RGB, thermal, and spectral, have been utilized to monitor stresses in
    ornamental crop production [42,43,44,45]. A schematic diagram of the sensor-based
    automatic crop disease detection procedure is presented in Figure 3. Figure 3.
    A schematic of a computer-vision-guided dogwood anthracnose leaf disease detection
    procedure. Table 2 represents different ornamental plant disease detection using
    advanced sensing technologies. Red-green-blue (RGB) imaging sensors with a spectrum
    range of 400–700 nm (visible range) are used to monitor ornamental plant stresses
    due to their affordability and application in other cropping systems. Velázquez-López
    et al. [42] developed an image processing-based powdery mildew disease detection
    system for rose plants by using the Open CV library. The system detected powdery
    mildew by converting RGB images to hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color space
    and achieved the highest disease region matching of 93.2% by segmenting with V
    channel using close captured images (captured at 10 cm from the rose canopies).
    Although this study achieved good performance with the traditional image segmentation
    method, the performance would not have been the same if the image capturing conditions
    had changed. This is considered a major limitation, especially for real-time disease
    detection, where multiple diseases would be present. Nuanmeesri [46] advanced
    the image processing technique from traditional image segmentation to deep learning-based
    detection in order to identify up to 15 different diseases. A hybrid deep learning
    model built by fusing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a support vector
    machine (SVM) were used. Researchers also tested the image registration approach
    of two imaging media for ornamental crop disease detection. Minaei et al. [45]
    registered RGB and thermal images to detect powdery mildew and gray mold disease
    on roses for developing a site-specific spraying system. A few studies have compared
    RGB imaging with spectral imaging for tulip disease detection [43,47]. The results
    reported that a spectral imaging system achieved better detection accuracies than
    RGB imaging while detecting tulip breaking virus (TBV). Hyperspectral imaging
    is a powerful tool that uses imaging and spectroscopy for detecting stresses at
    the early stage, gathering and processing feature information from a wide spectrum
    of light. Researchers have used hyperspectral sensors for ornamental crops, but
    mainly in laboratory applications due to their vulnerability in real-time field
    applications [43]. Polder et al. [48] identified Botrytis infected Cyclamen plants
    with selected features (bands) of 497, 635, 744, 839, 604, 728, 542, and 467 nm
    in a controlled greenhouse environment. Poona and Ismail [44] selected wavebands
    located across VIS, red edge, NIR, and SWIR regions to detect Fusarium circinatum
    infection in Pinus radiata seedlings at the asymptomatic stage. The study concluded
    that random forest (RF) is a good machine learning (ML) classifier to discriminate
    disease infection from spectral bands. Heim et al. [49] also used RF to differentiate
    myrtle rust-infected lemon myrtle plants and achieved an overall accuracy of 90%.
    The spectral wavebands (545, 555, 1505, and 2195 nm) were selected for discrimination.
    Considering hyperspectral systems’ slow data processing and expense, some studies
    have tried to find an alternative to hyperspectral imaging. A few studies have
    used the multispectral imaging system instead because of its faster data processing
    ability. Polder et al. [43] used an RGB-NIR-based multispectral system (range
    500–750 nm) to detect TBV disease in tulips and achieved a classification accuracy
    of 92%. They employed a linear discriminant classifier along with R, G, B, and
    NIR features to segment the plant and the soil. The author used features such
    the fraction of red pixels, mean normalized red value, mean normalized green value,
    and ratio of contour pixels of spots to classify disease in tulips. Pethybridge
    et al. [50] assessed ray blight disease (caused by Phoma ligulicola) intensity
    using a hand-held multispectral radiometer with 485, 560, 660, 830, and 1650 nm
    spectral band sensors. The study used vegetation indices, including normalized
    difference vegetative index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetative index
    (GNDVI), difference vegetative index, and renormalized difference vegetative index
    to assess ray blight disease. Thermal imaging has also been tested for stress
    detection in ornamental plants, a technique which depicts the spatial distribution
    of temperature differences in a captured scene by converting infrared (IR) radiation
    into visible images. Jafari et al. [51] classified asymptomatic powdery mildew
    and gray mold disease on roses by fusing thermal images with visible-range captured
    images. Valuable thermal features were extracted, and artificial neural networks
    (ANN) and SVM were used to classify healthy and disease-infected rose plants.
    The thermal features include maximum, minimum, median, mode, standard deviation,
    maximum difference in temperature, skewness, kurtosis, sum of squared errors,
    and so on. Studies have been conducted for disease stress detection using thermal
    imaging; however, this type of sensing is more practical for water stress detection.
    Before conducting the above experiment, Jafari et al. [52] attempted to classify
    Botrytis cinerea infection on rose using thermal spectra and radial-basis neural
    networks. Buitrago et al. [53] analyzed the infrared spectra of plants for water
    stress detection and concluded that spectral changes in plant regions had a direct
    connection with the microstructure and biochemistry of leaves. Stress detection
    technologies are widely used in other crop industries, especially for agronomic
    crops (such as corn and soybean) and tree fruits (such as apple and citrus), but
    very few experiments have been conducted for ornamental crops (mostly in the floriculture
    industry). Very limited research, almost no studies, have been conducted for the
    woody ornamental industry. A few studies have been conducted to detect stress
    using RGB sensors because RGB cameras do not require deep technical knowledge
    to operate or use. Spectral sensors are necessary to detect stress at an asymptomatic
    or early stage. Spectral sensors have a huge potential for the ornamental industry,
    but not much progress has been previously reported. Currently, UAVs are very popular
    for crop stress detection and monitoring, but the applications of these systems
    are also very limited for the ornamental crop industry. De Castro et al. [54]
    used a UAV system to detect water stress in Cornus, Hydrangea, Spiraea, Buddleia
    and Physocarpus, and the results of this study show promise. The ornamental industry
    can benefit from using UAV-based sensing technologies for the timely detection
    and monitoring of stresses to enhance crop production. Table 2. Summary of studies
    reported for plant stress detection.    2.3. Smart Spraying Management of different
    pests and diseases is essential to ensure high quality ornamental nursery crop
    production meeting the market’s requirements [55]. Traditional management techniques
    include pruning the infected branches, removing dead or infected plants, monitoring
    diseases, trapping insects, growing pest-resistant cultivars, and pesticide applications
    [56]. Foliar pesticide application is the most effective method for preventing
    pest infestations and ensuring healthy and unblemished nursery plants [57]. In
    the United States, the greenhouse and nursery industries use about 1.3 million
    kg of pesticides every year, saving billions worth of crops [58]. Conventionally,
    radial air-assisted sprayers are the most used spray equipment for pesticide application
    in ornamental nurseries [59]. These sprayers apply pesticides to the entire field
    regardless of the plant structure, plant growth stage, and absence of plants in
    rows, thus, resulting in under- or over-spraying [60] as well as contaminating
    the environment, wasting pesticides, and increasing production cost [61]. This
    problem is more critical for the nursery industry, as there is great diversity
    in canopy structures and densities found in nursery crops. In field nursery production,
    it is a common practice that trees of different ages and cultivars are planted
    in the same row. The traditional sprayers cannot adjust sprayer settings to match
    the target tree requirements, reducing application efficiency. One way to improve
    spraying efficiency is to use sensing technologies to identify target trees for
    precise spraying applications, also referred to as smart/variable-rate-intelligent
    spraying (Figure 4). Figure 4. A schematic of a light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-guided
    variable-rate spraying system. Smart spraying is defined as the precise application
    of pesticides, performed by controlling the spray output of each nozzle based
    on the presence, structure, and canopy density of plants as obtained from sensors
    such as ultrasound, laser, and cameras [18]. In recent years, significant research
    has been conducted to develop smart spraying systems for the nursery industry.
    Different sensors, such as ultrasonic and laser, have been utilized to measure
    the canopy parameters for intelligent spraying in nursery crops. The summary of
    the reviewed studies is presented in Table 3. The initial efforts for smart nursery
    spraying were reported back in 2010 by a team of scientists from the United States
    [62]. The authors developed two precision sprayer prototypes: a hydraulic boom
    sprayer with an ultrasonic sensor for small narrow trees such as liners and an
    air-assisted sprayer with a laser scanner for other ornamental nursery species.
    The authors compared the spray consumption between a sensor-based sprayer and
    a conventional air blast sprayer at three growing stages and four travel speeds
    (3.2, 4.8, 6.4, and 8.0 km/h). The sensor-based air-assisted sprayer applied 70%,
    66%, and 52% fewer chemicals at different growth stages than conventional spraying.
    The results also reported a uniform spray deposit and coverage regardless of changes
    in the canopy size and travel speed. Jeon and Zhu [63] developed an ultrasonic-sensed
    real-time variable-rate vertical boom sprayer for nursery liners. The sprayer
    consisted of two booms with five pairs of equally spaced nozzles, with the ultrasonic
    sensor mounted 0.35 m ahead of the nozzles. Field tests were conducted for six
    different liner species at travel speeds from 3.2 to 8.0 km/h. The spray nozzles
    were triggered successfully from 4.5 to 12.5 cm ahead of the target, and the effects
    of travel speed on mean spray coverage and deposit were insignificant. Following
    this work, a study for the same precision sprayer was reported for performance
    evaluation based on spray coverage, deposit, and droplet density compared to conventional
    ones for all six-liner cultivars [64]. The reported results suggest that the spray
    coverage, deposit, and droplet density were lower in the sensor-based sprayer,
    and the spray volume was reduced by 86.4% compared to the conventional sprayer.
    Laser sensing is another technology used for precision spraying for many tree
    crops. A few studies have been reported that utilize laser scanning for smart
    spraying applications in nurseries. Chen et al. [57] developed a variable-rate
    air-assisted sprayer using a laser scanner. The authors reported that the spray
    coverage differences inside the canopies were not statistically significant at
    3.2 and 6.4 km/h travel speeds. Liu et al. [65] used a laser scanner to develop
    an intelligent variable-rate air-assisted sprayer and tested the system in a commercial
    nursery and grapevine orchard. The authors reported that the new sprayer reduced
    chemical usage by more than 50% compared to the conventional sprayer at a travel
    speed of 3.2 to 8.0 km/h. Shen et al. [66] developed an air-assisted laser-guided
    sprayer for Japanese maple nursery trees. The new sprayer consisted of a 270°
    radial-range laser scanner, embedded controller, and pulse-width-modulated (PWM)
    nozzles. The authors reported an accurate measurement of different trees and control
    of nozzles to match trees independently. The spray usage was reduced by 12 to
    43%, compared to the conventional spraying. In addition, a few studies have been
    reported for field validation of precision sprayers to control different diseases.
    Zhu et al. [59] validated the laser-guided air-assisted sprayer and reported a
    chemical saving of about 36% and 30% in the Prairifire crabapple and Honey locust
    nurseries, respectively. Chen et al. [67] also conducted a performance comparison
    of laser-guided air-assisted sprayers with conventional sprayers in commercial
    nurseries with different test plants. The author reported 56% and 52% chemical
    savings for two nurseries. Similarly, a few other studies have compared the performance
    of smart laser-guided sprayers with conventional sprayers and reported promising
    results for effective disease control in different nursery crops [61,68]. Table
    3. Summary of studies reported for smart nursery spraying.   Smart spraying for
    nursery crops using different sensing technologies, mainly ultrasonic and laser,
    has been reported in the last decade. Ultrasonic and laser sensors were integrated
    with conventional sprayers to detect the target (e.g., canopies). Although ultrasonic
    sensor-based sprayers exhibit significant chemical savings, their accuracy varies
    with temperature, humidity, and detection distance [57]. On the other hand, laser
    sensors are less influenced by weather conditions when detecting and measuring
    target characteristics [69]. Moreover, the nursery industry encounters several
    unique challenges, such as the lack of crop uniformity, varying shapes, sizes,
    growth patterns, and harvest schedules. Most existing sprayers have been developed
    for the orchard environment [59]; modifications may be required to make them usable
    for ornamental nursery crop production. Another challenge for the ornamental industry
    is its high aesthetic thresholds allowing for no visible infections. Thus, efforts
    are required to develop a smart spraying system based on the requirements of the
    nursery industry. 2.4. Plant Biometrics and Identification Information on plant
    physiology and responses to biotic/abiotic stresses are critical to determine
    the management practices required to improve productivity and sustainability in
    the nursery industry. Plant biometry (e.g., structural information) can assist
    in understanding the plant’s growth differences in diverse environments [70].
    Cultivar identification of nursery plants is also important for breeding, reproduction,
    and cultivation [71]. Plant biometry is a classification system that distinguishes
    a plant by defining its authenticity using physiological characteristics. The
    defined biometric for an individual plant should be universal, distinctive, permanent,
    and collectible [72]. Plant identification, inspection, and a precise count of
    each cultivar’s number and size distribution are essential for nursery management
    and efficiently marketing the trees [73] (Figure 5). Figure 5. A schematic of
    a UAV-based tree canopy characteristics measurement system. Different sensors,
    including cameras and LiDAR, have been utilized for nursery plant biometrics.
    The summary of the reviewed studies is presented in Table 4. The research for
    nursery plant identification using camera imaging systems started in the 1990s.
    Shearer and Holmes [74] used a camera vision system to identify tree species in
    the nursery. The study used color co-occurrence matrices derived from intensity,
    saturation, and hue to identify seven common containerized nursery plants. A total
    of 33 texture features were used for the analysis, and the reported classification
    accuracy was 91%. She et al. [75] developed a high-resolution imaging system to
    classify containerized Perennial peanut and Fire chief arborvitae plants for counting.
    he authors found that the classification accuracy of plants with flowers was higher
    (97%) than those without flowers (96%). Leiva et al. [76] developed an unmanned
    aircraft system (UAS)-based imaging system for counting container-grown Fire Chief
    arborvitae. The author developed a custom counting algorithm and tested it on
    different backgrounds, including gravel and black fabric. The reported results
    indicated counting errors of 8% and 2% for gravel and black fabric backgrounds,
    respectively. In another study, the authors used a depth camera for height measurements
    of nursery plants [77]. The authors implemented Ghostnet–YoloV4 Network for measuring
    height and counting different nursery plants, including spruce, Mongolian scotch
    pine, and Manchurian ash. They achieved an accuracy of more than 92% for measurement
    and counting. Gini et al. [78] used a UAS-based multispectral imaging system to
    classify eleven nursery plant species. The author implemented multiple grey level
    co-occurrence matrix algorithms to perform textural analysis of acquired images.
    A principal component analysis was used after feature extraction, achieving a
    classification accuracy of 87% for the selected plants. Likewise, a few studies
    have reported the application of LiDAR sensors to identify nursery plants. Weiss
    et al. [79] developed a method for identifying nursery plant species using a LiDAR
    sensor and supervised machine learning. The author used multiple machine learning
    classifiers and 83 features to identify six containerized nursery plant species,
    and achieved an accuracy of more than 98%. Similarly, LiDAR and light curtain
    sensors were used to develop a stem detection and classification system for almond
    nursery plants [73]. The authors developed a custom segmentation and thresholding
    algorithm, and the reported detection accuracies with the LiDAR and light curtain
    sensors were 95.7% and 99.48%, respectively. The success rates for dead/alive
    plant detection for the LiDAR and light curtain sensors were 93.75% and 94.16%,
    respectively. Additionally, a few other studies have reported the application
    of machine vision approaches using different machine learning and deep learning
    methodologies for detecting and classifying different flower nurseries [71,80,81,82,83,84].
    Table 4. Summary of studies reported for plant biometric measurements. Nursery
    crop management is time-consuming and labor-intensive, bringing a great need for
    automation, especially for large nursery production areas. Sensing-based plant
    biometrics, identification, and recognition are promising but challenging tasks.
    The rapid advancements in sensing, computation, artificial Intelligence (AI),
    and data analytics have allowed more detailed investigations in this domain. Research
    has been reported to identify tree species for management operations and counting
    plants for inventory control using different types of sensors, including RGB,
    multispectral, LiDAR, etc. A few recent studies have utilized state-of-art deep
    learning techniques for nursery plant classification; however, more efforts are
    needed to facilitate the growers’ use of such techniques for the profitability
    and sustainability of the nursery industry. 2.5. Other Significant Works The economics
    of production practices associated with fertilizer inputs, pest control needs,
    and labor requirements affect the nursery industry. Most nursery production operations
    are labor intensive. According to Gunjal et al. [85], labor accounts for 70% of
    the costs for nursery production. Though a few operations in nursery production
    have been mechanized, many others have not been automated. Advanced sensing and
    mechanization/automation could reduce resource consumption and labor dependence
    [73]. In this context, the ornamental nursery industry has witnessed some progress
    in different sensing, automation, and robotic applications. Table 5 presents the
    summary of works related to other sensing and automation applications for nursery
    crop production. Li et al. [86] developed a trimming robot for ornamental plants.
    The design includes a knife system and a rotary base, allowing the knife to rotate
    360 degrees to cut the plants into the desired shape. The robot was tested for
    five different nursery plant species (Aglaia odorata, Murraya exotica, Camellia
    oleifera, Osmanthus fragrans, and Radermachera sinica), and results indicated
    that the overall performance was above 93% with the time taken as 8.89 s. Zhang
    et al. [87] developed a path-planning scheme for a watering robot for containerized
    ornamental nursery plants. The authors optimized the robot’s path planning using
    a genetic algorithm with neighbor exchanging to test different watering strategies,
    and achieved promising results in terms of water savings. Sharma and Borse [88]
    developed an autonomous mobile robot to carry out different production operations
    in the nursery. The robot featured multiple sensor modules, including camera and
    climate monitoring, to perform real-time growth monitoring, disease detection,
    and the spraying of fertilizer, pesticide, and water. The platform was also equipped
    with a Zigbee communication framework to transmit the sensed data to the central
    control system. The system achieved the desired results for disease detection
    and growth monitoring; however, no technical details are provided. Similarly,
    a conceptual design of a cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) to perform different
    operations, including seeding, weeding, and nutrition monitoring for plant nurseries
    has been presented [89]. The authors performed the operational and path planning
    simulation to execute seeding and weeding operations. Additionally, a pretrained
    VGG16 model was used for weed identification, and results showed promise, with
    an accuracy of 96.29% achieved during testing. Despite some progress, the status
    of research-based findings for robotic applications in the nursery industry lags
    far behind its contemporary industries. Table 5. Summary of works related to nursery
    production in other remaining areas. 3. Future Prospects/Directions 3.1. Advanced
    Camera Sensor Applications 3.1.1. ToF, LiDAR, and 3D Sensors Applications Advanced
    sensing technologies, such as depth cameras, time-of-flight (ToF) cameras, and
    multispectral and hyperspectral cameras, have been widely used in different agricultural
    applications. Kim et al. [90] implemented a binocular stereo-vision camera incorporated
    with a single-board computer for estimating crop height. Authors successfully
    estimated heights for Chinese cabbage, potato, sesame, radish, and soybean crops
    with a less than 5% of error in field conditions. Wang et al. [91] developed a
    ground-based remote imaging system comprised of an ultrasonic sensor, a LiDAR
    sensor, a Kinect camera, an imaging array of four digital cameras, and a custom-developed
    gimble and camera, respectively, for estimating sorghum plant height at plot level.
    The author observed that an ultrasonic sensor, a LiDAR sensor, and a Kinect camera
    resulted in strong correlations (r ≥ 0.90) between automatic and manual measurements
    for plant height estimation. The study concluded that the ground-based image acquisition
    system resulted in a comparatively higher correlation between automatic and manual
    measurements compared to the remote imaging system. They recommended LiDAR combined
    with high-resolution camera array technology, which can be an ideal methodology
    for measuring plant height effectively. The 3D/Depth cameras have found widespread
    usage in agriculture for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to yield
    estimation [92], plant phenotyping [93], and disease detection [94]. A vision-based
    under-canopy navigation and mapping system for corn and sorghum was developed
    by Gai et al. [95] using a ToF camera combined with a field robot, PhenoBot 3.0.
    They implemented linear programming techniques and developed a novel algorithm
    for reliable crop row detection and navigation. The developed system achieved
    mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.4 cm and 3.6 cm in fields of corn and sorghum,
    respectively. Similarly, Gongal et al. [96] fused a color charge coupled device
    (CCD) camera and a ToF sensor to estimate apple fruit size under controlled lighting
    conditions. The developed system estimated apple fruit size with an accuracy of
    84.8% based on pixel size. A few of the most significant applications for ToF
    cameras in agriculture are plant height estimation [97,98], 3D reconstruction
    of the plant [99], 3D plant morphology [100], palm bunch grading [101], and so
    on. 3.1.2. Spectral Sensor Applications Cao et al. [102] developed a nitrogen
    monitoring system for tea plants using multispectral (wavelengths: 475 nm, 560
    nm, 668 nm, 717 nm, and 840 nm) and hyperspectral imaging systems. They fused
    data after preprocessing, which included multispectral image registration, calibration,
    information extraction and selection, and hyperspectral wavelength selection.
    After filtering the fused data, they feed them to regression models, including
    PLS regression, random forest regression (RFR), and support vector machine regression
    (SVR), to predict the nitrogen content of tea leaves. The support vector machine
    regression outperformed other models and achieved R2 (coefficient of determination)
    and root mean square error values of ~0.92 and ~0.06, respectively. Another researcher,
    Chandel et al. [103], also used simple linear regression models (LRs) to experiment
    on characterizing Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) crop vigor and yield by combining
    multispectral (465–860 nm) and thermal infrared (11,000 ± 3000 nm) image data
    collected from unmanned aerial vehicles. The model MLR-4 outperformed other models
    and achieved an R2 of 0.64. The aforementioned studies offer compelling evidence
    of increased success rates for agricultural applications of cutting-edge sensors,
    which suggest prospective uses for ornamental nursery crops. The advanced sensors
    can operate successfully in both indoor and outdoor environments. Therefore, in
    the future, automated systems for ornamental nursery corps can be developed using
    sophisticated camera sensors like 3D or depth cameras, ToF, multispectral, and
    hyperspectral. 3.2. Enhanced Deep Network Applications Due to the extraordinary
    ability to generate synthetic datasets with the same properties as training datasets,
    advanced computer vision-based techniques such as generative adversarial networks
    (GANs) and transformers are overtaking photometric and geometric-based augmentation
    approaches in a variety of agricultural problems. Abbas et al. [104] proposed
    a tomato plant disease detection system using a publicly available plant village
    tomato leaf dataset. The authors augmented the dataset using a conditional generative
    adversarial network (C-GAN) and fed the data to a pre-trained DenseNet network.
    The network successfully predicted tomato leaf diseases from healthy leaves and
    achieved an accuracy of 97.11%. The augmentation of the tomato leaf dataset improved
    the DenseNet network’s prediction by 2.77% compared to the accuracy of the original
    plant village tomato leaf dataset. Xiao et al. [105] implemented Texture Reconstruction
    Loss CycleGAN (TRL-GAN) to produce phenotypic data for the citrus greening disease
    and improve classification networks for the detection of diseased leaves. The
    authors observed that the TRL-GAN based method improved accuracy by 2.76% compared
    to the baseline model and 1.04% compared to the traditional augmentation methods
    (rotation and stretching). Zhang et al. [106] combined hyperspectral imaging with
    generative adversarial networks (DCGAN, CGAN) to expand the original dataset.
    They also observed that expansion of the dataset using GANs would improve the
    accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN), SVM, and RF for haploid maize kernel classification
    by 12%, 20%, and 12%, respectively, compared to baseline models. Data enlargement
    using GANs allows for the development of detection, classification, and prediction
    models with less data on ornamental nursery crop images, which increases the model’s
    resilience in varying conditions and improves performances or accuracies. The
    augmented data can be incredibly useful when developing machine vision-based systems
    for nursery crops, such as leaf classification and disease assessment systems.
    Robots may be trained in a simulated environment using the data produced by GANs.
    3.3. Edge-AI Applications Embedded platforms combined with hardware accelerators
    and artificial intelligence-based sensing technology, called Edge Artificial Intelligence
    (Edge-AI), have made quick responses with low latency possible over cloud-based
    solutions. This technique has been adopted in different agricultural applications
    in recent years. Mazzia et al. [107] developed a real-time apple detection system
    using an Edge-AI technology. They implemented YOLOv3-Tiny algorithms on three
    different embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with Intel Movidius
    Neural Computing Stick (NCS), Nvidia’s Jetson Nano and Jetson AGX Xavier, and
    successfully detected apples in an orchard. Their system achieved an accuracy
    of 83.64% with a data processing speed up to 30 frames per second (fps) in complex
    situations. Zhang et al. [108] implemented YOLOv4-Tiny networks combined with
    improved cross stage partial networks (CSPNet) in the backbone for strawberry
    detection and implemented a developed model on the embedded platform Jetson Nano
    (NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Their optimized model (RTSD-Net) with
    TensorRT achieved about 25.20 fps and performed 15% faster than the original YOLOv4-tiny
    model on Jetson Nano without significant loss of accuracy. Other promising applications
    of Edge-AI are air temperature forecasting [109], environment monitoring [110],
    autonomous navigation systems [111] and so on. Edge-AI technology can potentially
    be applied for weeding, spraying, and robot navigation in ornament nursery crop
    production. Weed maps generated by UAVs may be combined into autonomous robots
    for site-specific weed management and pesticide applications in the field. Embedded
    hardwire (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, and Jetson TX2) paired with sensors (color
    camera, depth camera), and AI may be implemented to develop Edge-AI technology
    for ornamental nursery crops. Vision-based robots using Edge-AI technology can
    be an aid to robot navigation for accomplishing site-specific applications in
    nursery crops. 3.4. Radio Frequency Identification Tagging Applications Radio
    frequency identification (RFID) technology has become popular in different fields
    of agriculture, including soil environment monitoring, soil moisture monitoring,
    soil solarization, and automation in irrigation. Deng et al. [112] designed and
    developed a novel system that integrates an RFID sensor with LoRa to provide a
    low-cost, low-power, and efficient soil environment monitoring solution. The authors
    embedded RFID tags at 60 cm into the soil; the tags can communicate with the monitoring
    center through radio communication (LoRa) placed in the patrol car. Their system
    would be able to establish communication within a range of 1.3 m without compromising
    relative measurement errors (temperature: 1.5% and soil moisture content: 1.0%).
    The study achieved a higher communication rate (above 90%) at a patrol speed of
    33 kmh−1. Luvisi et al. [113] developed a system that monitors different types
    of soil solarization (sandy, loam, and clay soils) using an RFID sensor and biodegradable
    films. They placed soil sensors at different depths (5 and 10 cm) along with a
    soil profile at different soil moisture holding capacities (10%, 50%, and 90%)
    and measured the effect of soil solarization treatment. In the second and third
    weeks of treatment, they found that the maximum soil temperature at depths of
    5 and 10 cm increased to 9–13 °C and 11–14 °C, respectively. They also found that
    the method was 90% reliable. Vellidis et al. [114] implemented soil moisture sensors
    (Watermark® granular resistive type) and thermocouple temperature sensors coupled
    with RFID tags (WhereNet®, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for developing sensor nodes to
    automate irrigation schedules for cotton crops. The nodes were connected to a
    laptop computer via wireless communication. The developed system contained an
    array of sensors, and data obtained from the sensors could assist in decision-making
    and scheduling irrigation for the cotton field. Several researchers also contributed
    to RFID-based soil moisture sensor developments [115,116,117,118,119]. RFID-based
    sensors also have other applications in agriculture, including tracking plants
    in pots in greenhouses [120], tracing food quality [121], and monitoring livestock
    [122]. The above studies and their success rates clearly show the potential of
    using RFID-based sensors in ornamental nursery crop applications. The potential
    applications of RFID-based sensors for nursery crops include soil environment
    monitoring, soil solarization, and automating irrigation scheduling, in indoor
    or field conditions. The RFID tags can be used in conjunction with soil monitoring
    sensors such as soil, moisture, soil micronutrient, gas, etc. to build sensor
    nodes and receive in-field data through wireless communications. Readings from
    sensor nodes may be used with machine learning and deep learning to make decisions
    in various field management operations. 3.5. Integrated Robotics Applications
    Robots integrated with computer vision have been widely adopted in many areas
    of agriculture, such as plant detection and mapping, fruit detection and localizations,
    robot-based harvesting, navigation, and obstacle detection systems. Weiss and
    Biber [123] developed a ground-based robot for maize plant recognition, mapping,
    and navigation using a 3D LiDAR sensor-based micro-electro-mechanical system (FX6
    3D LiDAR). The robot was constructed using modeled artificial maize plants and
    tested on a small corn field. The designed robot achieved detection and mapping
    accuracy of around 60%–70%. They measured a greater localization deviation in
    the direction of the row, measuring 1–2 cm. Ge et al. [124] developed a strawberry
    fruit localization method using a strawberry harvesting robot with an RGB-D camera.
    The authors implemented a convolutional neural network (i.e., Mask-RCNN) on RGB
    images for strawberry fruit segmentation and combined depth values to obtain 3D
    points of fruits. The 3D point was then used to obtain fruit localization using
    the shape completion method. The system achieved a minimum center deviation of
    6.9 mm between ground truths and automated measurements. Skoczeń et al. [125]
    also proposed a similar approach to develop an automatic obstacle-detection robot.
    They implemented an RGB-D camera (Intel RealSense D435i) for robot vision, reached
    obstacle segmentation accuracy of 98.11%, and obtained a depth measurement error
    of 38 cm. Ji et al. [126] developed a machine vision algorithm for a green pepper
    harvesting robot. The contrast values of images obtained by the camera (MX808)
    for various light conditions (normal, weak, and strong light) were then increased
    to make the green pepper stand out from the background leaf. The energy-driven
    sampling (SEEDS) algorithm is then fed the improved images to build super pixel
    blocks. The manifold ranking (MR) algorithm, the CART classifier, and the conditional
    random field (CRF) algorithm were used to recognize green pepper from super pixel
    blocks, followed by morphological processing. Classifiers were evaluated on 500
    images obtained from different lighting conditions. The algorithm manifold ranking
    outperformed other classifiers and achieved an accuracy of 83.6%; it took 116
    milliseconds to run the entire evaluation on Intel Core (TM) i5-4210U CPU (2.80
    GHz, 8 GB). Gai et al. [127] developed a cherry fruit detection system using a
    high-resolution Sony DSC-HX400 camera combined with a YOLO-V4 Dense Model network.
    The study compared the developed algorithm’s accuracy with the base model, YOLO-V3-dense,
    and YOLO-V4 and observed an improved detection rate (F1 scores: 94.70%). YOLO-V4
    Dense Model took 0.467 s on an Intel Core (TM) i7-7700 CPU (3.60 GHz, 4 GB) with
    a Tesla V100 GPU for processing an image of 1280 by 800 pixels. They found robotic
    intelligent picking is possible using the developed system. Jia et al. [128] also
    developed a robot vision using a high-resolution camera (6000 × 4000 pixel) for
    an apple harvesting robot using an optimized Mask R-CNN. The developed system
    achieved a high rate of detection (precision: 97.31%; recall: 95.70%). The development
    of robot vision using high-resolution camera sensors combined with deep learning
    techniques can be adopted to develop ornamental crop management robots. Applications,
    such as spraying, weeding, soil sampling, and digging could be effectively solved,
    enabling different operations in nursery crops. Robot vision combined with machine
    and deep learning may also be implemented in nurseries for plant counting, stem
    counting, and other essential tasks. 4. Discussion and Conclusions The ornamental
    crop industry in the U.S. depends largely on agricultural workers. Sensing and
    automation technologies offer a huge potential to reduce labor dependency and
    ensure the efficient use of resources required by the ornamental industry. In
    turn, the information in this article can aid the nursery industry in knowing
    about the specific area where technological development takes place and what those
    technologies are, and in considering what types of sensors, algorithms and tools
    are advantageous to develop effective technologies in different production operations.
    Current sensing and automation technology usage varies by production operations.
    For instance, smart irrigation has primarily relied on soil moisture sensors,
    and stress detection has largely depended on camera sensors. Despite the fact
    that not many studies have used IoT or Edge-AI-based IoT systems, these could
    be potential technologies for automating irrigation operations for ornamental
    crops. The Edge-AI-based systems and AI-of-things (AIoT) are relatively new concepts
    in agricultural applications, and successes in other cropping systems have shown
    promise for the ornamental nursery industry. Similar to irrigation, a very limited
    number of studies have been conducted for ornamental plant stress detection. One
    important fact regarding stresses is that they have to be detected early to minimize
    their effect on crops. Spectral cameras, including hyperspectral and multispectral
    devices, are the two sensors currently being used to detect stresses at the asymptomatic
    stage. However, the major challenge of detecting plant stresses is to detect them
    in real-time field conditions. Researchers have been trying to address challenges
    such as illumination variations, data processing speed, and environmental factors
    to make a viable system for real-time applications. More efforts are required,
    though, especially for the hyperspectral system, due to its slow data processing
    issues. Fluorescence sensors are another spectral technology that has not been
    explored much for ornamental crops, one which can provide improved spectroscopy
    data and can be useful for early plant stress detection. LiDAR is one of the powerful
    tools that can be used to accurately measure plant biometric information (plant
    height, width, canopy volume and density, etc.) to develop a smart or variable-rate
    spraying system. However, this tool cannot be used for spot spraying operations
    for disease management because the LiDAR sensor can only provide point cloud information
    (unlike cameras, it does not provide any color information). Integrated LiDAR
    and camera systems could potentially be tools for smart spraying systems for ornamental
    nursery crop production. The advantages and disadvantages of different sensors
    are presented in Table 6. Table 6. Advantages and disadvantages of different sensors
    for ornamental crops. Surprisingly, very few applications have been noticed for
    UAVs in ornamental crops, despite extensive implications these days in the agronomic,
    tree fruit and row crops. The low manufacturing cost and fast operation speed
    have opened up further research opportunities for UAVs. UAVs are becoming an essential
    part of remote sensing and can be an effective tool for ornamental plant stress
    detection and monitoring crop growth and development. The UAVs bring advantages
    over ground-based systems, such as their flexibility in capturing ultra-high spatial
    and temporal resolution data at any terrain conditions, and they require less
    time to collect data. However, developing manipulation systems for UAVs that can
    act with precision in fields is a challenging task requiring extensive investigations.
    The coordination between UAVs and ground-based systems has been receiving increasing
    attention in recent years, and has the potential to benefit the ornamental crop
    industry for site-specific management. Calibrating sensors is essential to reduce
    variability when multiple sensors are involved in a particular crop management
    operation. Recent advances in deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, GANs, transformers)
    have contributed significantly to different industries, including agriculture,
    but ornamental crops remain at the bottom user of these impressive innovations.
    These models can help predict stress, pest pressure, growth, yield, etc. RFID,
    a new crop tracking technology, can increase production operations’ efficacy and
    help nurseries to reduce the burden for growers or laborers by automating the
    inspections and recording accurate ornamental crop data instantly. Agricultural
    robotics is another critical area that can benefit the ornamental crop industry
    enormously. Currently, the agricultural workforce conducts most production operations,
    such as planting, pruning/shape forming, weeding, disease monitoring, and harvesting.
    These operations are vastly labor-intensive and cost a large portion of production
    expenses. Autonomous robotic systems can replace the humans conducting these operations.
    The systems will reduce time and production expenses in the long run. The ornamental
    industry lacks automation/robotic technologies; therefore, significant research
    needs to be done on these topics to develop some implementable robotic systems.
    As the majority of the ornamental crop farms are not so large compared to other
    major cropping industries, adopting advanced sensing and automation technologies
    would be a major challenge due to the initial high investment. Integrated multipurpose
    automated technologies will be helpful for this purpose. For instance, when a
    particular automated system can work for multiple operations (e.g., planting,
    pruning, and harvesting) for ornamental crops by replacing a few parts of the
    system, growers would be interested in buying and adopting those multipurpose
    systems. Researchers and manufacturers need to consider these points while working
    on or developing technologies for the ornamental nursery crop industry. Although
    not much progress in sensing and automation technologies has been observed for
    ornamental nursery crop production, a few mechanized systems are available for
    commercial scales. These include mixing systems to mix substrate or soil, potting
    systems to fill containers, tray filling systems to fill trays, planters to plant
    nursery liners in containers, seeding systems to sow and space out seeds on pots
    or containers, etc. Pack Manufacturing (http://packmfg.com/) (Pack Manufacturing
    Inc., McMinnville, TN, USA) is a leading company in the sale of these mechanized
    systems. A vital challenge in technology development for ornamental nursery crops
    is the substantial number of available plant species. Various ornamental plants
    have different morphologies, characteristics, canopy structures, and growth requirements.
    It is necessary to understand the types of plants grown and their production requirements
    to align the sensing and automation technologies with the production needs to
    facilitate industry operations. Author Contributions All authors contributed equally

    IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Robots developed
    for weeding and spraying pesticides can target specific crops. It can easily reduce
    labour and mundane farm tasks when removing weeds or spraying pesticide. Weeding
    robots can be incredibly precise and can reduce pesticide use by 90% thanks to
    computer vision. With Edge Computing, we can solve the infrastructure requirements
    and the need for network connectivity. Using edge computers, we can deploy models
    and heavy applications directly to the robot. This reduces dependence on cloud
    services. Edge computing plays a key role in rapidly detecting the crop and providing
    feedback to components. The Edge computer supports the use of high-quality cameras
    that capture Full HD images at a very high frame rate. Together, AI and Edge Computing
    are revolutionizing applications ranging from agriculture to healthcare. YOLOv5
    is an object detection algorithm used to detect crops[5] [6]. SECTION II. Related
    Work and Survey According to various articles, computer science can play a significant
    role in modernizing the agriculture sector. Weeding and pesticide spraying are
    both time-consuming procedures. According to the articles and research, this challenge
    can be tackled utilizing ML and DL techniques[1] [2]. Deep Learning using CNN
    may be used to recognize crop rows and choose the best path to go. While some
    articles claim that employing proper cameras can enhance model accuracy, it is
    extremely dependent on crop and geographical circumstances such as sunshine and
    topography. Depth cameras have been proposed as being extremely beneficial for
    creating agricultural field maps as occupancy grids and placing the robot in crop
    rows. The crop rows may be mapped using a depth camera with an average mean absolute
    error (MAE) of 3.5. Detecting crops with ResNet50, MobileNet, and a few more bespoke
    CNN Models yielded an accuracy of 97 percent. These Deep Learning models, on the
    other hand, may be deployed on Edge Computers to give superior analytical capability
    and boost weeding efficacy. Farming costs might potentially be computed using
    Machine Learning algorithms based on data collected by the robot. Identifying
    crops that can be produced in certain locations and weeds might assist narrow
    down the pesticides that can be used. All crops are vulnerable to insects. The
    kill-rate of the robot can be used to gauge its performance. It is the proportion
    of crops that have been destroyed owing to incorrect detection. Many factors can
    cause detection to fail, including diseased crops, crops in the early phases of
    growth, and false negatives and false positives in detection[14]. The Model Deployment
    pipeline research identified ways to enhance efficiency by automating tasks and
    deploying the robot. Impact the Agriculture Industry with a Bot that Can Reduce
    Labour and in Turn Reduce Cost- Farmers/ Farm Owners have to pay heavy labour
    costs that accounts to 40% of their expense. This leaves them with very little
    to buy other products. Paying for water and electricity for pumps would bring
    their income to almost zero[3] [4]. Use AI to Bring Farm Products To consumers
    Faster and More Efficiently Using deep learning models, a bot can identify crops
    and weeds separately. This can be used to spray pesticides only on the weeds on
    not on the crop. This reduces the amount of pesticide used, thereby reducing cost.
    Promote Organic Farming- Spraying pesticide on crops makes in unsafe for consumption.
    Today, the consumer base is shifting towards organic farming and to support this,
    AI can be used to avoid spraying pesticides on the produce. Data Collection and
    Analysis- When a Bot is used to Spray and Detect Crops, the system can be scaled
    to collect more raw data that can be processed to derive information that can
    be used to strategize farming. For example, Soil Condition, Moisture, Disease,
    Age etc [7]–[9] [15]. SECTION III. Theory and Fundamentals Edge Computing- Edge
    computing is the process of physically bringing computational capacity closer
    to the source of data, which is often an IoT device or sensor. It is named after
    the method through which computing power is sent to a device''s or network''s
    “edge” Edge computing is used to accelerate data processing, expand bandwidth,
    and maintain data sovereignty. Edge computing lowers the need for huge volumes
    of data to travel between servers, the cloud, and devices or edge locations by
    processing data at the network''s edge. This eliminates the infrastructural difficulties
    that plague traditional data processing, such as latency and bandwidth[12] [13].
    Fig 1 shows where the edge devices are placed in a system and Fig 2 shows the
    side and top view of the device. Table 1 describes the specifications of NVIDIA
    Jetson NX used. Fig. 1. Edge computing system Show All Fig. 2(a). Nvidia jetson
    nx device side view Show All Fig. 2(b). Nvidia jetson nx device top view Show
    All Table. 1. Nvidia jetson nx specification GPUs and FPGAs use entirely distinct
    architectures. GPUs are essentially incredibly fast and efficient computer devices
    comprised of several parallel processors. GPUs are designed to do parallel calculations
    (many parallel ALUs) and provide rapid memory access. FPGAs are made up of an
    array of logic gates that may execute any digital application that the developer
    desires. An FPGA can function as a networking switch, a CPU, or a bitcoin miner.
    FPGA provides the most versatility to the digital engineer. Processing Power FPGAs
    are programmable semiconductors that can be programmed to do any digital function
    or computation. As a result, FPGAs may be designed to incorporate GPUs. While
    this is valid, it is vital to remember that the programmability capabilities of
    FPGAs introduce delays into all logic gates and internal routing. This means that
    in some instances, a GPU might outperform an FPGA and become a more capable processing
    unit. Programming FPGAs may be programmed using HDL (Hardware Description Language),
    which includes VHDL and Verilog. GPUs may be set using general-purpose software
    programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python, among others. Convenience
    GPUs, in comparison, are easier to use than FPGAs since the latter''s development
    process is considerably more knowledge intensive and sophisticated than the former,
    which explains why GPUs are now being used in a wide range of disciplines. SECTION
    IV. Design and Implementation Crop Detection Model- Crops are considered as objects
    and YOLOv5 is used to train a model than can inference the crop from a given image.
    Artificial intelligence is the process of incorporating human intellect into machines
    using a set of rules (algorithm). Fig. 3. Model training process Show All Crops
    are considered as objects and YOLOv5 is used to train a model than can inference
    the crop from a given image. The application proposed, is key to improving the
    efficiency of the Models used for Crop Detection. The detection results in false
    positive and false negative as the undesired outcomes. Classifying these false
    positives and false negatives will correct the model once it is trained with the
    classified false outcomes. Let us understand the process from capturing image
    to training the model in figure 3. The Images are collected directly from the
    crop fields. A dataset is formed with thousands of images. The images in the dataset
    are then subjected to pre-processing[10] [11]. The images are resized to 760x760
    from Full HD(1920x1080). Preprocessing is required to clean image data for model
    input. The input must be uniform, and the values must be valid for training. There
    are many annotation tools such as Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT), LabelImg.
    Images are used in RGB form for training. The dataset is then used to train the
    model using YOLOv5. The trained model is deployed in a ROS node in the bot. Figure
    4 shows the detection of ground truth and prediction. To increase the recall of
    the model, the images captured by the bot are used as test inputs and the false
    positive and false negatives are categorized. The categorized data is then used
    to re-train the model. Every prediction has score. Only those with a score below
    a threshold will be subject to categorization. The threshold can be decided based
    on the current recall of the model. The categorized images are exported as JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) with image links and other data. This JSON will be used
    for training the model with the corrected data. The entire process is shown in
    figure 5. The JSON is obtained either from the server or can be uploaded from
    the application. Fig. 4. Detection of ground truth and prediction Show All Fig.
    5. Model improvement process Show All The categories are associated with a class
    number. Each error is marked with a unique class. Every box in the JSON has a
    parameter called type. Type indicated either ground truth (gt) or prediction (pred).
    Only the prediction is used for categorization. The errors are categorized based
    on various characteristics like disease, age etc. The training is done with a
    batch size of 80 and 1200 epochs. After multiple trials, the observation was that
    using more epochs and smaller batch size increased the precision. Python3 train.py
    -batch 80 -epochs 1200 -data ‘data/cotton_project_6001’ -weights “ -cfg ‘models/cotton3
    _1.yaml’ –-cache Performance Metrics The performance metrics used are precision
    and recall. Precision (p) and recall(r) P= No.ofcorrectly detected bounding box
    No.ofground−Truth bounding box R= No.ofc.orrectly detected bounding box No.of
    detected bounding box View Source Training Details NVIDIA Jetson NX was used to
    train the model as it has high GPU capacity. The number of images used for different
    crops are: Cotton: 100k Brinjal:50k Tomato:70k Chilli: 80k A higher number of
    epochs is done, so that the prediction could be as accurate as possible, furthermore
    lesser the batch size, the model can predict or identify the crop correctly. SECTION
    V. Simulation Results and Analysis A. Simulation Results There are various metrics
    used to measure the accuracy and performance of an object detection model - precision,
    recall, and mAP at various levels just to name a few. We can even combine these
    metrics to form a new average metric to judge the performance. Fig. 6. Recall
    vs epochs Show All As shown in figure 6, the recall has improved significantly
    in different experiments. The different coloured lines indicate different experiments
    conducted. A t final the recall stands to be at 0.9. B. Performance Analysis The
    crop detection model initially started with 76% precision. Trials with different
    were done. Upon using the error categorization tool, the efficiency of the model
    was significantly increased. The efficiency of the mode increased to 99% from
    97%. Using smaller batches directly increases efficiency. Increasing the number
    of epochs with smaller batches slowed down training but increased the precision.
    As shown in figure 6 the x-axis represents the number of epochs, and the y-axis
    represents the recall. Different experiments conducted are shown in form of coloured
    lines. Observing the change in recall, some experiments were dropped as they didn''t
    show any improvement. Few experiments were done at very high epochs. Such experiments
    were limited. SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Scope A. Conclusion Edge computing
    and artificial intelligence have the ability to reduce human labour while enhancing
    productivity. In agricultural applications, the edge computing paradigm has risen
    in popularity. N VIDIA is a forerunner in the development of GPUs and Edge Computers.
    The NVIDIA Jetson N X device is designed to deliver low latency, mobility, and
    location awareness to delay-sensitive applications. With up to 21 TOPS, Jetson
    Xavier N X is ideal for high-performance computing and artificial intelligence
    in embedded and edge devices. B. Future Scope The capabilities of edge computing
    can be utilized to their full potential by adding more functionality and data
    collection features. Analysing the crop age and detecting if its dead or diseased
    can help in its removal. The bot can be used to collect large amounts of data
    and perform numerous analysis and understand the growth of the plant in various
    environmental conditions. Using smaller batch size and higher epochs can directly
    increase the recall. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This
